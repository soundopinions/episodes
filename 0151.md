A new British survey shows that people who illegally {tag: file-share} can be deterred by warnings from their internet service providers (ISP's). Thus far letters, fines and lawsuits from record companies haven't discouraged music consumers from their illegal activity, so it seems that ISP's might be their only hope. The question remains as to whether or not sharing files is really a crime, but as {host: Jim} points out, this puts ISP's on the level of institutions like the postal service, who monitor illegal activity.

Another study out of {place: the UK} links music tastes with personality. Jim and Greg have always gone by the motto that you are what you listen to. Now there is science to back that theory. {name: Dr. Adrian North} of {tag: Heriot-Watt University} surveyed over 30,000 people to find out what your musical preferences say about you. Find out how [you](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/7598549.stm#style) measure up.

## 00:12:31 Review: AC/DC
![Black Ice](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music4/v4/07/4d/8b/074d8b60-3b27-4527-1243-cf12e0d3759b/source/600x600bb.jpg "5040714/574052242")
According to Dr. North's study if you like harder {genre: rock} you tend to be gentle and creative, but also suffer from low self-esteem, and a bad work ethic. On the plus side you will probably be happy to hear the next review. Classic {genre: hard-rock} group {artist: AC/DC} is back with a new album called {album: Black Ice}. After waiting eight years for a new release, fans are probably curious to hear what's new. The answer is not much. While they are trying out a new distribution model by making their album available only at {tag: Wal-Mart}, AC/DC is not trying out a new sound. On *Black Ice* you'll still hear the band's hallmark rhythms and riffs. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} aren't disappointed though. They've heard this sound for over 30 years and it's still a great one. Greg just wishes their new release was as short and sharp as their former ones. He gives it a {tag: Try It}, and Jim goes with a {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:21:32 Interview: Calexico
{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} are huge fans of {artist: Calexico}, the show's guests this week, but they do present a challenge. The {place: Tuscon}-based group incorporates so many different musical influences that they are almost impossible to define. Singer and guitarist {name: Joey Burns} explains that he's a fan of  "Desert Noir," but even that doesn't fully describe their use of {genre: Latin}, {genre: African} and {genre: jazz} rhythms and instrumentation. The best way to get your head around Calexico's sound is to hear it. They perform live versions of tracks from their new album {album: Carried to Dust}.

## 00:49:41 Review: Bob Dylan
![The Bootleg Series, Vol. 8: Tell Tale Signs - Rare and Unreleased 1989-2006 (Bonus Track Version)](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features6/v4/cf/1c/ce/cf1ccece-3fc0-058d-65f3-c926b2aa4425/dj.lwvbdbtx.jpg/600x600bb-85.jpg "462006/293209884")

{artist: Bob Dylan} has added another album to his "Bootleg Series" called {album: Tell Tale Signs: Rare and Unreleased 1989-2006}. Its songs were primarily from the recording sessions for three albums: {album: Oh Mercy}, {album: Time Out of Mind} and {album: Modern Times}, but for {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} it's almost like a brand new Dylan album. Greg explains that these new versions give a fresh perspective that isn't bogged down by {name: Daniel Lanois}' original production. Jim was not a huge fan of this Dylan period, but he loves that he can hear the singer/songwriter having fun with the songs. Both critics give *Tell Tale Signs* a {tag: Buy It}.
