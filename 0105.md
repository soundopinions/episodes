## 00:01:45 Intro: Music News

While file-sharers in this country face lawsuits, downloaders in {place : France} now risk being thrown off the net entirely. French officials are proposing to cut off the broadband connections of people who illegally download films or music over the internet. French President {name : Nicholas Sarkozy} explained that he's backing a "{tag : three strikes}" policy against internet pirates, while simultaneously announcing a new deal with film and music companies to boost "cultural offerings" on the web. Jim and Greg think that government intervention in this issue sets a troubling precedent. Let's keep our fingers-crossed that U.S. lawmakers don't follow suit (no pun intended).

The {tag : RIAA} is making news yet again this week. Earlier this month, the record industry organization announced that it sent another round of pre-litigation settlement letters to college campuses across the U.S. They are targeting 16 schools, almost all of which are members of the {tag : Ivy League}. But, where's Harvard? The RIAA has offered no response. Jim and Greg aren't quick to join cons{tag : piracy} theorists, but the whole thing is a little peculiar. In fact, the American record industry's tactics in general are very peculiar. But, no more so than those across the pond...

After two successful runs of {tag : Lollapalooza} in {place : Chicago}, concert promoters {tag : C3 Presents} have announced they're going to extend their festival reign to the Garden State. This August C3 and {place : Europe}an promoters {tag : Festival Republic} will launch the {tag : Vineland Music Festival} in {place : Vineland, NJ}. But, music fans shouldn't expect a different formula. The Vineland concert will also be a 3-day destination festival with over 100 bands in various popular music genres. In fact, some acts will overlap with Lollapalooza. Jim and Greg don't understand the need for another big summer music festival when the market is already so glutted with the same product. Everyone, including C3 executives, admit that the market is over-saturated and that many of these festivals won't survive. Sound Opinions H.Q. just hopes that over-heated, over-charged music fans do.



## 00:10:49 Interview: The New Pornographers

Now for a statement late-night shows don't get to make: This week's musical guests: {artist : The New Pornographers}. The Canadian {genre : indie rock} band, who many refer to as a "supergroup," formed in 1997. The members include {name : A.C. Newman}, {name : John Collins}, {name : Todd Fancey}, {name : Kathryn Calder}, {name : Kurt Dahle}, {name : Blaine Thurier}, {name : Dan Bejar} and {name : Neko Case} (though Blaine, Dan and Neko couldn't make it to this interview). Front man and chief songwriter A.C. (Carl) Newman describes the band as just a group of friends who got together to make music. They didn't plan to be popular, and are still "figuring out how to be a band." But while there were no ambitions of fame, there were musical ambitions. The band is known for its sophisticated, complicated take on pop music. You can hear this in the tracks "{track : All the Old Show Stoppers}" and "{track : Adventures in Solitude}," as well as these bonus tracks.

It was with {album : Twin Cinema} in 2005 that the band received the most attention, but as A.C. explains, with attention comes expectations, and expectations are not always good for a band. He and Dan Bejar, who also pens songs for the band, are constantly striving not to repeat themselves. A.C. also strives to live up to his influences-{artist : Jimmy Webb}, {artist : Brian Wilson}, and most importantly, {artist : Burt Bacharach}. That's not a name you hear come up very much with rockers, but AC explains that no album affected him more than a collection of {artist : Dionne Warwick}'s greatest hits. He admits that it might be out of step with the times, but was an example of extraordinary songwriting.



## 00:40:23 Review: Chris Brown

![Exclusive (The Forever Edition)](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/105/1VB0.jpg)

{genre : Pop} sensation {artist : Chris Brown} has a new album out this week that both Jim and Greg predict will spawn a number of hit singles. But our two hosts disagree on whether or not {album : Exclusive} is worth your money. {host : Jim} really enjoyed listening to Brown's take on modern {genre : R&B} -- hints of masculine braggadocio tempered by an old-fashioned sweetness. He gives the record a {tag : Buy It}. {host : Greg} admits that Brown's more mild-mannered approach to the opposite sex is something the genre needs right now, but he insists that talented vocalists like Brown are a dime a dozen. It's the production that makes them stand out, as {artist : Usher} did with his {era : 2004}Â  {artist : Lil John}-produced single "{track : Yeah}." {host : Greg}'s certain Brown will mature to a more interesting sound, but for now he gets a {tag : Burn It}.



## 00:48:03 Review: Damon & Naomi

![Within These Walls](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/105/2830.jpg)

Husband and wife duo {artist : Damon and Naomi} also have a new album out called {album : Within These Walls}. The two were founding members of the "{genre : slowcore}" group {artist : Galaxie 500}, and fans will hear that same {genre : dream-folk}, {artist : Fairport Convention}-inspired sound here. But, Jim and Greg explain that the duo have branched out more on this album by including a brass and string section. {host : Jim}, who says that he loves pretty much anything Damon and Naomi have ever done, is impressed by the experimentation. It led to even more beauty and lushness. He gives {album : Within These Walls} a {tag : Buy It}. {host : Greg} would also encourage listeners to get the album, but takes issue with some of the other instruments. In particular, he says that this album would get a much more enthusiastic rating with the omission of jazz great {artist : Bhob Rainey}'s {tag : soprano sax}, which Greg describes as horribly "{artist : Kenny G}"-like. That said, it gets a Buy It from both critics.
