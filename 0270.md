# Show 270: 1991 & Opinions on Smith Westerns and Wanda Jackson

## 00:01:45 Special: 1991
It's hard to believe, but it has now been two decades since {era: 1991}, a year Jim and Greg believe to be as influential and significant as {era: 1964}, {era: 1976} and other great rock years. 1991's artists, albums and events made way for big changes in the music industry, and the sounds of that year continue to be referenced today. Just look at recent guests {artist: Teenage Fanclub} and {artist: Superchunk}, who both released major albums in 1991 and are still filling our playlists in 2011. While {artist: Bryan Adams} and {artist: Garth Brooks} topped the charts, they don't tell the true story of this year. For {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}, 1991 was all about:

- {artist: Nirvana} and the birth of {genre: grunge}
- {artist: My Bloody Valentine} and the growth of {genre: shoegaze}
- {tag: Lollapalooza} and the rise of the {tag: Alternative Nation}
- {artist: N.W.A.} and the reign of {genre: gangsta rap}
- {artist: Massive Attack} and the birth of {genre: trip-hop}

## 00:41:00 Review: Smith Westerns
![Dye It Blonde](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music69/v4/0b/e6/eb/0be6eb27-2869-62ec-03c6-f4e8f4eb4b54/source/600x600bb.jpg "321076707/1070143989")
{place: Chicago} trio {artist: Smith Westerns} have released their second album, {album: Dye it Blonde}, and {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} are happy to hear that these relative youngsters haven't shied away from their innocence. Their sweet love songs come out of a great tradition of {place: Midwest}ern power {genre: pop}. Plus, adds Greg, when you factor in the guitars and keyboards, the music gets taken to a higher level. He admits there isn't a lot of drive in the rhythms, but on the basis of melody alone, he gives *Dye it Blonde* a {tag: Buy It} rating. Jim also admires the band's songwriting chops. But while the first release was a little too {genre: lo-fi}, this one is a little too polished. Jim says {tag: Buy It}, but would tell the Smith Westerns to go for more grunge next time.

## 00:47:55 Review: Wanda Jackson
![The Party Ain't Over](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/cb/07/6e/cb076e25-8d0b-4089-410b-5562fecbc298/source/600x600bb.jpg "7036716/413923060")
In the {era: '50s}, {artist: Wanda Jackson} was the "First Lady of {genre: Rockabilly}" and a girlfriend of {artist: Elvis Presley}. Today she's partnered up with musician and producer {name: Jack White}. White previously collaborated with {artist: Loretta Lynn}, and now he's again aiming to bring one of his idols into the 21st century. {host: Jim} explains that Jackson has still got her signature voice, but everything else about {album: The Party Ain't Over} does not work. He disagrees with the song selection and holds White to blame. Jim says {tag: Trash It}. {host: Greg} agrees that this record is a disappointment. He wishes White had just let the singer be herself. The modern touches are too forced. But for one track alone, "{track: Blue Yodel #6}", Greg says {tag: Burn It}.
