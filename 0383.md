## 00:49:45 Review: The Strokes
![Comedown Machine](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/383/2AX0.jpg)

It's been 12 years since {artist: The Strokes} debuted with {album: Is This It}, but they appear to be going back in time rather than forward....to the 1980's to be exact. The new album, {album: Comedown Machine}, is packed with references to that era-everything from {artist: Flock of Seagulls} to {artist: Technotronic}. The result, according to {host: Greg}, is a chilly and overproduced album that sounds more like a {name:  Julian Casablancas} [solo project](209/review/thestrokes) than that of an actual band. He says Trash It. {host: Jim} calls {album: Comedown Machine} a "dreadful record," and wishes The Strokes had been able to parlay their minimalist formula as well as {artist: Jack White} has. Sad, but true: The Strokes gets a double {tag: Trash It}.
