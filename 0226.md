# Show 226: SXSW 2010 & Opinions on She and Him
{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} are back from the {place: SXSW Music Festival} to tell you what bands to watch in 2010. Plus they review the latest album from {artist: She and Him}.

## 00:01:45 News: 3.26.2010
{label: Universal Music}, the home to {artist: U2}, {artist: Eminem} and {artist: Lil Wayne}, has decided to drop its {tag: CD prices} to $10 or less. These new prices will certainly be welcome by both consumers and retailers, but {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} wonder if this is a case of too little, too late for the music industry. CDs were nearly $20 a decade ago when physical music sales were at a high. Now that those sales are down, $10 may draw some consumers back in, but it's still a heck of a lot more expensive than an mp3.

Next Jim and Greg remember musician {artist: Alex Chilton} who {tag: died} last week at the age of {tag: 59}. Chilton first came on the scene as the 16-year-old {tag: singer} of {artist: The Box Tops}' "{track: The Letter}." He then joined {artist: Big Star}, and as Jim and Greg explain, became hugely significant to musicians in the {era: 1980's}. Big Star was never a commercial hit, but everyone from {artist: REM} to {artist: The Replacements} has name-checked Chilton and the band's power-pop sound as an {tag: influence}. The singer and songwriter died only days before a scheduled Big Star {tag: reunion} at {place: SXSW}. The event turned into a tribute, one that Greg describes as one of the most memorable shows he's ever seen. To honor Alex Chilton Jim and Greg play a song from Big Star's third release {album: Third/Sister Lovers} called "{track: Thank You Friends}." For more Big Star love, check out the Sound Opinions Classic Album Dissections of [{album: #1 Record}](http://soundopinions.org/show/198/) and [{album: Radio City}](http://soundopinions.org/show/365/).

## 00:10:54 List: SXSW 2010
For decades {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} have been making an annual pilgrimage to {place: Austin, Texas} for the {tag: SXSW Music Festival and Conference}. That makes them industry vets, just like this year's {tag: keynote} speaker {artist: Smokey Robinson}. In the digital age, it's easy to sample music from hundreds, if not thousands of bands from all around the world, but as Jim and Greg explain, a {tag: MySpace} stream has got nothing on the live experience. This is why they and more than 10,000 other people converge on the Texas capital year after year. Here are Jim and Greg's {tag: SXSW} {tag: discoveries} for 2010:

## 00:48:43 Review: She and Him
![Volume Two](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/226/2970.jpg)
This episode's review is {artist: She and Him}'s {album: Volume Two}. The duo of {artist: Zooey Deschanel} and {artist: M. Ward} are back for a second collaboration. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} both enjoyed their previous album, as well as their performance on {tag: Sound Opinions}. Jim, however, is very disappointed in the 2nd volume. He calls it predictable and pedestrian, and thinks it sounds more like Deschanel's cotton commercial than their older {tag: Brill-Building}, cabaret songs. He gives the record a {tag: Trash It} rating. Greg thinks the album is more diverse and surprising than Jim gives it credit for. He is impressed with {name: [Zooey] Deschanel}'s range and heard everything from {genre: country} to {genre: flamenco} to {genre: piano pop}. Greg thinks {album: Volume Two} is better than {album: [Volume] One} and gives the album a {tag: Buy It}.
