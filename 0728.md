English {genre : singer-songwriter}Â  {artist : Michael Kiwanuka} just released his third album, titled {album : Kiwanuka}. While he began his career as more of a retro-infused {genre : folk} artist, he's now moved on to a more contemporary sound while still drawing from his {era : '60s} and {era : '70s} inspirations like {artist : Marvin Gaye} and {artist : Curtis Mayfield}. {host : Jim} loves this album and considers it one of the best of the year. Not only does he dig the sonic elements of the record, he also loves his contemplative lyrics. {host : Greg} agrees and notes that along with singing and writing, Kiwanuka plays killer bass and electric guitar throughout the album. Both hosts love the integration of more {genre : psychedelic rock} a la {artist : Jimi Hendrix} and are excited to see what Kiwanuka does next.
