English {genre: singer-songwriter} {artist: Michael Kiwanuka} just released his third album, titled {album: Kiwanuka}. While he began his career as more of a retro-infused {genre: folk} artist, he's now moved on to a more contemporary sound while still drawing from his {era: '60s} and {era: '70s} inspirations like {artist: Marvin Gaye} and {artist: Curtis Mayfield}. {host: Jim} loves this album and considers it one of the best of the year. Not only does he dig the sonic elements of the record, he also loves his contemplative lyrics. {host: Greg} agrees and notes that along with singing and writing, Kiwanuka plays killer bass and electric guitar throughout the album. Both hosts love the integration of more {genre: psychedelic rock} a la {artist: Jimi Hendrix} and are excited to see what Kiwanuka does next.
