In 1971, {artist : Marvin Gaye} released his iconic album {album : What's Going On}, one that is beloved by many critics and fans alike. This album marked a huge departure for Gaye, as most of his catalogue at the time had mostly consisted of love ballads and upbeat tracks.

He also wrote about his personal struggles, such as difficulties within his marriage and the heartbreaking death of his duet partner and close friend {artist : Tammi Terrell}.

It's time for the next installment of our {tag : Instrumental} series, where we trace  the history of an iconic piece of musical gear. Next up: the {tag : wah-wah pedal}. The {tag : wah} has a distinctive sound that became a building block for {genre : psychedelic rock}, {genre : funk}, and even {genre : reggae} â€“ but its creation back in the {era : mid 1960s} was the product of a technological glitch. {name : Daniel Escauriza} and {name : Shelby Pollard} of {place : Chicago Music Exchange} join us to break down the history of the wah and unpack the science behind the pedal and demonstrate what it adds sonically to iconic riffs.

Jim and Greg explore how legendary musicians from {artist : Eric Clapton} and {artist : Earl Hooker} to {name : Melvin "Wah-Wah" Ragin} and {name : Mikey Chung} used the pedal. They ultimately note that, despite getting a bad rap for being gimmicky, the wah-wah pedal plays a critical role in a number of genres of music.
