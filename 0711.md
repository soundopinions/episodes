In 1971, {artist: Marvin Gaye} released his iconic album {album: What's Going On}, one that is beloved by many critics and fans alike. This album marked a huge departure for Gaye, as most of his catalogue at the time had mostly consisted of love ballads and upbeat tracks. On {album: What's Going On}, Gaye wrote, and sang, about polarizing and controversial topics at the time, like {tag: racism}, the {tag: environment} and {tag: drugs}, themes that today seem more relevant than ever. He also wrote about his personal struggles, such as difficulties within his marriage and the heartbreaking death of his duet partner and close friend {artist: Tammi Terrell}.

Jim and Greg explore how legendary musicians from {artist: Eric Clapton} and {artist: Earl Hooker} to {name: Melvin "Wah-Wah" Ragin} and {name: Mikey Chung} used the pedal. They ultimately note that, despite getting a bad rap for being gimmicky, the wah-wah pedal plays a critical role in a number of genres of music.
