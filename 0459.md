# Show 459: James Brown Live at the Apollo and Opinions on New Pornographers & FKA Twigs
![work_web](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2014/jamesbrown_web.jpg)

As film audiences "Get On Up," {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} look back at James Brown's classic album {album: Live at the Apollo}. 

## 00:01:47 Classic Album Dissection: Live at the Apollo
![Live At the Apollo (1962)](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/459/2Z0.jpg)
Before he was {tag: America's Godfather of Soul}, {artist: James Brown} was the king of the {place: South}'s segregated "{place: Chitlin' Circuit}". It took {album: Live at the Apollo} - an album recorded over fifty years ago on Brown's own dime - to catapult him onto the national stage. With the success of the {artist: Mick Jagger}-produced biopic *{tag: Get On Up}*, we decided to revisit our {tag: Classic Album Dissection} of Brown's *Live at the Apollo* with help from music writer {name: RJ Smith}. He's the author of {tag: *The One: The Life and Music of James Brown*}. As RJ explains, James Brown was all about the live experience. He knew if radio listeners could just hear his live show, he could be "{name: Gary Coope}r big." He was right. High-energy numbers like "Night Train" and "Think" propelled Brown onto the {genre: pop} charts and super-charged his career. But, as Greg notes, *Live at the Apollo* wasn't just a turning point for Brown personally, it was a turning point for music. Suddenly {genre: doo-wop} and {genre: soul} was starting to sound...{genre: funk}y.


## 00:42:23 Review: New Pornographers
![Brill Bruisers](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/459/1YN0.jpg)
{artist: The New Pornographers}, a Canadian supergroup composed of folks like {artist: AC Newman}, {artist: Neko Case}, {artist: Dan Bejar} and more, have a new album out called {album: Brill Bruisers}. The band, which always relies heavily on melody and hooks, have amped it up even more according to {host: Greg}, making this album their most energetic to date. Greg loves the fact that {artist: AC Newman} shares the spotlight with {artist: Dan Bejar} and has almost every member leading a song. He says, no doubt, {tag: Buy It}. {host: Jim} agrees. He had been growing tired of {artist: The New Pornographers} because of all the many offshoot solo albums. But, he found himself really loving the uptempo nature of this album, particularly the keyboards of {artist: Blaine Thurier} and the singing of the band's unsung hero: {artist: Kathryn Calder}. It's hard to be a vocalist next to {artist: Neko Case}, but she more than holds her own and helps give this album a {tag: Buy It} rating from Jim.

## 00:49:34 Review: FKA Twigs
![LP1](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/459/2AM0.png)
{artist: FKA Twigs} is the debut album from {name: Tahliah Debrett Barnett}, an English singer-songwriter. Barnett started making music at 16, and at 17, she became a well-known backup dancer, appearing in videos by {artist: Kylie Minogue}, {artist: Ed Sheeran}, and {artist: Taio Cruz}. Her first album, {album: LP1}, has garnered a great deal of attention from the likes of {tag: Pitchfork} and {tag: The Fader} for its mix of {genre: avant-garde} soundscapes and {genre: R&B} vocals. {host: Greg} thinks this album is a grower, but what it's growing into is one of his favorites of 2014. He says {tag: Buy It}. {host: Jim} gave the album plenty of time to grow, and it really never kicked in. He calls {artist: FKA Twigs} a poor {artist: Kate Bush} imitation and complains about the music's lack of movement, emotion, soul and energy. Therefore, Jim says  {tag: Trash It}.
