# Show 495: Passion Pit & Opinions on Shamir

![passionpit](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2015/passionpit2_web.jpg)

{artist: Passion Pit} first broke through via MySpace with its danceable electronic sound. But beneath the bright synth-pop are often tortured lyrics about frontman {name: Michael Angelakos}’s struggle with manic depression. Angelakos joins {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} for a stripped-down performance and frank conversation about his illness. Then, they review the debut record from genre-defying singer {artist: Shamir}.

## 00:02:15 News: 05.22.15
The thrill, alas, is gone: {artist: B.B. King}, international ambassador for the {genre: blues}, has passed away at 89. Although the blues is associated with pain and heartbreak, King took great joy in his music, playing shows around the world non-stop until practically the day he died. King had a unique approach in which his voice was in a constant conversation with his legendary {tag: guitar,} {tag: Lucille}. That style was picked up by British {genre: blues-rock}ers like {artist: Eric Clapton} and {artist: Fleetwood Mac}'s {name: Peter Green}, and he influenced countless others after that. {host: Greg} thinks King's iconic sound was on display as early as 1951 on his song "{track: Three O'Clock Blues}," so he plays that recording in tribute to the great {place: Mississippi} bluesman.


## 00:06:49 Interview: Michael Angelakos
{genre: Indietronica} act {artist: Passion Pit} recently released its third album of {genre: electronic pop} {album: *Kindred*}, eliciting a {tag: Buy It} from both Jim and Greg. This week, we revisit our 2012 interview with Passion Pit frontman {name: Michael Angelakos}, who joined {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} in the studio for a frank conversation and stripped-back live set. Passion Pit first found success after Angelakos posted some songs on {tag: MySpace} in 2008 and the track "{track: Sleepyhead}" quickly exploded on the net. Passion Pit have since released three critically acclaimed albums and toured the world. The danceable tracks and high production values of the band's music can be deceptive. If you don't listen closely, you can miss the highly introspective lyrics that explore Angelakos's own experience with addiction and mental illness. As Michael tells Jim and Greg, the band had to cancel dates so that he could deal with issues related to his manic depression. The contrast between upbeat music and dark lyrics, Michael explains, is what he's always found interesting in {genre: pop} music, and it's the key to the Passion Pit project. Despite the often harrowing content, Michael says his music is ultimately hopeful – an effort to achieve transcendence amid tough circumstances.


## 00:43:36 Review: Shamir
![Ratchet](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/pf/us/r30/Music3/v4/76/14/21/76142128-6882-251d-747f-42b00d19c81f/cover.600x600-75.jpg "930149465/973351333")
{artist: Shamir} was first brought to our attention by the one and only Mr. {host: Greg Kot} as one of his favorite artists from this year's {tag: SXSW} in {place: Austin}. The 20-year-old singer defies categorization on his debut album {album: Ratchet} in so many ways: vocal style, presentation and sexuality. Jim and Greg both love the way he uses all the musical influences of his own past including country rock and brings in things like {genre: Chicago House}, which embraced pan sexuality and ambiguousness along with killer danceable hooks. Shamir really impressed {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} with this debut; he earns a double {tag: Buy It} rating.


## 00:50:13 DIJ: Greg
One of the best things about music is it can transport you to a whole other place without ever having to leave the room. {host: Greg}'s {tag: DIJ} pick this week is {artist: Marlena Shaw}'s 1969 track, "{track: California Soul}." The song was written by {name: Ashford & Simpson} and had been covered by {name: Marvin Gaye} and {name: Tammi Terrell} and {name: The 5th Dimension}. However Shaw's version is the most definitive, having been sampled numerous times over the years. Her cover combined elements of {genre: R&B}, {genre: soul}, {genre: jazz} and a hypnotizing string arrangement. While Shaw recorded the track in {place: Chicago}, it transports the listener straight to {place: California}.
