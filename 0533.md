# Show 533: Los Lobos

![Los Lobos](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2016/loslobos_web.jpg)

{artist: Los Lobos} has enjoyed a remarkable career for more than forty years, even retaining the same core lineup from its start as an {place: East Los Angeles} wedding band in 1973. Los Lobos joins hosts {host: Jim} DeRogatis and {host: Greg} Kot for a special interview and performance in front of a live audience.

## 00:02:13 Intro: Music News
{name: Maurice White}, founder of the great {genre: R&B} band {artist: Earth, Wind & Fire}, passed away on February 4 at the age of 74. White started in {place: Chicago} as a {genre: jazz} drummer, playing on {label: Chess Records} sessions by {artist: Willie Dixon} and {artist: Etta James} before being recruited into {artist: Ramsey Lewis}'s band. The crossover success of that gig allowed him to finance Earth, Wind & Fire, an extravagant showpiece band that could contain more than a dozen members – a flashy update of the big bands of the {genre: swing} era. {host: Greg} goes so far as to call White the "{artist: Duke Ellington} of R&B." Blending {genre: Latin} music, R&B, jazz, and {genre: African music}, Earth, Wind & Fire scored a string of hits in the 1970s. For Greg, the epitome of the band was the {era: 1975} song "{track: Shining Star}" which offered a uplifting message during a period of racial strife.

## 00:07:00 Interview: Los Lobos
Recently, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} were joined by an audience of Sound Opinions and {artist: Los Lobos} fans for a special recording at {place: City Winery Chicago}. {name: Louie Perez}, {name: David Hidalgo}, {name: Cesar Rosas}, {name: Conrad Lozano} and {name: Steve Berlin} showed everyone what it means to have 4 decades of chops and unity under their belts. Since forming in high school in {place: East L.A.}, Los Lobos has always pushed the boundaries of whatever genre they explored: rock, {genre: punk}, {tag: Mexican} {genre: folk}, {genre: R&B}, {genre: jazz}, {genre: psychedelia}. Most of that is a far cry from their huge 1987 hit "{track: La Bamba}." But, perhaps that cover got fans like {tag: Elmo} in the door. Now the group has a new album called {album: Gates of Gold}, its first release in 5 years. 

## 00:50:40 DIJ: Jim

For {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}, it's February in {place: Chicago}, and they couldn't think of a place they'd rather get away to than a warm desert island. This week it's Jim's turn, and he wants to take us back to the burgeoning {place: New York} {genre: punk} scene in the {era: 1970s}. Specifically, he wants to focus on {label: Ork Records}, a small independent label that served many underground punk bands. One such group that's a bit of a deep cut is the {tag: Susan Springfield}-led band, {artist: The Erasers}. Jim really digs this quartet, even though they only released one single and were never heard from again! However, the song "{track: I Won't Give Up}" is the perfect example of a great punk track that was ahead of its time.
