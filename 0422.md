# Show 422: The Dawn of Metal & Paramount Records

![Slayer](http://static.soundopinions.org/images/2013/dawnofmetal_web.jpg)

The Sound Opinions metal-themed holiday continues with a look back to the beginning: *The Dawn of Metal*. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} also discuss one of the most curious tales in {place: America}n music, {label: Paramount Records}. 

## 00:01:44 Interview: Dean and Scott Blackwood
One of the most curious stories in the history of American music is documented in a box set called {album: *The Rise and Fall of Paramount Records 1917-1927, Volume 1*}. The set includes 800 songs, 2 books, 6 vinyl LPs, 200 original hand drawn ads of the period, all housed in an oak case modeled after phonograph cases of the {era: 1920's}. This collection is produced by {artist: Jack White}'s {label: Third Man Records} & John Fahey's {label: Revenant Records}, and brothers {name: Scott [Blackwood]} and {name: Dean Blackwood} joined us to talk about the set which documents how a {place: Wisconsin} chair company, producing records on the cheap and run by men with little knowledge of the music business, built one of the greatest musical rosters ever assembled under one roof. {label: Paramount} had an amazing roster of performers including {artist: Louis Armstrong}, {artist: King Oliver}, {artist: Jelly Roll Morton}, {artist: Son House}, & {artist: Ma Rainey}.

## 00:21:22 Special: The Dawn of Metal
At this point in the show {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} take a trip back to *The Dawn of Metal*. {genre: Heavy Metal} isn't always taken seriously, but it warrants critical, even scholarly analysis. Before there was {artist: Metallica} or {artist: Guns N' Roses}, there was a group of rockers that birthed the genre. Jim and Greg trace the history, primarily back to {place: England} in the late {era: '60s}. Here are the bands the credit with giving us the metal we know and love today.

- {artist: Steppenwolf}
- {artist: Blue Cheer}
- {artist: Hawkwind}
- {artist: Led Zeppelin}
- {artist: Black Sabbath}
- {artist: Deep Purple}
- {artist: Uriah Heep}
- {artist: Judas Priest}
- {artist: Motörhead}

Fans of this early metal period will be happy to know that many of these bands are still rocking out [live](http://leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com/turn_it_up/2008/08/heaviest-metal.html).
