## 00:00:48 Review: Kendrick Lamar

![Kendrick Lamar Mr Morale & The Big Steppers](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/862/1C6.jpg)

{artist : Kendrick Lamar}'s new album “{album : Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers}” is his first new work since winning the Pulitzer Prize for his previous album, “Damn.” It is a sprawling double-album, but Lamar's idiosyncratic approach falls short of his previous work.

Florence Welch is a galvanizing performer and on “{album : Dance Fever}” {artist : Florence + The Machine} try to get listeners back on the dance floor following the pandemic periods of isolation. Her gender politics are embraced by both Jim and Greg, but Jim has trouble with her theatricality. Greg loves the new album.
