## 00:01:44 Special: 1977 - The Year Punk Broke
This week, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} kick off a two-part {tag: series} about one seminal year in rock history, {tag: 1977: The Year Punk Broke}. In this episode, they tackle the {genre: punk} explosion in the {place: U.K.} with help from music writer {name: Jon Savage}. (Many consider Savage's {tag: *England's Dreaming*} to be the definitive book on this period.) So what made punk explode in 1977? Jon chalks it up to a whole lot of rubbish pop music - songs like ABBA's "Fernando" and Elton John's "Don't Go Breaking My Heart" - that were marketed to kids but failed to address concerns about unemployment, consumerism, and of course, parents and other authority figures. More immediately, there was {artist: The Ramones} playing their first London gig, and inspiring bands from {artist: The Buzzcocks} to {artist: The Sex Pistols} to {artist: The Damned}. The Sex Pistols were the first to make a splash with their controversial single"{track: God Save the Queen}," banned across the British media. That {album: Never Mind the Bullocks, Here's the Sex Pistols} was still able to chart, Jon says, demonstrated the muscle of a nascent, independent youth media organized around fanzines and {tag: record shops} like {place: Rough Trade} and {place: Beggar's Banquet}. For those who think all U.K. punk sounded the same, Jon points out some key differences. While The Sex Pistols "really had a dark heart," {artist: The Clash} had the social consciousness of a sixties band. {place: Manchester}'s {artist: The Buzzcocks} were into psychedelia. Regardless of any one band's take on the genre however, punk's message was the same. In Jon's words: "Pop music doesn't have to be something that oppresses you. It can actually liberate you."

Jim and Greg close out 1977 Part One by playing two favorite songs from this year. {host: Greg} goes out with {artist: The Adverts}' "{track: One Chord Wonder}." Not only did The Adverts have the best names in punk - T.V. Advert, Gaye Advert, Howard Pickup, and Laurie Driver - they epitomized the genre's "no skill required" ethos. {host: Jim} goes with the {artist: Wire} track "{track: Ex-Lion Tamer}" from one of his favorite records of all time, {album: Pink Flag}. This quartet of art students not only embodied the punk sound in 1977, they were also looking forward to the possibilities of post-punk.

## 00:49:39 Review: Redd Kross
![Researching the Blues (Bonus Track Version)](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/5e/a0/f9/5ea0f91c-ed98-158f-97f2-126ad4750509/454_reddkross_mini_900px.jpg/600x600bb-85.jpg "5893797/536285982")

Jim and Greg review {album: Researching the Blues}, the new record from {place: California} {genre: rock} veterans {artist: Redd Kross}. Adopted as the "little brothers" of L.A.'s hardcore punk scene when they first formed in 1980, Redd Kross always tended more Beach Boys than Black Flag in sound. Their {era: 1990} record {album: Third Eye} was a harbinger of later alt-era successes (Nevermind for one), but the band itself never achieved {artist: Nirvana}-level success and went on hiatus in 1997. {album: Researching the Blues}, the band's first new record in 15 years, reunites the "classic lineup" of {name: Jeff McDonald}, {name: Steve McDonald}, {name: Robert Hecker}, and {name: Roy McDonald}. Both {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} agree they're glad to have these boys back. {artist: Redd Kross} have cut all the fat, Greg says. They get in, give you a great guitar solo and some killer harmonies, and then get out. Past records have been rife with {era: seventies} pop-culture references. Greg thinks {artist: Redd Kross} are taking themselves a bit more seriously this time around, though Jim points out there are still enough kitschy references to Dracula and Frankenstein to keep things light. Researching the Blues gets a double {tag: Buy It}.
