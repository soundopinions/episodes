This week, {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} talk to TV personality {name : Ari Melber}. Melber, who began his career as an attorney, is the host of {tag : The Beat} on {tag : MSNBC}, a show where he unpacks the day's news, and sometimes that involves integrating rap lyrics to help explain the stories. They talk about his love for {genre : rap} music, how much he prepares for his show and the similarities between {genre : hip hop} and the {tag : White House} today.



## 00:45:45 DIJ: Greg

A band {host : Greg} highlighted earlier in the show, {artist : The Soft Science}, released a cover of {artist : The House of Love}'s 1989 single "{track : I Don't Know Why I Love You}" as a B-side in April. For this spin on the {tag : Desert Island Jukebox}, Greg's playing the original. He says that {artist : The House of Love} was a victim of bad timing, coming after {artist : The Smiths}, but before the {genre : Britpop} boom. The song "{track : I Don't Know Why I Love You}" came on their second self-titled album. That session was their first for a major label and took more than two years and four producers to complete. Band members said new pressure to create hits caused tension within the band. The album's first single and some remixes were released against the band's will, adding to the trouble. Eventually guitarist {name : Terry Bickers} was kicked out of the band just a few days into the album's promotional tour. Still, {host : Greg} says the album is full of singles that hold up, even almost 30 years later. He points out similarities in the sound of {artist : Ride} and {artist : The Stone Roses} as evidence of {artist : The House of Love}'s influence.
