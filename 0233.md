# Show 233: The xx & Opinions on The Dead Weather

## 00:01:52 News: 5.14.2010
{album: Exile on Main Street} is widely considered {artist: The Rolling Stones}' best album and one of the best albums of all time. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} would agree. So, it's no surprise that fans have been clamoring for even the smallest extra bit of insight into the making of the record. Unfortunately, the new *Exile* {tag: reissue} does not deliver that. It comes with a deluxe edition of the album, bonus tracks, a documentary DVD and a book, but nothing that would allow a fan to penetrate the mysterious, drug-filled recording sessions. It's merely a big tease, say Jim and Greg, and nothing approaching the successful model of reissues established by {album: Pet Sounds} and {album: Funhouse}.

## 00:08:21 Interview: The xx
![The xx](http://static.soundopinions.org/images/2010/thexx/thexx.jpg)
This week's guests are {artist: The xx}. The young {place: British} band released their self-titled debut last year, and it went on to make {host: Greg}'s list of top albums of 2009 ([Listen here](/show/211/)). Since then their music has appeared in a number of major television shows and ads, and they're playing {place: Lollapalooza}. The group is known for their intimate, call and response soundâ€“one that emerged more out of necessity than art. {tag: Bassist} and {tag: vocalist} {name: Oliver Sim} explains that neither he nor {name: Romy Madley Croft} were confident to sing on their own. But Romy assures us that there's nothing romantic about their intimacy. The two have been friends since they were small children. 

## 00:42:52 Review: The Dead Weather
![Sea of Cowards](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/f0/3e/23/f03e23f3-290d-35f4-fa5a-c0df65a2cd95/source/600x600bb.jpg "307168816/364908824")
{name: Jack White} might be the new hardest-working man in show business. Not only does he front his original band {artist: The White Stripes}, but he's a member of {artist: The Raconteurs} and most recently {artist: The Dead Weather}. That group just released its second album in less than a year called {album: Sea of Cowards}. White is joined by {name: Alison Mosshart} from {artist: The Kills} on {tag: vocals} and {name: Dean Fertita} from {artist: Queens of the Stone Age}. But, as Greg explains, it's White's stamp that's all over this record. He does the songwriting and production. {host: Jim} hears a lot of enthusiasm in the music, and it holds together more as a project than the self-titled debut. He compares White to {name: Nick Cave} -- the music is dangerous and enticing and gets a {tag: Buy It} rating. {host: Greg} can't believe Jim would compare White to Cave -- he doesn't think he has nearly the same songwriting chops. And the songwriting is where *Sea of Cowards* falls off for Greg. He loves the attitude and sound, but thinks the songs are fragments at best. It gets a {tag: Try It}.

## 00:49:22 DIJ: Jim
During {artist: The xx} interview, the band spoke of their admiration for {artist: Aaliyah}. This got {host: Jim} thinking about the {genre: R&B} {tag: singer}, who died in 2001. As he says, she wasn't the greatest singer, she wasn't the most original, but she had real charisma and star power. He adds the track {track: Rock the Boat}, from {album: Aaliyah}'s third and final self-titled album.
