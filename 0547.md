# Show 547: Riot Grrrl at 25 & Opinions on Radiohead & Drake

![Bikini Kill](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2016/riotgrrrl25_web.jpg)

While the {place: Seattle} {genre: grunge} bands had the commercial success, the {place: Pacific Northwest}'s {genre: Riot Grrrl} scene had an equally important legacy. Jim and Greg look back at {tag: feminist} {genre: punk} movement 25 years on. Then they review the new albums from {artist: Drake} and {artist: Radiohead}.

## 00:01:49 Intro: Music News

Last weekend was the famous {tag: Eurovision} Song Contest, the "World Cup" of music. A fixture in Europe since 1968, past winners include {artist: ABBA}, {artist: Celine Dion} and {artist: Katrina and the Waves}. Eurovision never fails to feature weird music and geopolitical controversy, and this year was no exception. Singer {artist: Jamala} from {place: Ukraine} beat out {place: Australia} and {place: Russia} for the top prize. Russia was irked by Jamala's song choice, a track called "{track: 1944}," about {name: Stalin}'s exile of the {place: Crimea}n {tag: Tatar} population – with obvious connections to today's crisis in Ukraine. Better the countries fight via silly pop songs than actual guns, {host: Jim} argues.

Get your sunscreen, hats, and wallets out for the first {tag: Desert Trip}! The new music festival will be held in the same location as {tag: Coachella}, and with its septuagenarian lineup, it quickly acquired the nickname "{tag: Oldchella}." Desert Trip will feature six major acts from the {era: 1960s} {genre: rock} scene: {artist: The Rolling Stones}, {artist: Bob Dylan}, {artist: Paul McCartney}, {artist: Neil Young}, {artist: Roger Waters} and {artist: The Who}. Ticket sales have already exceeded a record $150 million – thanks to ticket prices reaching into the thousands. That's not to mention the $6,500 resort packages. Jim thinks that for that price, they ought to air condition the desert.


## 00:08:35 Genre Dissection: Riot Grrrl

Let's get ready to riot! This week, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} celebrate the 25th anniversary of the underground feminist {genre: punk} movement, {genre: Riot Grrrl}. It all began in the early {era: '90s} in {place: Washington, D.C.} and the {place: Pacific Northwest} when women united in outrage by speaking out on issues like domestic abuse, reproductive rights, sexual harassment and rape. They conveyed their messages through loud, confrontational punk music, a genre that was notoriously male-dominated. 

Jim and Greg revisit an interview from 2011 with {name: Sara Marcus}, author of {tag: *Girls to the Front: The True Story of the Riot Grrrl Revolution*}. Sara shares the history of the movement as well as her quintessential Riot Grrrl recordings:

- {artist: Bikini Kill}, {album: The C.D. Version of the First Two Records}
- {artist: Bikini Kill}, {album: New Radio 7"}
- {artist: Bratmobile}, {album: Pottymouth}
- {artist: Heavens to Betsy}, {album: These Monsters Are Real 7"}
- {artist: Huggy Bear}, {album: Taking the Rough with the Smooch}

Though the initial Riot Grrrl movement came and went quickly, it produced a legion of musicians who continue to produce powerful music. To cap off the show, Greg and Jim play songs by two bands rooted in the Riot Grrrl movement. Greg chooses {track: I Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone} by {artist: Sleater-Kinney}. Sleater-Kinney was founded by {name: Corin Tucker}, of the Riot Grrrl band Heavens to Betsy and {name: Carrie Brownstein} of the queercore band {artist: Excuse 17}. Jim goes with {track: Hot Topic} by {artist: Le Tigre}, {name: Kathleen Hanna}'s second band after Bikini Kill. 


## 00:39:23 Review: Radiohead
![A Moon Shaped Pool](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/547/1TN0.jpg)

If there's one band from the {era: '90s} {genre: alt-rock} explosion that's retained its relevance, it's {artist: Radiohead}. While it's been five years since their last release, {host: Greg} argues that the quality hasn't suffered on their new album {album: A Moon Shaped Pool}. Multi-instrumentalist {name: Jonny Greenwood} seems to have integrated everything he's learned about scoring films into the album. The musical arrangements lift vocalist {name: Thom Yorke} to new heights as he contemplates everything from breakups to the {tag: environment}. Greg got lost inside the record and its ideas of transformation.  It took {host: Jim} a bit longer to dig what was inside. He laments the under-use of drummer {name: Phil Selway}, and the lack of a real fist-pumping save-the-planet anthem. But Jim knows to review what you get, not what you want – and he hears a complex and beautiful {genre: chamber pop} record reminiscent of {artist: Nick Drake}. That earns {album: A Moon Shaped Pool} an enthusiastic double-{tag: Buy It}. 


## 00:45:59 Review: Drake
![Views](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/547/24N0.jpg)

After much anticipation, {genre: rap}per {artist: Drake} has finally released his fourth album, {album: Views}. Over the past six years, the {tag: Canadian} artist has risen to the top of the commerical rap genre, releasing four albums and several mixtapes, all of which have gone platinum. {host: Jim} takes issue with the album's subject matter, with Drake frequently complaining about the perks of his superstardom. Aside from that, he thinks Drake has yet to take his {album: 808s & Heartbreak}-inspired music to another level, something contemporaries {artist: The Weeknd} and {artist: Frank Ocean} have managed successfully. {host: Greg} agrees, though he acknowledges that Drake's earlier material was pretty effective. Ultimately, Greg thinks we've already heard this Drake album and he's capable of more. That's a double {tag: Trash It} for *Views*.
