## 00:01:50 News: 2.1.2013
Guitarist and {artist: Ohio Players} frontman {name: Leroy "Sugarfoot" Bonner} died of undisclosed causes this week at the age of 69. The group's string of {era: '70s} albums for {label: Westbound} and {label: Mercury Records}, driven by Bonner's lead vocals and electrifying double-neck guitar work, stands as one of the most impressive runs in {genre: funk} history. Their distinct sound found new life in the in the late {era: '80s} and {era: '90s} as countless {genre: hip hop} artists sampled the group's work (a {artist: Red Hot Chili Peppers} cover of "{track: Love Rollercoaster}" on the soundtrack for {tag: *Beavis and Butthead Do America*} didn't hurt either). {host: Greg} highlights "{track: Skin Tight}" as a prime example of Bonner's musical legacy.

## 00:06:04 Interview: The db's
This week {artist: the dB's}, one of power {genre: pop}'s great underexposed bands, stops by the Sound Opinions studio for an interview and live set. The group came together in 1978 as part of {place: New York City}'s {genre: punk} and {genre: new wave} scene, and put out two classic, but minimally distributed albums before singer/guitarist {name: Chris Stamey} left the group. Two more low profile records followed before the group broke up in 1988. Now the original dB's lineup is back with a new album, {album: Falling Off the Sky}. {host: Jim} used to frequently go see this band live in their earliest days, and it's clear that they haven't lost a step in their few decades off. During their visit, the band rips through three songs from {album: Falling Off the Sky}, and Stamey and co-frontman {name: Peter Holsapple} talk with Jim and {host: Greg} about their early days in {place: North Carolina}, their label woes in the {era: '80s}, and their decision to reunite not for a paycheck, but just because they were itching to play again. 

## 00:44:19 Review: Solange
![True](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music69/v4/4e/f5/e6/4ef5e655-1006-841b-65ef-3a509eaa163f/source/600x600bb.jpg "927803/1083759891")

{name: Beyonce} has been making a lot of news, with her lip-syncing and Superbowling, but we're more interested in kid sis {artist: Solange}. She has a new extended EP out called {album: True}, and both {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} say it's a perfect, mini release. She sounds nothing like Beyonce and has been embracing {genre: alt-R&B} and {genre: indie rock}-exactly what you expect from someone who dragged her brother-in-law to a {artist: Grizzly Bear} show. Greg is excited to hear her expand her sound even more on a full-length album. And Jim compares True to the {name: Scorcese} flick {tag: *After Hours*}. Solange gets a double {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:50:42 DIJ: Greg
Greg's been in a {artist: Joni Mitchell} phase, and is particularly smitten with the singer/songwriter's 1976 release {album: For the Roses}. Between her {genre: folk} phase and her {genre: avant-jazz} phase, she released this record with the track {track: "You Turn Me On, I'm a Radio"}. Is it directed towards a romantic figure? Or a record company one? Add that question to the layers of sounds and influences from {genre: country} to {genre: Latin} to {genre: jazz}, and you've got one wonderfully complicated song.
