# Show 374: Trey Parker and Matt Stone & Reviews of New Order and Parquet Courts
{name: Trey Parker} and {name: Matt Stone} - the creative minds behind {tag: South Park} and {tag: The Book of Mormon} - discuss the intersection between music and comedy. Plus, a review of new albums by {artist: New Order} and {artist: Parquet Courts}.

## 00:01:49 News: 01.25.2013
{name: Justin Timberlake} played a social-media mogul in the movies, but can he do it in real-life? The JT-backed social media site {tag: MySpace} recently re-launched with a sleeker design and a 50 million-plus song library. The company says it's the internet's largest legally streamable song library. Or is it? A group representing indie labels like {label: Merge}, {label: Domino}, and {label: Beggar's Group} is alleging that MySpace has its members' music up without permission. Will MySpace be able to work out a deal? Given the site's 27 million unique visitors a month, {host: Greg}'s betting the indie labels will find a way to compromise.

{host: Jim} always suspected {genre: rock 'n' roll} was a hazardous occupation. Now experts at Britain's Health Department have weighed in, and guess what? It's true. A study of 1,500 artists across genres concludes that 9.2 percent of rockers die earlier than regular folks. Not only that, but solo artists face twice the death-risk of artists in bands. Researchers speculated that bands provide an extra support network for at-risk stars. Turns out we really do get by with a little help from our friends.

## 00:07:38 Interview: Trey Parker and Matt Stone
It's time to "{track: Man Up}" for a visit from {name: Trey Parker} and {name: Matt Stone}. They are the dynamic duo behind {tag: *South Park*} and the hit {tag: Broadway} musical {tag: The Book of Mormon}. "What are they doing on our rock and roll show?" you ask. Well, some of the greatest moments of satire (see last week's show)  on *South Park* are musical. In fact, check out our favorites [here](http://soundopinions.tumblr.com/post/41362994603/top-5-musical-moments-from-south-park).

Plus, you could argue the show itself is quite punk rock with it's no holds barred attitude and {genre: lo-fi} animation. The show even spawned a {name: Rick Rubin}-produced album. Now we have an equally outrageous musical, The Book of Mormon. It tells the story of two {tag: Mormon} missionaries sent to a remote village in northern {place: Uganda}. It's even "bluer" than *South Park*, but despite this, or
 perhaps because of it, it's a smash hit. Trey, Matt and collaborator {name: Robert Lopez} have won a slew of {tag: Tony Awards} and a record-breaking slot on the {tag: Billboard} chart. So, how'd two {artist: Ween}, {artist: Primus} and {genre: Prog Rock} fans from {place: Colorado} end up the toast of {tag: Broadway}? Trey and Matt explained this and their songwriting philosophy during their visit to our studios. They were in town for the {place: Chicago} opening of the play.

## 00:40:24 Review: New Order
![Lost Sirens](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9a/New_Order_-_Lost_Sirens.png "176722/586305449")
At the beginning of the {artist: New Order} review, Greg calls the English band's latest album {album: Lost Sirens} almost a collection of "leftovers." That can't bode too well for it. New Order's music in the {era: 1980's} was undeniably influential. There'd be no {artist: LCD Soundsystem} or {artist: Radiohead} without their {genre: electronic} {genre: pop} innovations. But, {host: Jim} doesn't hear anything that evokes their {tag: Madchester} [greatness](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2PYyvGFHD8) on this effort. He says {tag: Trash It}. {host: Greg} really liked the tracks "{track: I Told You So}" and "{track: Hellbent}", so that bumps up his rating to a {tag: Try It}.

## 00:48:23 Review: Parquet Courts
![Light Up Gold / Tally All the Things That You Broke](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music69/v4/25/38/0a/25380a0d-a09a-2c15-0133-82d61878fbd8/source/600x600bb.jpg "570708990/1068649805")
Who knew {place: Denton, TX} was a rock capital? There's {artist: Midlake} and {artist: Neon Indian}. {name: Sly Stone} was born there! And now we have {artist: Parquet Courts}. With its 2nd release {album: Light Up Gold}, the {genre: garage} quartet has relocated to {place: Brooklyn} and is getting much wider attention. The album is a perfect combination of expert {genre: pop} craftsmanship and slacker-{genre: punk} attitude. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} grinned through this review, so Parquet Courts gets a double {tag: Buy It}.
