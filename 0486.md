# Show 486: Jac Holzman on Elektra Records and Opinions on Cannibal Ox

![jacholzman](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2015/jacholzman_web.jpg)

{host : Jim} and {host : Greg} talk about the birth of rock 'n' roll and the modern label system with {label : Elektra Records} founder {name : Jac Holzman}. Later in the show, they review the new long-awaited album by {artist : Cannibal Ox}.



## 00:02:15 Intro: Music News

Recently {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} saw a flurry of stories in the "People Will Buy Anything" department. {name : John Lennon}'s Gretsch 6120 guitar, which he used to record {artist : The Beatles}' classic "{track : Paperback Writer}," was sold to {tag : Indianapolis Colts} owner {name : Jim Irsay} for $530,000. And that's not the only famous guitar up for purchase: {name : Rick Nielsen} of {artist : Cheap Trick} is starting to auction off some pieces from his massive collection of vintage axes. Some of his guitars have reached prices as high as $8,500.

Meanwhile, the secret buyer of {artist : Elvis Presley}'s very first recording has been revealed, and it's none other than {artist : Jack White}. The {tag : Third Man Records} honcho paid $300,000 for the 1953 acetate of "{track : My Happiness}"/"{track : That's When Your Heartaches Begin}" and plans to reissue it on vinyl for {tag : Record Store Day}.

Those all may sound like worthwhile purchases, if you've got the cash. But the same can't be said for some other pieces of music memorobilia showing up on the auction block. A plastic bag allegedly full of air from a {artist : Kanye West} concert reached bids of over $60,000 before {tag : eBay} shut down the auction. Many copycat listings have followed, including a bag of Ye's flatulence for the bargain price of $5.



## 00:06:32 Interview: Jac Holzman on Elektra Records

![jacholzman](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/486/AW0.jpg)

Before there was a {label : Merge [Records]} or a {label : Matador [Records]} there was {label : Elektra Records}. The great {place : America}n label is celebrating its 65th anniversary, and so {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} return to their conversation with Elektra founder {name : Jac Holzman}. They spoke with him in 2011 when he was being into the {tag : Rock and Roll Hall of Fam}e. Jac talks about launching Elektra as an independent folk label out of his dorm room in {era : 1950}. Eventually the roster grew to include every genre of music – blues, rock, funk, world and pop. It became the home to {artist : The Stooges}, {artist : the MC5}, {artist : Love} and {artist : Queen}, and, Jim adds, some notoriously difficult personalities. But Jac insists no artist was too hard to handle. He did use caution when out drinking with {name : Jim Morrison}, however.



## 00:41:24 Review: Cannibal Ox

![Blade of the Ronin](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/486/1X00.jpg)

Back in {era : 2001}, {artist : Cannibal Ox} put out one of the best {genre : rap} albums of the decade called {album : The Cold Vein}. It was produced by {artist : Run the Jewels} rapper and recent Sound Opinions guest, {artist : El-P}. Since then, Ox members {artist : Vast Aire} and {artist : Vordul Mega} embarked on lukewarm solo careers. But now they are back for the group's second album, {album : Blade of the Ronin}. For {host : Jim}, the two MCs are better together than they are apart. The album has elements of {tag : psychedelia} and {artist : Wu-Tang Clan}'s style, but for Jim it feels old. It's not as good as {album : Run the Jewels} but better than most, so he gives it a {tag : Try It}. {host : Greg} is a huge fan of the duo, but thinks that the merger of futurism, sci-fi and ancient {place : Egypt} is nothing new. While he enjoys the record, it's no classic. Greg also says {tag : Try It}.



## 00:49:02 DIJ: Jim

We really do read your letters! After we first aired our interview with {name : Jac Holzman}, a listener wrote in saying he'd like to hear more about {name : Paul Butterfield}. So in response, Jim drops a track by {artist : The Paul Butterfield Blues Band} into the {tag : Desert Island Jukebox}. In {era : 1966}, on an album of the same name, the group recorded the song "{track : East-West}" written by guitarist/composer {name : Mike Bloomfield}. Bloomfield was influenced by {genre : blues}, {genre : psychedelia}, {genre : free jazz} and {place : India}n {genre : raga} music. This track in turninfluenced everyone from the {artist : Grateful Dead} to {name : Joe Boyd}. It's a landmark in rock, and it's goin' with {host : Jim} to the island.
