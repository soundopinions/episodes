## 00:00:00 Obituaries: Clem Burke and Dave Allen

Jim and Greg pay tribute to Blondie drummer Clem Burke and Gang of Four bassist Dave Allen, who both recently died. 

## Review: Lucy Dacus

{artist : Lucy Dacus} has just released “{album : Forever is a Feeling},” her first album for a major label- and her first after Boygenius’ breakthrough success. It features guest appearances from Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers, Hozier and Bartees Strange. 

## Review: Saba and No I.D.
{artist : Saba} and {artist : No ID} have released their collaborative album, “{album : From The Private Collection of…}” after years of anticipation. Saba came up years after No ID, but the pair have found common ground and produced a love letter to Chicago’s classic hip hop sound.
 
## Review: Perfume Genius

{artist : Perfume Genius} is back with “{album : Glory},” a strong album that caused Jim to reconsider his opinion of the band’s previous album. Greg praises the vulnerability that comes through in the lyrics.

## Review: The Mekons

{artist : The Mekons} are “the last punk band standing” and are back with “{album : Horror},” their first album in five years. Despite Jim’s distaste for “sea shanties” he praises the effort. Greg thinks it contains some of the group’s greatest moments.
