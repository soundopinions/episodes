# Show 234: The Rock Doctors Battle Addiction & Opinions on The National and Janelle Monáe
{tag: Rock Doctors} {host: Jim DeRogatis} and {host: Greg Kot} conduct their first rock and roll intervention. They help a listener with a musical addiction...before it's too late. Plus Jim and Greg review new albums from {artist: The National} and {artist: Janelle Monáe}.

## 00:01:53 Intro: Music News
{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} start the show by wishing {tag: YouTube} a happy 5th birthday. The internet video site marked the occasion by announcing that it now gets more than 2 billion hits daily. It's doing better than all 3 major television networks. And viral phenoms {artist: Justin Bieber} and {artist: Greyson Chance} will certainly want to extend their congratulations to YouTube. Unfortunately our personal favorite has yet to score that major record deal. 

Last week {tag: LimeWire} was found guilty of {tag: copyright infringement} last week in a {place: New York} court. This was the first case targeting a file-sharing software maker following the 2005 {tag: Grokster} decision, in which the {tag: U.S. Supreme Court} cleared the way for lawsuits targeting companies that induced or encouraged file-sharing piracy. It's a huge victory for the "content industry," but as Greg explains, LimeWire has a lot of resources–we shouldn't count them out yet.

Next Jim and Greg bid farewell to metal icon {artist: Ronnie James Dio}. He {tag: died} this week at age {tag: 67}. Dio fronted a number of major metal bands, including the second incarnation of {artist: Black Sabbath}. Fans may also remember him from {tag: *Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny*}, and he is sometimes credited with popularizing the rock "devil's horns" gesture. He'll be missed by many a metal fan.

## 00:13:00 Rock Doctors: Phish Addict
![phish](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/234/LO0.jpg)
A few times a year {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} take off their critics' hats and put on their doctors' coats. They talk to listeners in need of a dose of new music or musical therapy. Today, they respond to an urgent plea from {name: Katie} in {place: Atlanta}. She filled out our patient form on behalf of her fiancé {name: Daniel}. According to Katie, Daniel is addicted to {artist: Phish}. She admires his passion for the jam band, but wishes he'd expand his listening palette more. Plus, following a forever-touring band can be time-consuming and expensive–especially when planning a wedding.
The Rock Doctors conduct their musical intervention for Daniel. He doesn't think "addiction" is a fair description for his relationship to Phish, but he's wiling to take his medicine and try some new music. 

Dr. DeRogatis gives the first prescription: {artist: Minus the Bear}. He thinks Daniel will appreciate their musical experimentation and skill. Daniel spends a week with their new album {album: Omni} and reports back with positive results. He loves the lead singer's voice, and the group's production. 

Dr. Kot prescribes {artist: Dan Deacon}'s record {album: Bromst}. He hopes Daniel will hear Deacon's impressive classical training. Unfortunately, this medicine didn't go down as smoothly. Daniel is confident that Deacon live would be a great experience, but the music was too out there for him.

## 00:40:41 Review: The National
![High Violet (Expanded Edition)](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/234/1VT0.jpg)
{place: Brooklyn} rockers {artist: The National} released their fifth album called {album: High Violet}. Greg has been a champion of the band and its melancholic sound from the beginning. He's a "sucker" for their Joy Division-meets-Leonard Cohen songs. However, he wished they'd gone somewhere new on this album. *High Violet* is merely a refinement of what The National had done before, so {host: Greg} can only give it a {tag: Try It} rating. {host: Jim} thinks {name: Matt Berninger}'s lyrics of heartache are as original as ever. It's not groundbreaking, he admits, but it's a {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:47:36 Review: Janelle Monáe
![The ArchAndroid (Deluxe)](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/234/27C0.jpg)
On the other end of the rock spectrum is {artist: Janelle Monáe}. The {tag: alternative} {genre: R&B} singer's debut album is called {album: The ArchAndroid}. It's a dense science fiction concept record that incorporates {genre: hip hop}, {genre: soul}, {genre: funk}, {genre: rock} and {genre: big band }sounds. {host: Jim} hears the most ambition from an R&B singer in a long time. He loves {name: [Janelle] Monáe}'s universe and gives The ArchAndroid a {tag: Buy It}. {host: Greg} goes even further, calling this record the best he's heard this year. Spend time with it and you will love it. The ArchAndroid gets a double {tag: Buy It}.
