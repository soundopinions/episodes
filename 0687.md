## 00:34:05 Interview: The O'My's

Recently, Jim and Greg sat down with a band that Greg highlighted as a {tag: Buried Treasure} last year: {artist: The O'My's}. The genre-bending {genre: soul} duo have become a fixture in {place: Chicago}'s music scene, collaborating with rappers like {artist: Chance The Rapper}, {artist: Saba}, and {artist: Vic Mensa}. They've also worked with producer and horn player {artist: Nico Segal}, who previously recorded as {artist: Donnie Trumpet}. The group started out stylistically indebted to their soul predecessors (down to wearing suits on stage); but with their latest album, 2018's {album: Tomorrow}, their sound has developed into something thoroughly modern.
The O'My's, made up of singer/guitarist {artist: Maceo Haymes} and keyboardist {artist: Nick Hennessey}, joined us for a stripped down performance and conversation at the {tag: Goose Island Tap Room}.
