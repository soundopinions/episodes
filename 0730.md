# Show 730: Songs That Make You Cry, Opinions on The Replacements & FKA twigs

![cry](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2019/cry.png)

For one reason or another, everyone has got a handful of songs that make them {tag: cry}. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} share some of the songs that bring {tag: tears} to their eyes. They also review something old and something new: they revisit {artist: The Replacements}' album {album: Don't Tell a Soul} 30 years later and share their thoughts on the new record from {artist: FKA twigs}.

## 00:01:21 Review: The Replacements
![Dead Man's Pop](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2019/replacements1.jpg)

Legendarily shambolic, {artist: The Replacements} were a great band often a few years ahead of its time. Their 1989 album, {album: Don't Tell A Soul}, attempted to polish up their sound in hopes of gaining radio airplay and commercial success, a far-fetched aspiration in retrospect. Still, {label: Sire Records} saw enough potential to scrap the original mix the band wanted in favor of a more polished radio-friendly version. The album wound up going nowhere commercially, though just two years later, things may have been different post-{album: Nevermind}. Mats fans have speculated ever since what would have happened had the original mix been released. The box set {album: Dead Man's Pop} provides a genuine article to fuel that speculation. Original producer {name: Matt Wallace} has remixed Don't Tell A Soul to capture the sound the band actually wanted back in 1989. The set also includes a session The Replacements recorded with {artist: Tom Waits} around this time, as well as a complete live show. 

{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} agree that the production wasn't the only problem with Don't Tell A Soul, so Dead Man's Pop can only improve things so much. Greg finds that the new mixes reveal an inspiration he hadn't previously associated with the album: {artist: Rod Stewart}'s 1971 acoustic-electric album {album: Every Picture Tells A Story}. Jim is most appreciative of the concert recording that's included in the box set.


##  00:07:41 Review: FKA twigs

{host: Greg} says that British avant {genre: electronic} artist {artist: FKA twigs} named her sophomore effort {album: MAGDALENE} after the biblical Mary Magdalene, a woman in The Bible who was "…miscast as a sex worker by a Pope. People don't realize that she was basically another disciple, and one of the greatest advocates of Jesus Christ's teachings in the Bible." Greg adds that to FKA twigs, Mary Magdalene represents all women "who have ever felt misunderstood, demeaned, mischaracterized… basically all women throughout history." MAGDALENE features her sweet soprano voice contrasting with what Greg terms "crunchy production... This record is {genre: art-pop} to the max." He compares her style to {artist: Kate Bush}. {host: Jim} agrees, but adds that FKA's genre-hopping also reminds him of {artist: Bjork} at her best, and can be seen as a companion piece to {artist: Lana Del Rey}'s {album: Norman F *#$%&$ Rockwell}. But beyond the comparisons, Jim asserts that FKA Twigs has "a personality all her own, commenting on where romance fits in her life [and] where women fit in the world at this moment," adding "it's a really smart, and very gripping record."

##  00:46:31 DIJ: Greg
{host: Greg} puts another coin into the Desert Island Jukebox, this time in appreciation of "{track: Let Me In}" from {artist: R.E.M.}'s much maligned {era: 1994} album {album: Monster}. Greg argues that despite the album's bad reputation, the track is "a beautiful mourning song" written by {artist: Michael Stipe} in the wake of the deaths of his friends {name: River Phoenix} and {artist: Kurt Cobain} (who died within six months of each other.)
