# Show 410: Fall Record Reviews & Jim's DIJ
![Fall Record Reviews](http://static.soundopinions.org/images/reviews/purpleturntable.jpg)

Hosts Jim DeRogatis and Greg Kot get critical with five new record releases from the likes of Justin Timberlake, Elvis Costello, Franz Ferdinand, The Weeknd and HAIM.

## 00:01:49 News: 10-4-2013
{place: North Carolina} Congressman {name: Melvin Watt} has introduced a bill that promises to shake up the radio world. Known as the "{tag: Free Market Royalty Act}," it would require broadcasters—online and offline alike—to compensate artists and labels whose music they play. (Under the current rules, only the songwriter and rights holder receive the royalties, and terrestrial radio stations get a free ride.) While artists have come out in support of the bill, {tag: The National Association of Broadcasters} — the {place: U.S.} radio industry's lobbying arm—is making its opposition known, warning that this "performance tax" would burden already-struggling radio stations.

Over on the charts, a string of debuts took top slots. {artist: Drake}'s new album {album: Nothing Was the Same} exploded at number one, making it the second best-selling debut week for any artist in 2013 (topped only by {artist: Justin Timberlake}). And, for the second week running, {artist: Miley Cyrus}' "Wrecking Ball" is number one on {tag: Billboard's Hot 100}… but is it [really](http://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2013/09/30/227792724/is-miley-cyrus-s-wrecking-ball-a-hit-for-real)? In February, {tag: Billboard} began including digital streaming in its tally for the [Hot 100](http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/5740625/ask-billboard-how-does-the-hot-100-work). So, Miley has {tag: YouTube} to thank for her success.

In other weird charts news, the finale of AMC's smash hit *{tag: Breaking Bad}* aired last week, and it closed with the forgotten {artist: Badfinger} track "{track: Baby Blue}." Hours after the final credits rolled, 5,000 fans had purchased the {era: 1972} song on {tag: iTunes}, and its {tag: Spotify} streams skyrocketed by 9,000%. {host: Greg} thought it was a good song choice, but {host: Jim} says that he would have preferred {artist: Bob Dylan}'s "{track: It's All Over Now, Baby Blue}." (Hey, at least it wasn't as painful as {tag: The Sopranos} farcical "{track: Don't Stop Believin'}."

{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} invite you to **"{tag: Ask the Critic}."** This week they answer a question from Kevin, a 15-year-old fan from {place: Chicago}. Kevin seeks advice on starting a band. Jim and Greg tell him to play from the heart…never mind those stinkin' critics! Got a question for Jim and Greg? Email interact@soundopinions.org or call 888.859.1800.

## 00:12:48 Review: Justin Timberlake
![The 20/20 Experience – 2 of 2](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music4/v4/10/7f/08/107f082e-1b1a-5773-2c97-22ca26453df1/source/600x600bb.jpg "398128/672487211")

This fall is seeing a slew of big new records. First up to bat is {artist: Justin Timberlake} with {album: The 20/20 Experience 2 of 2}. The triple threat has teamed up with one of the {tag: producer}s who helped him make his post-{artist: N'Sync} debut: {name: Timbaland}. But, this time the results are mixed. {host: Jim} finds the music lacking punch and wishes the {tag: BPM}'s were upped a bit. He says {tag: Trash It}. {host: Greg} [agrees](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-09-30/entertainment/chi-justin-timberlake-review-20130929_1_20-20-experience-wallrdquo-producer-timbaland) the music needs more pep, but found a few songs worth saving. He goes with a {tag: Burn It} for JT.

## 00:21:24 Review: Franz Ferdinand
![Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action (Deluxe Edition)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e1/Franz_Ferdinand_-_Right_Thoughts_Right_Words_Right_Action-cover.jpg "6596751/665284851")
It has been four years since the {place: Scottish} quartet [{artist: Franz Ferdinand}](/show/181) released an album. But, {album: Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action} picks up where the band left off—smart, tongue-in-cheek wordplay meets catchy hooks and dance beats. The album is not as strong as the band's debut, [according](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-08-27/entertainment/sc-ent-0823-music-franz-ferdinand-20130827_1_franz-ferdinand-alex-kapranos-pop-music) to {host: Greg}, so he goes with a {tag: Burn It} rating. {host: Jim} thinks he's being stingy. He loves this {era: new-millennial} {artist: Roxy Music} and says {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:27:21 Review: The Weeknd
![Kiss Land](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/3d/06/18/3d0618fe-a8e8-7c31-85d8-61007f1d20e1/source/600x600bb.jpg "479756766/689559593")

{artist: The Weeknd}, aka {name: Abel Tesfaye}, has released his first studio album called {album: Kiss Land}. It comes after a series of successful self-released mixtapes. {host: Jim} continues to be fascinated by this artist's soulful "ennui" and recommends you {tag: Buy It}. {host: Greg}, on the other hand, thinks {artist: Drake}'s doing this style better. Tesfaye switched producers, possibly in an effort to be more commercial. But what it really is, is less interesting. He says {tag: Burn It}.

## 00:33:23 Review: HAIM
![Days Are Gone](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ae/Haim_-_Days_Are_Gone.png "164483115/681237313")
{place: L.A.} sisters {artist: HAIM} have been getting a lot of buzz leading up to their debut release {album: Days Are Gone}. Perhaps it's the hair? It certainly can't be because of their allegiance to {place: '80s} {genre: pop} production values. Forget grit and grime, {host: Greg} can't find a speck of lint on these glossy songs. {host: Jim} hears yet another slick influence: {artist: Wilson Phillips}. 'Nuff Said. Haim gets a {tag: Trash It}.

## 00:42:45 Review: Elvis Costello & The Roots
![Wise Up Ghost](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music4/v4/a1/26/1b/a1261b36-0503-8e62-8fee-fd653c7a778c/source/600x600bb.jpg "497911/673399992")

Some artist's choice of musical collaborators can either be a match made in [heaven](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Velvet_Underground_%26_Nico), or a deal made with the [devil](http://www.wbez.org/blog/jim-derogatis/2011-10-28/album-review-lou-reed-metallica-%E2%80%98lulu%E2%80%99-warner-bros-93514). {place: English} {genre: singer/songwriter} {artist: Elvis Costello}'s lengthy career has got plenty of both. Jim [thinks](http://www.wbez.org/blogs/jim-derogatis/2013-09/rim-shots-elvis-costello-roots-and-haim-108778) Costello's latest album, {album: Wise Up Ghost}, with legendary {genre: hip-hop} group {artist: The Roots}, is another miss—a clunky exercise in genre busting with Costello too far out of his element. {host: Jim} can hardly wait to {tag: Trash It}. Greg is less annoyed with the looseness of the album, [finding](http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/turnitup/sc-ent-0913-music-elvis-costello-roots-20130913,0,2811699.column) Costello and The Roots more or less in sync, and the songwriting strong enough in the first half of the album to keep the whole thing afloat. {host: Greg} says {tag: Burn It}.

## 00:49:21 DIJ: Jim
Not taking any cues from either Greg or the news this week, {host: Jim} instead opts to pick an album at random out of his personal collection. With eyes closed, his finger landed on {host: trip-hop} group {artist: Morcheeba}'s {era: 1998} album {album: The Big Calm} and the song "{track: Part of the Process}." The group's early albums were their best, combining elements of {genre: spaghetti western} and {genre: film noir} soundtracks with playful musical surprises like this track's country {tag: fiddle}. The band broke up in {era: 2003}, but is now reunited with a promising [return-to-form](http://youtu.be/qKFMK2eDWeQ) later this month.
