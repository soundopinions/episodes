Much like the bubblegum pop of {artist: One Direction} and its ilk, {genre: K Pop} - Korean pop music - remains firmly under the radar for most American music fans over age 15. But don't write this super-shiny Korean export off; according to {tag: Spin} magazine editor {name: David Bevan}, K Pop could have a major impact on the U.S. music industry. Bevan recently visited Korea, and he explains to Jim and Greg how entertainment companies there build K Pop boy and girl groups from the ground up. After training teenage recruits in song craft, choreography and foreign language, companies like {label: YG} and {label: JYP} form them into multilingual pop products specially designed to target international markets. It's a business model so efficient you can bet struggling American record labels are taking notes.

## 00:10:31 Interview: Joe Nick Patoski on Willie Nelson
![willie-book](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2012/willie-book.jpg)
At age 79, {place: Texas} musician {artist: Willie Nelson} has released his 66th studio album, {album: Heroes} . Few artists can rival Nelson's longevity, or boast a more wide-ranging musical career. In his many decades making music, Willie has never fit into any boxes-rock/country, religious/profane. On the occasion of Heroes, Jim and Greg revisit their conversation with Nelson {tag: biographer} {name: Joe Nick Patoski}. As Patoski reveals in his book *Willie Nelson: An Epic Life*, Nelson's non-conformity is what makes him such an amazing musician and such a thriving American icon. Jim and Greg discuss with Joe Nick the difficulties Willie had in making the transition from a songwriter to a successful solo artist. They also talk about his family history, his outlaw status, both literal and figurative, and his role as the "zen bubba" of pot.

## 00:43:21 Feature: Stranded For Real
{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} never get tired of asking each other the rock fan's favorite question: What record would you take with you if stranded on a {tag: desert island}? But for listener {name: Alex Gunderson}, this parlor game was real life. After graduating with a degree in biology, he tells Jim and Greg, he found himself studying the sea bird in the {place: Galapagos Islands} for seven months. With only a solar-powered discman for musical company, Alex had a choice to make: What CDs to bring? Sadly, he says even old standbys like {artist: Miles Davis}, {artist: Pink Floyd}, and {artist: The Allman Brothers} got old after the thousandth listen. His recommendation for real-life desert island DJs? Take something to the island you haven't yet figured out.

## 00:51:21 DIJ: Greg
Still smarting from Jim's put-down of {artist: The Jam} during our Best Second Acts show, {host: Greg} goes with the mod-rock group's track "{track: That's Entertainment}" for his {tag: Desert Island Jukebox} pick this week. From the group's fifth studio album {album: Sound Affects}, "That's Entertainment" takes its name from a song in the old Hollywood movie *The Band Wagon*. Greg says the title choice was tongue-in-cheek. For {tag: songwriter} and {tag: vocalist} {name: Paul Weller}, "entertainment" is walking though his working class {place: British neighborhood}, chronicling the ordinary lives of dissatisfied people dreaming of something better. The real sense of empathy comes from Weller's falsetto voice, says Greg, which combined with {name: Bruce Foxton}'s harmonies puts the song over the top.
