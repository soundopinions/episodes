## 00:01:45 Intro: Music News

{artist : Adam  "MCA"  Yauch}, one of the three founding members of the {artist : Beastie Boys}, died last week after a three year battle with throat cancer. As Greg notes, the Beastie Boys didn't just transform hip hop. Yauch also transformed himself. After releasing two best-selling albums, {album : License to Ill} and {album : Paul's Boutique}, Yauch noticed how the group's (sometimes jokey, sometimes offensive) lyrics affected people. He began to incorporate his own political and spiritual views into the Beasties' music, without being too preachy. A great example of this is the 1994 track "{track : Sure Shot}."
