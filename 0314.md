## 00:01:45 Intro: Music News

What's an ousted {tag : prime minister} to do with all his free time? Release an album of course. Former {place : Italian} leader {name : Silvio Berlusconi} co-wrote all 11 tracks on the new album of love songs by {artist : Mariano Apicella}. {album : True Love} sounds a little more Spanish than Italian to Jim, but he's mostly amused that a twice-married man who has had his fair share of sex scandals would try his hand at love ballads. In other musical-political crossovers, {place : Senegalese} musician {artist : Youssou N'Dour} is giving up his current career to run for office. The man {tag : Rolling Stone} once named the most famous living African singer hasn't announced which office, but many are speculating that he'll go for the highest one, {tag : President}.

In other news, {artist : Elvis Costello} is taking a unique marketing tact in promoting his new album {album : The Return of the Spectacular Spinning Songbook}. He says, "Don't buy it." At $200, Costello thinks the box set is overpriced, and he'd instead {tag : recommend} you invest your money in something more worthwhile-a {artist : Louis Armstrong} box set priced at less than $150.



## 00:06:49 Interview: Trombone Shorty

Up next, {name : Troy "Trombone Shorty" Andrews} and his band {artist : Orleans Avenue}. At just 25, Troy has already been playing music for two decades, and professionally for nearly as long. He has recorded half a dozen albums, toured the world and collaborated with a who's who of {place : New Orleans} legends like {artist : The Nevilles} and {artist : Rebirth Brass Band}, in addition to {artist : Green Day}, {artist : Jeff Beck} and {artist : Eric Clapton}. Somehow he also found time to play himself in a recurring role on the hit {tag : HBO} show {tag : *Treme*}, which takes place in his neighborhood in New Orleans' {place : 6th ward}. Jim and Greg were anxious to hear the group perform songs from Trombone Shorty's albums {album : For True} and {album : Backatown}. They also wanted to hear about Troy's experience after {tag : Hurricane Katrina} and his philosophy on so-called rules of {genre : jazz}. Listen or [watch](https://vimeo.com/groups/207888) and you'll hear (luckily) there are none.



## 00:44:26 Review: Brian Wilson

![Smile](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/314/2220.jpg)

{artist : Beach Boys} fans have been waiting over forty years for {artist : Brian Wilson}'s lost record, {album : Smile}. Now we can finally hear those abandoned recordings from {era : 1967} on the {album : Smile Sessions}. But as {host : Jim} explains, a lost album usually deserves to stay that way. He doesn't hear any of the emotion that made Wilson's masterpiece {artist : Pet Sounds} so wonderful. And the studio experimentation is more mess than art. The Smile Sessions detract from the {artist : Beach Boys} legacy, according to Jim, so he says {tag : Trash It}. {host : Greg} would've expected different from a Syd Barrett fan. He hears a lot of idiosyncratic whimsy. Sure, it's not as emotional as Pet Sounds, but it's a "fascinating curio" and successful song cycle. Greg says {tag : Buy It}.



## 00:51:24 DIJ: Jim

Jim returns to {place : New Orleans} for his {tag : Desert Island Jukebox} selection this week. In addition, there's an element of psychedelic lunacy on his pick, as there is on {album : Smile}. The record is {artist : Dr. John}'s 1968 release {album : Gris Gris}, and the song is "{track : Gris Gris Gumbo Ya Ya}." You'll never hear anything like it.
