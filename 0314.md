## 00:01:45 News: 12.2.2011
What's an ousted {tag: prime minister} to do with all his free time? Release an album of course. Former {place: Italian} leader {name: Silvio Berlusconi} co-wrote all 11 tracks on the new album of love songs by {artist: Mariano Apicella}. {album: True Love} sounds a little more Spanish than Italian to Jim, but he's mostly amused that a twice-married man who has had his fair share of sex scandals would try his hand at love ballads. In other musical-political crossovers, {place: Senegalese} musician {artist: Youssou N'Dour} is giving up his current career to run for office. The man {tag: Rolling Stone} once named the most famous living African singer hasn't announced which office, but many are speculating that he'll go for the highest one, {tag: President}.

In other news, {artist: Elvis Costello} is taking a unique marketing tact in promoting his new album {album: The Return of the Spectacular Spinning Songbook}. He says, "Don't buy it." At $200, Costello thinks the box set is overpriced, and he'd instead {tag: recommend} you invest your money in something more worthwhile-a {artist: Louis Armstrong} box set priced at less than $150.

## 00:06:49 Interview: Trombone Shorty
Up next, {name: Troy "Trombone Shorty" Andrews} and his band {artist: Orleans Avenue}. At just 25, Troy has already been playing music for two decades, and professionally for nearly as long. He has recorded half a dozen albums, toured the world and collaborated with a who's who of {place: New Orleans} legends like {artist: The Nevilles} and {artist: Rebirth Brass Band}, in addition to {artist: Green Day}, {artist: Jeff Beck} and {artist: Eric Clapton}. Somehow he also found time to play himself in a recurring role on the hit {tag: HBO} show {tag: *Treme*}, which takes place in his neighborhood in New Orleans' {place: 6th ward}. Jim and Greg were anxious to hear the group perform songs from Trombone Shorty's albums {album: For True} and {album: Backatown}. They also wanted to hear about Troy's experience after {tag: Hurricane Katrina} and his philosophy on so-called rules of {genre: jazz}. Listen or [watch](https://vimeo.com/groups/207888) and you'll hear (luckily) there are none.

## 00:44:26 Review: Brian Wilson
![Smile](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/40/0e/89/400e8974-70c9-53d8-b8f5-2c48e5b30b9e/source/600x600bb.jpg "61573/29164695")

{artist: Beach Boys} fans have been waiting over forty years for {artist: Brian Wilson}'s lost record, {album: Smile}. Now we can finally hear those abandoned recordings from {era: 1967} on the {album: Smile Sessions}. But as {host: Jim} explains, a lost album usually deserves to stay that way. He doesn't hear any of the emotion that made Wilson's masterpiece {artist: Pet Sounds} so wonderful. And the studio experimentation is more mess than art. The Smile Sessions detract from the {artist: Beach Boys} legacy, according to Jim, so he says {tag: Trash It}. {host: Greg} would've expected different from a Syd Barrett fan. He hears a lot of idiosyncratic whimsy. Sure, it's not as emotional as Pet Sounds, but it's a "fascinating curio" and successful song cycle. Greg says {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:51:24 DIJ: Jim
Jim returns to {place: New Orleans} for his {tag: Desert Island Jukebox} selection this week. In addition, there's an element of psychedelic lunacy on his pick, as there is on {album: Smile}. The record is {artist: Dr. John}'s 1968 release {album: Gris Gris}, and the song is "{track: Gris Gris Gumbo Ya Ya}." You'll never hear anything like it.
