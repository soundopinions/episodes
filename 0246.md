{tag: Buried Treasures}: {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} dig up a new chest of lesser known musical gems you need to hear.

## 00:01:53 Intro: Music News
Fans have long been wondering when {artist: the Beatles} will finally come to {tag: iTunes}. Well, according to {name: Yoko Ono}, not anytime soon. {name: John Lennon}'s widow recently said fans shouldn't hold their breath, adding  "There's just an element that we're not very happy about, as people. We are holding out."  But, rest assured, that when {tag: Apple Inc}. and {tag: Apple Corps}. do come to an agreement, digital sales will start flying. When the Beatles released their reissues last year, they sold 2.25 million copies in the first five days of release.

{artist: Lady Gaga} has a record breaking 13 nominations for {tag: MTV Video Music Awards}. But, ironically, her videos will no longer be available on {tag: MTV.com}. Gaga's label {label: Universal} has decided to take all its content off the music channel's website and show them instead on the label-owned {tag: Vevo}. Jim and Greg think it will be interesting to see what kind of industry influence MTV can sustain without much music content on its airwaves or website.

Sometimes life does imitate art. "{track: If I Was President}" singer {artist: Wyclef Jean} is, in fact, running for president. The {place: Haitian} born former Fugee announced his official candidacy for president of the devastated nation last week. While Jean faces a number of barriers on his road to the office, including controversies regarding his charities and taxes and, of course, celebrity, this got Jim and Greg thinking about some other pop politicos including {artist: Sonny Bono}, who served in {tag: Congress} and as the {tag: mayor} of {place: Palm Springs}, {name: Peter Garrett} of {artist: Midnight Oil}, who is an {tag: Australian Labor Party} member of the {tag: Australian House of Representatives} and is the {tag: Minister for Environment Protection, Heritage and the Arts}, and The {artist: Doobie Brothers}' {name: Jeff "Skunk" Baxter} who now serves as a defense consultant and chairs a {tag: Congressional Advisory Board on missile defense}.

## 00:46:29 Review: Tom Jones
![Praise & Blame](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/246/25H0.jpg)
{artist: Tom Jones} has been loosening knickers for half a century. Now he's back with a more "serious" album called {album: Praise and Blame}, but {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} wish he was still pushing the feel good hits. Following in the path of late career comebacks like {artist: Johnny Cash} and {artist: Neil Diamond}, Jones lends his baritone to classic blues and folk covers. The voice is still there, Jim admits, but with it none of the camp or smarm. Greg doesn't find these renditions authentic, and wishes Jones would just embrace his persona. Praise and Blame gets a double {tag: Trash It}.
