This week, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} explore the history and legacy of the almost 50-year-old {place: Chicago} {genre: blues} label, {tag: Alligator Records}, with its founder {tag: Bruce Iglauer}. They'll talk to him about his new book {tag: Bitten By the Blues: The Alligator Records Story} and discuss some of the landmark artists who came through, from {artist: Koko Taylor} to {artist: Albert Collins}.

## 00:01:31 Interview: Alligator Records' Bruce Iglauer

{label: Alligator Records} is a {place: Chicago} {genre: blues} label that's been around for almost 50 years. While not necessarily a household name, Alligator Records has captured some of the most potent artists Chicago has offered since 1970, and has always championed a raw and unvarnished sound - not unlike {genre: punk} in that way.

In 1970, 23-year-old {tag: Bruce Iglauer} came to Chicago to work for the {genre: jazz} and blues label {label: Delmark Records}, but quickly decided to stake out on his own. At a time when the blues was waning in popularity and prominence, Iglauer recognized that there was an audience of young {genre: rock} fans who were interested in expanding their musical tastes. So, this young white guy assembles a roster of some of the most iconic artists of the genre, people like {artist: Albert Collins} and {artist: Koko Taylor}, and gets people excited about the music again. In his recent book {tag: Bitten By the Blues: The Alligator Records Story}, Bruce Iglauer, along with co-writer Patrick A. Roberts, tells the story of the evolution of Alligator, its landmark artists and its importance in music history. 


## 00:34:15 Interview: Buddy Guy

{genre: Blues} legend and fellow {place: Chicago}an {artist: Buddy Guy} visited the show back in 2007. 
One thing that makes Buddy Guy's music so unique is his sense of melody. He explains how he will listen to {genre: spiritual} and {genre: gospel} music on the radio as inspiration. As Greg states: he's trying to imitate the voices. He learned this from {artist: B.B. King}. Another musician who inspired Buddy was {artist: Guitar Slim}. Before seeing Slim play, Buddy didn't know how far he could go with a "strat." Now he is known for his violent, high-energy style. This style wasn't appreciated by his former label {label: Chess Records}, but was adored and emulated by British blues fans like {artist: Eric Clapton}, {artist: Jeff Beck} and {artist: Andy Summers}. This week, we revisit the 2007 interview and are also treated to a rare, acoustic performance from Guy and his bandmember at the time, Rick Hall.
