## 00:00:41 Review: André 3000

As one half of {artist : Outkast}, {artist : André 300}0 gained a reputation as one of the greatest rappers of all time. Now on his first album since Outkast disbanded, André is not rapping at all. Instead, “{album : New Blue Sun}” features him improvising on the flute with an accomplished ambient ensemble.


## 00:09:19 Review: MJ Lenderman

{artist : MJ Lenderman} has been gaining notice lately as a solo artist and as the guitarist of Wednesday. After signing with ANTI- Records, Lenderman released a live album called “{album : And The Wind (Live and Loose!)}.” Jim and Greg agree that the performances and recording quality of these songs are an improvement over many of their original releases, but also agree that comparing this album to Neil Young’s “Rust Never Sleeps” is a stretch. 


## 00:16:49 Interview: Jamila Woods

{artist : Jamila Woods} has released three full-length albums and each one has been outstanding. A poet, activist, teacher and musician, Woods brings a unique perspective to her musical compositions. For “{album : Water Made Us},” Woods is more personal, vulnerable and also funnier than ever before.
