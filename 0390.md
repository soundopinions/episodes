## 00:01:48 News: 5.17.2013
{tag: Google Music} entered the music-streaming fray this week with its new "All Access" service for {tag: Android}. The world's top search engine is touting {tag: All Access} as a combination of the best features of {tag: Pandora} and {tag: Spotify}. It offers curated "radio" stations alongside millions of tracks users can stream across devices. And {tag: Google} is hoping users will pony up for that kind of access: unlike its competitors, Google's service will not offer a free option.

Forget the Desert Island - what music would you take to outer space? This week Canadian astronaut {name: Chris Hadfield} made news by covering {artist: David Bowie}'s "{track: Space Oddity}" from the {tag: International Space Station}. This isn't the first time rock has blasted into orbit. Last year Jim covered the auction of {tag: Apollo 14} astronaut {tag: Edgar Mitchell}'s space mixtape, which featured tunes by {artist: Creedence Clearwater Revival} and {artist: Marvin Gaye}. So what tracks would {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} want to jam to in zero gravity? Greg picks {artist: Sun Ra}'s "{track: Calling Planet Earth}," whereas Jim sticks with a classic, {artist: The Beatles}' "{track: Here Comes the Sun}."

## 00:06:08 Interview: Peter Hook
{artist: Joy Division} only recorded two proper studio albums before lead singer {name: Ian Curtis} committed suicide in 1980. But those releases, a string of fantastic singles and Curtis' own legend continue to impact fans today. But, as is often the case with legends, there's a lot of fiction amongst the fact. And {name: Peter Hook}, the hugely influential {tag: bass player} in Joy Division and {artist: New Order}, wants to clear a few things up in his book {tag: Unknown Pleasures: Inside Joy Division}. First, there's the tragic image of Ian itself. True, he struggled with depression, a failing marriage and a debilitating case of epilepsy that would lead to his death. But, Peter describes a beer-drinking prankster full of joy when it came to the music. He also admits that he and the band weren't initially crazy about the sparse, moody sound Joy Division fans so love today. Much of that credit goes to {tag: producer} {name: Martin Hannett}. For more on Joy Division listen to this [episode](http://www.soundopinions.org/show/101).

Then of course we come to New Order's bitter divorce. {name: Bernard Sumner}, {name: Stephen Morris} and Peter achieved more success than Joy Division. They disbanded in 2006, but recently reunited without Peter. Listening to the [interview](https://soundcloud.com/soundopinions/peter-hook-talks-about-new) you can hear the hard feelings, but Peter admits he'd play with those amazing musicians anytime. So how did New Order fare on their recent release without Peter Hook? Check out Jim and Greg's [review](/show/374/review/neworder). 
 
## 00:49:31 Review: Chance the Rapper
![Album Art](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/390/2AJ0.jpg)

A number of {place: Chicago} rappers are blowing up right now-{artist: Chief Keef}, {artist: King Louie}, {artist: Lil Durk}. But unlike those "drill scene" artists, {artist: Chance the Rapper} is the kid next door. {host: Jim} loves that this "extraordinary artist" can be both deeply profound and also funny as heck on his new mixtape {album: Acid Rap}. He calls "{track: Pushaman}" the "[Ohio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_(Crosby,_Stills,_Nash_%26_Young_song))" that Chicago needs. {host: Greg} is also loving the goofy, self-deprecating lyrics and hears a huge amount of growth on this second, deeply moving mixtape. Acid Rap gets a double {tag: Buy It}, and yet it's completely free!
