# Show 433: Mike Watt of Minutemen & Reviews of Pharrell Williams and The War on Drugs

![The Minutemen](http://static.soundopinions.org/images/2014/theminutemen_web.jpg)

With his classic album {album: Double Nickels on the Dime} about to turn 30, bassist {name: Mike Watt} of {artist: Minutemen} speaks with hosts {host: Jim DeRogatis} and {host: Greg Kot} . Later they review new albums from "{track: Happy}" {artist: Pharrell Williams} and {artist: The War on Drugs}.

## 00:01:44 Interview: Mike Watt

By the {era: early 1980's}, {genre: punk} had become less about sticking it to the man, and more about conforming to a set of rules. Then came the {artist: Minutemen} with {album: Double Nickels on the Dime}, the {era: 1984} album that threw out the punk rulebook. To celebrate the 30th anniversary of *Double Nickels*, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} revisit their 2011 conversation with Minutemen bassist {name: Mike Watt}, who founded the {place: San Pedro} {genre: hardcore} group alongside drummer {name: George Hurley} and larger-than-life lead singer and guitarist {name: D. Boon}. The Minutemen weren't afraid to experiment with their sound, incorporating {genre: jazz} and {genre: funk}, as well as "{tag: Econo}"—a lo-fi, DIY attitude that would later inspire {genre: indie rock}. Ever the motor-mouth philosopher, Watt waxes poetic about jamming econo, the true meaning of "{album: Double Nickels on the Dime}," and his idea of a "{tag: Hot Topic}."

## 00:36:53 Review: Pharrell Williams
![G I R L](//static.soundopinions.org/images/pharrell-girl.jpg)
For a long time, baby-faced {name: Pharrell Williams} was better known as a {tag: producer} for artists like {artist: Jay-Z} and his own {artist: N.E.R.D.} But in {era: 2006} {artist: Pharrell} stepped out more as a vocalist, releasing a lukewarm [solo album](show/35) and increasing his guest appereances on other artist's tracks. In {era: 2012}, two of those tracks, one with {artist: Robin Thicke} and the other with {artist: Daft Punk}, launched him to new heights of stardom. And with that momentum, Williams is back with a second solo album. {album: G I R L}'s slick combination of {genre: disco} and {genre: R&B} sounds make the record an instant {tag: Try It} for {host: Jim}. He would've gone Buy It if it weren't for Pharrell's tired lyrics about women. {host: Greg} also sighs at the empty lyrics, adding that Williams should stick with what he does best: producing. His ability to channel dancable rhythms from the likes of {artist: Prince} and {artist: Stevie Wonder} is his greatest asset and ultimately the only thing earning {album: G I R L} a {tag: Try It}. 


## 00:44:00 Review: The War on Drugs
![Lost in the Dream](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/d8/4c/94/d84c9481-9f5c-80b9-4f1d-74d1451751c1/source/600x600bb.jpg "282078681/765568650")
The {place: Philadelphia} band {artist: The War on Drugs} straddles the line between {genre: indie} singer/songwriter and {genre: psychedelic} rock. It was originally founded by {artist: Kurt Vile} and {name: Adam Granduceil}, but Vile has since left to pursue a solo career. Granduceil continued as {artist: The War on Drugs}, releasing a  moderately succesful record called {album: Slave Ambient} in {era: 2011}. His new album, {album: Lost in the Dream}, is his best, according to {host: Jim}. Working out the songs on the road created a wonderful live atmosphere. It's perfect headphone music, says {host: Jim}:  {tag: Buy It}. {host: Greg} likes the record as well, but wishes some of the more meandering tracks were better edited. He gives {album: Lost in the Dream} a {tag: Try It} rating.


## 00:49:46 DIJ: Greg
During his conversation with {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}, {name: Mike Watt} reveals some of {artist: Minutemen}'s more surprising influences. One that didn't come up, but has been cited in the past, is {artist: Blue Öyster Cult}. But, as Greg explains, the more you think about it, the more that affinity makes sense. This hard rock arena band was actually masterminded by producer (and former rock critic) {name: Sandy Pearlman}. And some of the bands lyricists were {artist: Patti Smith} and critic {name: Richard Meltzer}. So you have the heft of literary words with the speed and intensity of {genre: punk} rock. You can hear that combination in a song Watt continues to perform to this day: "{track: The Red and the Black}" by {artist: Blue Öyster Cult}.
