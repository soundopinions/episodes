# Show 727: Janis Joplin, Opinions on Kanye West & Neil Young and Crazy Horse

![janis](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2019/janis.jpg)

{artist: Janis Joplin} was known for her iconic singing voice, gregarious image and refusal to conform. But behind her chill, {genre: blues} mama persona was an intellectual, intentional artist. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} discuss the life and career of Janis Joplin with author and biographer {tag: Holly George-Warren}. They talk about the legacy of Joplin's music and identity almost 50 years after her tragic death. Jim and Greg will also review new albums from {artist: Kanye West} and {artist: Neil Young and Crazy Horse}.


## 00:01:21 Review: Kanye West
![Kanye](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/727/290.jpg) 
{artist: Kanye West} is back with the highly anticipated album, {album: Jesus Is King}. According to Greg, lately Kanye has been making more headlines for his proclamations than his music. This album has been the subject of scrutiny, however, because it marks a stylistic turn. A {genre: gospel} and {genre: hip hop} hybrid, Greg notes that Kanye is "very earnest in his use of the gospel signifiers on this record, the {genre: gospel} choirs, the churchy keyboard chords." Even contemporary gospel legend Fred Hammond features on the track "{track: Hands On}." Jim agrees that the gospel production and even messaging in this album seems to be coming from an authentic place. They both are quick to acknowledge that Kanye has a long history of folding gospel sensibilities into his music (particularly on tracks like "{track: Jesus Walks}" and "{track: Ultralight Beam}.") Though both Jim and Greg acknowledge that "only Kanye" could come up with the idea to merge {artist: The Clipse} and {artist: Kenny G} on the same track "({track: Use This Gospel})," Greg laments that the album seems unfinished and asks "where is the work of art like {album: My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy}?" Jim suggests that Kanye, like {artist: John Lennon} in his early {artist: Plastic Ono Band} period, "not thinking about {artist: Beatles} perfection… letting it blurt." Ultimately, Jim thinks that this album is the best Kanye has given us in some time, while Greg thinks that though Kanye is on the "Road To Damascus," (an allusion to the prophet Paul's religious conversion on the Road To Damascus) "… he hasn't gotten there yet."

##  00:09:21 Review: Neil Young with Crazy Horse
![Neil Young with Crazy Horse](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/727/FL0.jpg)
On {artist: Neil Young}'s 39th studio album and first with {artist: Crazy Horse} in seven years, there's a directness to the lyrics that {host: Greg} calls nearly unprecedented in his career. The lyrical urgency is spurred on by Young's concern over {tag: climate change}. {host: Jim} and Greg agree that the earnestness produces a few cringe-worthy lyrics, but also appreciate the lack of self-consciousness he brings to the songs. 

Musically Young and his long-time rock collaborators in Crazy Horse pick up right where they left off, chiseling away at the one epic rock they always have, as Greg puts it. He says he lives for the guitar solos on tracks like "{track: She Showed Me Love}." Jim also appreciates the quieter acoustic songs on the album, citing "{track: I Do}" as a beautiful love song. He suggests that a few songs from {album: Colorado} could be paired with a handful from each of Young's recent albums to make a nice companion to his {album: Decade} compilation.

## 00:20:01 Interview: Holly George-Warren on Janis Joplin
![janis](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/727/XD0.jpg)
It's been over 50 years since {artist: Janis Joplin} first shocked the music world with her soulful voice, energetic stage presence and unabashed sense of self. And unfortunately, a lot about Janis's life has been sensationalized because of her seemingly meteoric rise to fame and subsequent tragic death at age 27 from a drug overdose. But behind that carefree, {genre: blues} mama persona was an intellectual, hard working and intentional artist. 

This week, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} talk to music journalist {tag: Holly George-Warren}, author of the new book {tag: Janis: Her Life and Music}. It's a fascinating read and is full of letters, documents and interviews that help get to the core of who Janis Joplin really was. They talk about the legacy of Joplin's music and identity almost 50 years after her tragic death.
