## 00:01:45 Interview: Jack White
Back in 2012, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} went down to {place: Nashville} to interview {artist: Jack White} at his recording studio and record store {label: Third Man Records}. They talked about the people in his early life that helped shape his musical taste, introducing the budding musician to {artist: The Rolling Stones} and {artist: The Cramps}. They discussed the truth found in the {genre: blues} and that sound set the trajectory of Jack's most famous band ({artist: The White Stripes}), his affinity for vinyl records, and his other notable projects.

![Rickenbacker 12-string](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2017/rickenbacker_web.JPG)
This week, we kick off a new feature called {tag: Instrumental} where we examine the history of iconic instruments of rock. We start with the {tag: electric 12-string guitar} and its most famous manufacturer, {tag: Rickenbacker}. After the acoustic 12-string guitar was popularized by {genre: blues} artists like {artist: Lead Belly} and by the '{era: 60s} {genre: folk} revival, Rickenbacker began making an electrified version. After {name: George Harrison} used it on {artist: The Beatles}' "{track: A Hard Day's Night}," a 12-string craze began. The most notable adopter of the instrument was {name: Jim [McGuinn]} (later {name: Roger [McGuinn]}) McGuinn , who used it to define the sound of {artist: The Byrds} on tracks like "{track: Mr. Tambourine Man}" and "{track: Turn! Turn! Turn!}" The Beatles and The Byrds set the template for countless bands in the ensuing decades who used 12-strings, from {genre: power pop} acts like {artist: Raspberries} and {artist: Big Star}, to {genre: jangle pop} bands like {artist: R.E.M.} and {artist: The Bangles}, to contemporary artists like {artist: Temples}.

To help discuss and demonstrate the Rickenbacker electric 12-string, we're joined by {name: Daniel Escauriza} and {name: Shelby Pollard} of [{place: Chicago Music Exchange}](https://www.chicagomusicexchange.com/). {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} also offer their favorite examples of Rick-heavy songs: "{track: Awaken}" by {artist: Yes} and {artist: XTC}'s "{track: All of a Sudden (It's Too Late)}."

Musician {artist: Gregg Allman} died May 27 at the age of 69. Gregg was a crucial member of {artist: The Allman Brothers Band}, a group at the forefront of the {genre: southern rock} genre, though they didn't like to be labeled as such. The band's combined the {genre: blues}, {genre: jazz}, {genre: rock} and {genre: psychedelia} to make for a original sound. Gregg was the voice of the band, the organ player and the primary songwriter, writing hits like "{track: Midnight Rider}," "{track: Whipping Post}" and "{track: Melissa}." Greg Kot pays tribute to Gregg Allman with a track that's actually a demo called "{track: Dreams}." "Dreams" was the song that first helped the band take him seriously as a songwriter.
