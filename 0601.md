## 00:01:45 Interview: Jack White

Back in 2012, {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} went down to {place : Nashville} to interview {artist : Jack White} at his recording studio and record store {label : Third Man Records}. They talked about the people in his early life that helped shape his musical taste, introducing the budding musician to {artist : The Rolling Stones} and {artist : The Cramps}. They discussed the truth found in the {genre : blues} and that sound set the trajectory of Jack's most famous band ({artist : The White Stripes}), his affinity for vinyl records, and his other notable projects.

This week, we kick off a new feature called {tag : Instrumental} where we examine the history of iconic instruments of rock. We start with the {tag : electric 12-string guitar} and its most famous manufacturer, {tag : Rickenbacker}. After the acoustic 12-string guitar was popularized by {genre : blues} artists like {artist : Lead Belly} and by the '{era : 60s}  {genre : folk} revival, Rickenbacker began making an electrified version. After {name : George Harrison} used it on {artist : The Beatles}' "{track : A Hard Day's Night}," a 12-string craze began. The most notable adopter of the instrument was {name : Jim [McGuinn]} (later {name : Roger [McGuinn]}) McGuinn , who used it to define the sound of {artist : The Byrds} on tracks like "{track : Mr. Tambourine Man}" and "{track : Turn! Turn! Turn!}" The Beatles and The Byrds set the template for countless bands in the ensuing decades who used 12-strings, from {genre : power pop} acts like {artist : Raspberries} and {artist : Big Star}, to {genre : jangle pop} bands like {artist : R.E.M.} and {artist : The Bangles}, to contemporary artists like {artist : Temples}.

To help discuss and demonstrate the Rickenbacker electric 12-string, we're joined by {name : Daniel Escauriza} and {name : Shelby Pollard} of [{place : Chicago Music Exchange}](https://www.chicagomusicexchange.com/). {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} also offer their favorite examples of Rick-heavy songs: "{track : Awaken}" by {artist : Yes} and {artist : XTC}'s "{track : All of a Sudden (It's Too Late)}."

Musician {artist : Gregg Allman} died May 27 at the age of 69. Gregg was a crucial member of {artist : The Allman Brothers Band}, a group at the forefront of the {genre : southern rock} genre, though they didn't like to be labeled as such. The band's combined the {genre : blues}, {genre : jazz}, {genre : rock} and {genre : psychedelia} to make for a original sound. Gregg was the voice of the band, the organ player and the primary songwriter, writing hits like "{track : Midnight Rider}," "{track : Whipping Post}" and "{track : Melissa}." Greg Kot pays tribute to Gregg Allman with a track that's actually a demo called "{track : Dreams}." "Dreams" was the song that first helped the band take him seriously as a songwriter.
