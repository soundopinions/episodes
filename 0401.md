## 00:01:49 News: 8.02.2013
While pop divas like {artist: Katy Perry} and {artist: Lady Gaga} have impressive strategic plans for their upcoming albums, news from {artist: Beyonce's} camp suggest things are more chaotic over there. Sources told the {tag: Hollywood Reporter} she recently scrapped 50 songs and is starting over, despite having the promotional push of the [Superbowl](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKVorba5GLs) and a world [tour](http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/turnitup/chi-beyonce-concert-review-20130717,0,724260.column). 

Is it fair to say [{artist: Jack White's}](http://jackwhiteiii.com/news/) an all-around good guy? First, he may have donated money to a {place: Detroit} baseball field. Then he pitches in to save the city's historic {place: Masonic Temple}. And now he's made a generous $200,000 donation to the {tag: National Recording Preservation Foundation}. Three cheers for this former guest!

Influential guitar player and songwriter {artist: J.J. Cale} died this week at age 74. Countless musicians have covered Cale over the years, from {artist: Captain Beefheart} to {artist: Neil Young}. And to honor him, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} play one of Young's favorites, "{track: Crazy Mama}." 

## 00:08:23 List: Best Instrumentals
The history of rock 'n' roll is filled with memorable lyrics, but sometimes it's the wordless songs that stick. This week, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} celebrate the Best Instrumentals. Not just any "instrumental" track will do. Both Jim and Greg agree, no "fa fa fa's" or "la la la's" admitted. Here are their lists:

### Greg 
- {artist: Duane Eddy}, "{track: Peter Gunn}"
- {artist: Booker T. & The MG's}, "{track: Time is Tight}"
- {artist: Higher Intelligence Agency}, "{track: Spectral}"
- {artist: Deltron 3030}, "Mastermind (Instrumental)"

### Jim
- {artist: Dick Dale}, "{track: Misirlou}"
- {artist: Wire}, "{track: The Commercial}"
- {artist: Future Sound of London}, "{track: Antique Toy}"
- {artist: Keyboard Money Mark}, "{track: Revolt of the Octopi}"

### Listeners' picks:

- Drew James in West Allis, Wisconsin: {artist: Frank Zappa}, "{track: Peaches En Regalia}"
- Amy Loberger in Oak Creek, Wisconsin: {artist: Led Zeppelin}, "{track: Moby Dick}"
- Andy Mitchell in Chicago, Illinois: {artist: Four Tet}, "{track: My Angel Rocks Back and Forth}"
- John Chrissos in Rochester, New York: {artist: Simple Minds}, "{track: Theme for Great Cities}"

## 00:48:55 Review: Trouble
![The Distortion Field](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/44/09/73/44097338-f61e-a501-c5a2-cc065c18b5be/source/600x600bb.jpg "1203701169/1203701159")
Call 'em {genre: doom metal} or stoner rock, the Chicago band {artist: Trouble} has been bringing the heavy since 1979. The band's new album {album: The Distortion Field} reunites original guitarists {name: Bruce Franklin} and {name: Rick Wartell}, and subs in {name: Kyle Thomas} for longtime vocalist {name: Eric Wagner}. Does the reunited band fare better with the critics than {artist: Black Sabbath} did recently? {host: Greg} says yes, though there are four or five Trouble albums he'd rank above The Distortion Field. The band hasn't updated its original sound: an innovative merger of British heavy metal and psychedelia. That's fine by Greg, but he does miss the conceptual heft Wagner gave to earlier Trouble lyrics. Greg gives The Distortion Field a Burn It. {host: Jim} agrees. He needed some head-banging this week, and for that The Distortion Field does just fine. {tag: Burn It}.
