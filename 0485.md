# Show 485: Buried Treasures and Opinions on Madonna

![heartdoctor](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2014/buriedtreasures_web2.jpg)

{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} share some of their favorite under-the-mainstream-radar tunes during this installment of {tag: Buried Treasures}. Then they review the new album from the Material Girl.

## 00:02:23 News: 03.13.15
One of the highest profile court cases in the music industry has been going on for nearly a year and half, and finally we have a verdict. A federal jury in Los Angeles on deemed that {artist: Robin Thicke}, {artist: TI} and {artist: Pharrell Williams}'s 2013 hit "{track: Blurred Lines}" was indeed similar enough to {artist: Marvin Gaye} 1977 song "{track: Got To Give It Up}" to award the Gaye estate $7.3 million. {host: Greg} notes that while it's a huge win for the Gaye estate and one that will impact future copyright decisions, there will surely be an appeal. {name: Howard King}, Thicke's attorney said, "We owe it to songwriters around the world to make sure this verdict doesn't stand."

Pioneering documentarian {name: Albert Maysles} died on March 6th. Maysles, and his brother {name: David [Maysles]}, made a huge contribution to the film world with their {genre: cinema verite} works like {tag: *Grey Gardens*} and {era: 1964}'s {tag: *What's Happening! The Beatles in the USA*}.  But for music fans like {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}, Maysles made his biggest impact with the {era: 1970} rock doc {tag: *Gimme Shelter*}, which showed the {artist: Rolling Stones} during their 1969 {place: US} tour and the tragic death during their concert at the {place: Altamont speedway}. Maysles was 88.

## 00:10:10 List: Buried Treasures

## 00:48:04 Review: Madonna
![Rebel Heart - EP](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music3/v4/dd/e0/0b/dde00bdd-641d-5085-47ca-d4f211fb3f75/UMG_cvrart_00602547303462_01_RGB72_1500x1500_15UMGIM15308.jpg/600x600bb-85.jpg "20044/980472557")

In the early {era: '80s}, people questioned whether {genre: pop} diva {artist: Madonna} was just a girl of the moment or here to stay. While her music has been the soundtrack to our lives, her work in the {era: 21st century} has received mixed reviews. Plus in the {tag: Internet age}, Madge experienced issues when she was forced to release her 13th studio album, {album: Rebel Heart}, early after tracks leaked online. {host: Greg} thinks that Madonna is at her best when she's being introspective, like on {era: 1998}'s {album: Ray of Light}. The more experimental and honest tracks on the latest record outshine the dance pop numbers that are usually her specialty. He argues that *Rebel Heart* is half of a good album and gives it a {tag: Try It}. In {host: Jim}'s opinion, Greg is being kind to the {tag: Material Girl}, and thinks "{track: Holy Water}" is probably Madonna's worst song ever. He perceives the confessional songs as inauthentic and her attempts at provocation as tawdry. He gives *Rebel Heart* a {tag: Trash It}.
