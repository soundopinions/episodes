## 00:01:49 Special: SXSW 2009
On this episode {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} give their annual {tag: South By Southwest} reports. Our hosts head down to {place: Austin}, TX every year to check out new bands and learn about what's happening on the business end of things. While most folks spend their days frolicking at outdoor parties, Jim and Greg go from conference room to conference room to hear about industry trends. One panel Jim attended focused on the state of independent labels. He was struck by the suggestion that indie labels might have to sign artists to deals similar to corporate 360 deals in order to survive. Greg understands why artists who aren't at a {artist: Radiohead} level might want a small support system to get their music made and heard.

Another buzzword at this year's festival is the "{tag: darknet}," which refers to a looming state where data is shared in a closed, unregulated virtual market. Greg describes how industry analysts are looking at the digital music business and see implications beyond the industry. To them, the future of democracy is at stake!

While many {tag: SXSW} attendees fret about product distribution, Jim and Greg attended a discussion dedicated to one single release: The {artist: Neil Young} box set. Fans have anxiously been awaiting such a collection, and this summer they'll not only get Young's music, but the capability to dive into Young's archive and future archive.

Of course, it's not all work at the SXSW Music Festival. Jim and Greg check out as much new music as they can. And with more than 1800 bands playing during the four-day affair, they had a lot to choose from. Now they've returned home with some new favorites for you to check out.

## 00:48:41 Review: Yeah Yeah Yeahs
![It's Blitz! (Deluxe Edition)](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/28/b8/7e/28b87e9e-6f0a-4cf5-a95c-8aa8d9e84898/source/600x600bb.jpg "1265171/306825814")
It was only eight years ago that the {artist: Yeah Yeah Yeahs} appeared at SXSW. Now, they have their third record out called {album: It's Blitz!} Jim and Greg agree that lead singer {name: Karen O} is a stage performer like none other. But, she's only 1/3 of the band. Drummer {name: Brian Chase} and guitarist {name: Nick Zinner} also have a major impact on the band's sound. So, as {host: Jim} points out, it's remarkable that they'd want to "mess" with the two other important elements. Chase's drumming is less frenetic, and Zinner has added synths to his repertoire. Jim thinks the change is not only courageous, but successful and gives {album: It's Blitz!} a {tag: Buy It} rating. {host: Greg} not only hears a shift in sound, but a new sense of introspection. He is reminded of the band's emotional 2003 single "{track: Maps}." Greg also gives the Yeah Yeah Yeahs a {tag: Buy It}.
