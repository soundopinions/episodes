# Show 748: Social Distancing on the Desert Island, R.I.P. Singer and Songwriter Paul K.

In light of the global pandemic, hosts Jim DeRogatis and Greg Kot are encouraging listeners to practice social distancing.

Greg also bids farewell to the late singer and songwriter Paul K. of Paul K. & the Weathermen.
