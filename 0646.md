![Captain Beefheart](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2018/captain_beefheart.jpg)

Hosts {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} explore the legend of {artist: Captain Beefheart}, a musician with a larger-than-life personality who blurred the lines of music, art and noise. Also, they talk with longtime Captain Beefheart collaborator {artist: Gary Lucas} and share their thoughts on why Beefheart's music, however difficult, is of value. Plus, the hosts review new albums from {genre: country} artists {artist: Kacey Musgraves} and {artist: Sarah Shook}.

## 00:01:17 Review: Kacey Musgraves

According to Jim DeRogatis, {artist: Kacey Musgraves} has been recording "basically forever," he adds that, "Shortly after she could walk she started playing the mandolin." On her latest album, {album: Golden Hour}, Kacey Musgraves offers a contemporary {genre: country} album that has sounds that listeners might not expect on a country recording. For starters, there's the {tag: vocoder} on "{track: Oh What a World}" and "{track: Butterflies}," and then there's the {tag: disco} bassline on "{track: High Horse}." Jim says "{track: Mother}" could be on a {artist: Tori Amos} record, while Greg says that the track is a meta-song about "what it means to be a woman, what it means to be a mother." Greg also notes that {track: Rainbow} is draped in "{tag: LGBTQ} colors." {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} give the album a Double {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:07:45 Review: Sarah Shook and the Disarmers
![Years](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/646/CX0.jpg)
Jim and Greg were both happy to find that the new {artist: Sarah Shook & the Disarmers} album, {album: Years}, still has the {genre: alt-county} rough edges that they appreciated on her debut, 2015's {album: Sidelong}. Only this time, Greg notes that Sarah upped her vocal game, approaching a song like "{track: Heartache in Hell}" "like a jazz vocalistâ€¦ living each word, each syllable in those lines." Jim notes that in the song "{track: Damned If I Do, Damned If I Don't}," "she's having these inner battles, and she's doing it in front of a microphone." {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} give Years a Double {tag: Buy It}.

This week, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} take the plunge into the depths of an artist that is notoriously difficult for many music fans to enjoy - {artist: Captain Beefheart}. This writer, singer, visual artist and musician had a larger-than-life personality and blurred the lines of genres like {genre: rock and roll}, {genre: blues}, {genre: free jazz} and more. Beefheart influenced countless artists from {artist: John Cale} to {artist: PJ Harvey} to {artist: Jack White} - who recently reissued Beefheart's most famous record {album: Trout Mask Replica} on his own label {label: Third Man Records}. Jim and Greg go through Beefheart's origin story, discography and importance. Plus they'll talk to long-time collaborator {artist: Gary Lucas}.
