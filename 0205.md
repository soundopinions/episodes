## 00:01:45 News: 10.30.09
The {artist: Michael Jackson} posthumous money grab has begun. The new single "{track: This Is It}" has been released. It's likely to be the final new piece of music from the {tag: King of Pop} and coincides with the release of a greatest hits album and movie of the same name. The film captures Jackson's L.A. rehearsals for what was to be his comeback tour. {host: Greg} saw *This Is It* earlier this week and describes it as a first hand glimpse of the artist in his final days. Greg was surprised to see how sharp and detail-oriented Jackson was, especially considering his frail appearance. Jackson lost some of his voice, but still knew how to make great theater, and Greg believes this comeback attempt would've been a success.

Next in the news, another successful {tag: rapper} is headed for {tag: prison}. {artist: Lil Wayne}, the number one selling artist of 2008, pled guilty to {tag: gun possession} and is expected to be sentenced to a year in prison. He has a new {tag: mixtape} out this week and will likely continue releasing and promoting music throughout next year-especially if he follows the lead of {artist: T.I.} That rapper is serving a {tag: prison sentence} he began in May and is not only still a Billboard Top 200 seller, but recently won a {tag: BET award}.
