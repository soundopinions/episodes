# Show 429: The Sound Opinions World Tour in Russia & Angel Olsen Review

![World Tour: Russia](http://static.soundopinions.org/images/2014/russia_web.jpg)

## 00:02:18 News: 02.14.14
They truly are the champions: {artist: Queen}'s {album: *Greatest Hits*} album just became the first record in history to sell more than 6 million copies in the {place: United Kingdom}. That's about one album for every ten Britons—or, as Jim puts it, a whole lot of {name: Freddie Mercury}'s overbite. 

In more chart news from across the pond, the {place: U.K.}'s top-selling album this week is {album: *So Long, See You Tomorrow*}, the latest from {artist: Bombay Bicycle Club}. Which had {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} wondering… who, exactly, is Bombay Bicycle Club? Apparently it's an {genre: indie rock} outfit known for sampling {genre: Bollywood} show tunes, with the nephew of the late British songstress {name: Kirsty MacColl} on guitar. The Brits must have a thing for the initials BBC.

Meanwhile back in the States, rock fans have been celebrating the 50th anniversary of {artist: The Beatles}' first appearance on {tag: The Ed Sullivan Show}. And for memorabilia dealers, that's meant big business. A chunk of the Sullivan Show set signed by the Fab Four is going for a million bucks, while a signed U.K. version of {album: A Hard Day's Night} is expected to take in $60,000. There's also a signed copy of {album: With the Beatles} floating around somewhere. If you're the owner, consider paying a visit to {tag: Antiques Roadshow}—you're in for at least $45,000.

Funnyman {name: Fred Armisen} of {tag: Portlandia} and {tag: *Saturday Night Live*} fame will soon return to late-night TV, this time as a musician. When fellow *SNL* alum {name: Seth Myers} takes over {tag: Late Night} later this month, Armisen will "curate" his music and lead the in-house {artist: 8G Band}, Myers announced by tweet this week. Sound Opinions saw this coming in 2012, when Fred (a former {place: Chicago} {genre: punk} rocker who played in the band {artist: Trenchmouth}, as well as {artist: Blue Man Group}) [told](/show/327/)  Jim and Greg how he's always admired bands on TV. Live the dream, Fred.

## 00:06:51 World Tour: Russia
Last year, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} racked up lots of frequent flier miles during the Sound Opinions {tag: World Tour} with trips to Sweden, Japan, South Africa and Mexico. This year, just in time for the {tag: Winter Olympic Games}, they grab their passports once again and head for {place: Russia}. {place: Moscow}-based author and music critic {name: Artemy Troitsky} serves as their guide, lifting the shroud of the {tag: Iron Curtain} to reveal Russia's complicated {genre: rock 'n' roll} history. Up until the mid-1980's, the Communist government heavily censored the media, so listeners eager to hear the latest {artist: [The] Beatles} or {artist: [The] Beach Boys} song from the West had to rely on pirate radio stations and an underground market of reel-to-reel tapes. According to Troitsky, the tense environment actually helped push many artists to quietly rebel and make relevant and provocative music right under the noses (and ears) of the government. Inpsired by artists in the West, bands like {artist: Aquarium}, {artist: DDT}, and {artist: Nautilus Pompilius} started making their own music complete with poetic and thoughtful lyrics which fit in nicely with Russia's long, rich literary tradition. After the fall of the {tag: Berlin Wall} in the mid-{era: 1980}'s, media censorship was relaxed some, and many more underground acts rose to the surface. However, for every topnotch band like {artist: Kino}, or talented singer like {artist: Zhanna Aguzarova} that emerged, there were three lackluster pop and *chanson* (a type of Russian country music) acts which specialize in fun and nostalgia. These musical styles continue to dominate the Russian charts to this day, but Artemy says there's still plenty of non-mainstream Russian music to be excited about with rappers like {artist: MC Noize}, electro-punks {artist: Barto}, and agit-rockers {artist: Pussy Riot}, unafraid to challenge the status quo and explore new sonic frontiers.

## 00:44:35 Review: Angel Olsen
![Burn Your Fire For No Witness](http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/20152/homepage_large.737a1388.jpg "426576022/738001888")
From {place: Missouri} to {place: Chicago} and now {place: Asheville, NC}, {genre: singer/songwriter} {artist: Angel Olsen} has been quietly making a name for herself. Now, with her second full LP, {album: *Burn Your Fire for No Witness*}, she's being compared to {artist: Leonard Cohen} and {artist: Patsy Cline}. Jim and Greg agree that this release is a huge step forward, combining wan, contemplative lyrics with truly {genre: rock 'n' roll} backing band. While she may not be a Leonard Cohen just yet, both {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} think that Olsen's lyricism alone deserves your cash: {tag: Buy It}. 

## 00:51:20 DIJ: Jim
This week we looked at the music, past and present, of {place: Russia}. Jim thought about one band that curiously made a splash there: {artist: The Lords of the New Church}. The band was somewhat of a supergroup, with punk pioneers {name: Stiv Bators} of {artist: The Dead Boys}, {name: Brian James} of {artist: The Damned}, {name: Dave Tregunna} of {artist: Sham 69} and {name: Nick Turner} of {artist: The Barracudas}, all coming together to play, what Jim readily admits, a 1980's sound that mixed {genre: punk} with {genre: goth}. While he didn't love most of their output, he really loved the first single that penetrated the Iron Curtain: {track: "Open Your Eyes"}.
