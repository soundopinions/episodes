![All Apologies](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2017/allapologies_web.jpg)

It's good to start a new year with a clean slate – and that can mean apologizing to those you've wronged. In that contrite spirit, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} share their favorite songs that say "{tag: sorry}."


## 00:01:44 News:  Streaming and Vinyl, The Future of Music? 
{host: Jim} and {host: Greg } break down  some of the [music sales figures for 2016](http://www.buzzanglemusic.com/buzzangle-music-2016-report/). Overall, album sales fell last year, while streaming services like {tag: Spotify}, {tag: Apple Music} and {tag: Pandora} continue to grow. There was significant growth in people willing to pay money to subscribe to the services, not just settling for the free versions. And while this points to a future of music being cloud-based and on-demand, the continuing popularity of vinyl fogs the crystal ball. Sales of physical LPs grew 25 percent over 2015.

## 00:48:29 Review: Run the Jewels
![Run the Jewels 3](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/581/28T0.jpg)
{artist: Run the Jewels} formed after {name: Killer Mike} enlisted {name: El-P} to produce his 2012 album {album: R.A.P. Music} and the two men immediately hit it off. Since then, the duo has released three albums, one cat remix record, and [appeared on Sound Opinions](/show/481/). {host: Greg} says that RTJ has upped the intensity with each record, and the latest, {album: Run the Jewels 3}, is their finest yet. Greg finds both of them to be incredibly skilled emcees, providing dizzying momentum to their political calls to arms. {host: Jim} also admires their lyrics, but also notes the album's  production. Musically, Run the Jewels creates an inventively dense sound collage, confirming for Jim that they are one of the most important duos in {genre: hip-hop} today. {album: Run the Jewels 3} gets a double-{tag: Buy It}.
