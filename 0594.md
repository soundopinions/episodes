# Show 594: Spring Record Review Round-Up & Honeyblood

![reviewroundup](http://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2016/reviewroundup17.jpg)

{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} give their take on several of the biggest new records, from {artist: Spoon} to {artist: Mastodon}, in this {tag: Review Roundup}. Plus, a conversation with {place: Scot[land]}tish duo {artist: Honeyblood}.


## 00:01:45 News: 04.14.17
### In Memoriam: Rosie Hamlin
![Rosie Hamlin](https://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2017/rosie-hamlin.jpg)

{host: Jim} pays tribute this week to {name: Rosie Hamlin}, lead singer of {artist: Rosie & the Originals}, who [died on March 30 at age 71](http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7744493/rosie-hamlin-singer-rosie-and-the-originals-angel-baby-dies-at-71). A Mexican-American girl growing up in {place: southern California}, Rosie was only fourteen years old when she wrote the classic 1961 single "{track: Angel Baby}" and recorded it with some fellow high schoolers. After self-distributing it, the song was picked up by {label: Highland Records} and became a nationwide hit. Label disputes stalled her career and the song was her only musical success, but it made a big impact and was covered or referenced by artists as diverse as {artist: John Lennon}, {artist: Lou Reed}, {artist: Led Zeppelin}, {artist: Linda Ronstadt}, and {artist: System of a Down}. 

## 00:05:46 Review: Spoon
![Hot Thoughts](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/eb/26/07/eb26072f-6a74-f61a-53d2-cc2854d90c66/source/600x600bb.jpg "703784/1193362145")
{place: Austin}, {place: Texas}-based {genre: indie rock}ers {artist: Spoon} have teamed again with producer {name: Dave Fridmann} for their ninth studio album, {album: Hot Thoughts}. The result, according to {host: Greg}, is a subterranean {genre: disco} record where everything becomes a percussion instrument, from the guitar riffs to {name: Britt Daniel}'s rhythmic vocals. Alternating between minimalist electro-grooves and avant-garde tracks, it's a great Spoon album that the band has been building toward its entire career. {host: Jim} concurs, highlighting the inventive drumming of {name: Jim Eno} that propels the band. He marvels that Spoon can continously reshuffle the same minimalist ingredients yet always come up with bold new statements. {album: Hot Thoughts} gets a double-{tag: Buy It}.

## 00:12:17 Review: The New Pornographers
![Whiteout Conditions](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/8d/01/40/8d01406a-cbc4-bdcd-00f8-af3f85d9b325/source/600x600bb.jpg "4978498/1196953175")
{artist: The New Pornographers} formed in the '90s as a collective of {place: Vancouver} songwriters, including {name: A.C. Newman}, {name: Neko Case}, and {name: Dan Bejar} of {artist: Destroyer}. Bejar was not available for their ninth album, {album: Whiteout Conditions}, leaving Newman as the driving force. Although he was never a fan of Bejar's work, {host: Jim} guiltily admits he's grown bored with the band. {name: Kathryn Calder}'s vocals are great as ever, and the record is full of "perfectly fine catchy ditties," but it lacks any standout tracks. Jim feels Newman is running on fumes, and gives the album a {tag: Trash It}. {host: Greg} feels that's too harsh, but says it lacks the variety of the band's previous records. Every song uses synthesizers to drive the rhythm and he feels the album suffers from not including Bejar's songs. Greg gives {album: Whiteout Conditions} a {tag: Try It}.

## 00:21:45 Review: Mastodon
![Emperor of Sand](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/2a/e8/12/2ae8122a-ed22-4d0c-e062-23d04655e574/source/600x600bb.jpg "65922937/1195230194")
The {place: Atlanta} {genre: metal} band {artist: Mastodon} has just released its seventh album, {album: Emperor of Sand}. Like previous Mastodon albums, the album follows a thematic concept. This time it follows the tale of a man sentenced to wander the  empty, desolate desert. {host: Greg} thinks the thematic elements work well, along with a slightly "pop-ish approach" with a turn towards melodic vocals. In addition to the smooth vocals, Greg believes their integration of different instruments is extremely strong (tubular bells!). He gives it a {tag: Buy It}. {host: Jim} likens Mastodon's sound to mid-period {artist: Rush}, especially when it comes to their progressive rock sound and detailed lyricism. He thinks it's as good as Mastodon gets and gives Emperor of Sand an enthusiastic {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:27:51 Review: Aimee Mann
![Mental Illness](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/79/d5/95/79d5951c-1066-148c-c90f-94f883a4c029/source/600x600bb.jpg "115825/1188948781")
{artist: Aimee Mann} began her career as the lead singer of the {place: Boston} {genre: synth pop} band {artist: 'Til Tuesday} in the {era: 1980s}. Since then, she's had a successful solo career, most notably with her 2000 album {album: Bachelor No. 2}. She's just released her first solo record in five years, {album: Mental Illness}. {host: Jim} thinks that this is one of Mann's best efforts. He loves her minimal use of instrumentation and thoughtful lyrics. While he's not a fan of the {genre: singer-songwriter} genre, he digs Aimee Mann and gives Mental Illness a {tag: Buy It}. {host: Greg} is also a longtime Aimee Mann fan, and thinks this record is one of her all-time best. Her intelligent lyrics and melancholy vocals make Mental Illness a superb album. He gives it a {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:36:40 Interview: Honeyblood
   {artist: Stina Tweeddale} and {artist: Cat Meyers} are Scottish duo {artist: Honeyblood}. Stina and Cat create music in a vein that, according to {host: Jim}, combines the "crunch and melody" of what was "most inspiring about the 90s {genre: alternative} movement... taking it somewhere new."
 Their album "{album: Babes Never Die}" was one of Jim's favorites of 2016. He adds that Honeyblood's music features haunting melodies that invoke creepy imagery.
The group joined us in our studio to play live and talk about their music.
