## 00:01:53  Review: Britney Spears

![Femme Fatale](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/280/350.jpg)

{artist : Britney Spears} isn't a schoolgirl anymore. Seven albums in, she's now a record industry veteran, which begs the question: is she over? Her latest album {album : Femme Fatale} debuted at {tag : #1}, but with only 276,000 copies sold. That's nothing compared to artists like {artist : Taylor Swift} and {artist : Eminem}. And, as Jim and Greg add, where does Britney fit in these days when you have {artist : Katy Perry} on one end of the {genre : pop} spectrum and {artist : Lady Gaga} on the other? They also wonder where she fits in on her own album, which has 28 songwriters and 13 producers. It's a well-oiled machine, and a very well-produced one, but Britney is almost incidental. {host : Jim} calls *Femme Fatale* soulless and gives it a {tag : Trash It} rating. {host : Greg} doesn't argue with this, but recommends listeners {tag : Burn It} just to hear the top notch production.



## 00:09:20 List: Tax Day Special

No matter what bracket you are in, no one likes paying {tag : tax}es. Nothing makes things more tolerable, though, than great music. So {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} have compiled the perfect {tag : playlist} for {tag : Tax Day}:


### Greg

- {artist : T. Bone Burnett}, "{track : Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend}"
- {artist : Fenton Robinson}, "{track : Somebody Loan Me a Dime}"

- {artist : Barrett Strong}, {artist : The Beatles}, {artist : Flying Lizard}: "{track : Money (That's What I Want)}"


### Jim

- {artist : The Beatles}, "{track : Taxman}"
- {artist : The Kinks}, "{track : Sunny Afternoon}"
- {artist : Johnny Cash}, "{track : After Taxes}"
- {artist : ABBA}, "{track : Money, Money, Money}"



## 00:48:48 Review: TV on the Radio

![Nine Types of Light (Deluxe Version)](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/280/29C0.jpg)

After taking a small hiatus and dabbling in film projects, {artist : TV on the Radio} is back with its fourth album. The {place : Brooklyn}Â  {genre : art rock}ers are one of the best bands to come out in the last decade, according to {host : Jim} and {host : Greg}. {album : Nine Types of Light} is a more optimistic, ballad-heavy album, which normally Greg wouldn't say is the kind of record for him. But it's so layered and substantive that he says definitely {tag : Buy It}. Jim puts them up there with {artist : Radiohead}, and compares the subtle rhythms on this release to that on {album : King of Limbs}. He also praises the singing. {album : Nine Types of Light} gets two types of Buy Its.
