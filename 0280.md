## 00:01:53  Review: Britney Spears
![Femme Fatale](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/34/26/fa/3426faef-e661-6f65-ee33-5570a1870cb6/source/600x600bb.jpg "217005/423015214")
{artist: Britney Spears} isn't a schoolgirl anymore. Seven albums in, she's now a record industry veteran, which begs the question: is she over? Her latest album {album: Femme Fatale} debuted at {tag: #1}, but with only 276,000 copies sold. That's nothing compared to artists like {artist: Taylor Swift} and {artist: Eminem}. And, as Jim and Greg add, where does Britney fit in these days when you have {artist: Katy Perry} on one end of the {genre: pop} spectrum and {artist: Lady Gaga} on the other? They also wonder where she fits in on her own album, which has 28 songwriters and 13 producers. It's a well-oiled machine, and a very well-produced one, but Britney is almost incidental. {host: Jim} calls *Femme Fatale* soulless and gives it a {tag: Trash It} rating. {host: Greg} doesn't argue with this, but recommends listeners {tag: Burn It} just to hear the top notch production.

## 00:09:20 List: Tax Day Special
No matter what bracket you are in, no one likes paying {tag: tax}es. Nothing makes things more tolerable, though, than great music. So {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} have compiled the perfect {tag: playlist} for {tag: Tax Day}:

### Greg
- {artist: T. Bone Burnett}, "{track: Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend}"
- {artist: Fenton Robinson}, "{track: Somebody Loan Me a Dime}"
- {artist: Wu-Tang Clan}, "{track: C.R.E.A.M.}"
- {artist: Barrett Strong}, {artist: The Beatles}, {artist: Flying Lizard}: "{track: Money (That's What I Want)}"

### Jim
- {artist: The Beatles}, "{track: Taxman}"
- {artist: The Kinks}, "{track: Sunny Afternoon}"
- {artist: Johnny Cash}, "{track: After Taxes}"
- {artist: ABBA}, "{track: Money, Money, Money}"

## 00:48:48 Review: TV on the Radio
![Nine Types of Light (Deluxe Version)](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/4f/fd/c7/4ffdc77e-1664-1443-3609-77dc3e515ef8/source/600x600bb.jpg "6562624/429772209")
After taking a small hiatus and dabbling in film projects, {artist: TV on the Radio} is back with its fourth album. The {place: Brooklyn} {genre: art rock}ers are one of the best bands to come out in the last decade, according to {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}. {album: Nine Types of Light} is a more optimistic, ballad-heavy album, which normally Greg wouldn't say is the kind of record for him. But it's so layered and substantive that he says definitely {tag: Buy It}. Jim puts them up there with {artist: Radiohead}, and compares the subtle rhythms on this release to that on {album: King of Limbs}. He also praises the singing. {album: Nine Types of Light} gets two types of Buy Its.
