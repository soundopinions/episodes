# Show 184: Disco & Opinions on Sonic Youth and Dave Matthews Band

Forget what you think you know about music's most maligned genre and tune in to hear {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} reveal the real {genre : Disco}.

![main image](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2009/Disco.jpeg)



## 00:02:19 Intro: Music News

{artist : Pearl Jam} made big news this week after announcing an exclusive deal with {tag : Target}. The alternative band will release a new album along with the big box chain. And in addition they will allow Target to use a {name : Cameron Crowe}-directed video in a series of ads. Pearl Jam has long been known for its anti-corporate and anti-commercial attitude, so this was a surprise to {host : Jim} and {host : Greg}. But, as Greg says, at least they aren't selling the album exclusively through Target -- good news for mom and pop record stores.

The usual record industry story goes like this: Label likes artist, label pays artist, artist makes music. But, in a twist, {label : EMI} recording artist {artist : Joss Stone} has offered to pay her label not to make music. The British {genre : pop}/{genre : soul} singer is apparently desperate to get out of her four-album contract, after making only one of those records. This is one of many blows to the label, which has already said goodbye to {artist : Radiohead} and {artist : Paul McCartney}.

After a six-year {tag : trial}, producer {name : Phil Spector} was finally sentenced this week. The judge showed no mercy and put him behind bars for 19 to life, with a mandatory 15 years. That means that Spector will not be eligible for parole until he is 88.



## 00:09:51 Special: Disco Dissected

{genre : Disco} often gets a bad rap -- silly songs, silly clothes, silly people. But as Jim and Greg discuss this week, the music and the scene surrounding it were much more. Songs like "{track : I Feel Love}" by {artist : Donna Summer} and "{track : Good Times}," by {artist : Chic} are as artful and influential as anything {genre : pop} music has produced. And, as opposed to the exclusive disco world of {tag : Studio 54}, authentic discos and disco music gave a sense of community to many outsiders, much like punk did. You can hear this in tracks like "{track : You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)}," by {tag : drag} performer {artist : Sylvester}.



## 00:40:53 Review: Dave Matthews Band

![Big Whiskey and the GrooGrux King (Deluxe Edition)](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/184/1W50.jpg)

Summer concert kings the {artist : Dave Matthews Band} have a new album out called {album : Big Whiskey and the Groogrux King}. The title comes from a nickname given to the band's late saxophonist {name : LeRoi Moore}. The shadow of Moore hangs over this album, and his death almost prevented its release. Not that the DMB needs to release albums -- they make over $40 million a year from touring alone. But, {host : Jim} has always preferred the band on album to in concert. He doesn't love their rhythms or {name : [Dave] Matthews}' lazy vocal style, but recommends people {tag : Try It}... if that's their thing. {host : Greg} thinks the Dave Matthews Band have finally given us a record worth hearing. It's much more rocking and robust than previous releases. It actually "rocks pretty hard," so Greg gives {album : Big Whiskey and the Groogrux King} a {tag : Buy It}.



## 00:48:01 Review: Sonic Youth

![The Eternal](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/184/2810.jpg)

{genre : Rock} veterans {artist : Sonic Youth} have released their 16th studio album, {album : The Eternal}. With a lineup shuffle and label change, they have returned to form according to {host : Jim} and {host : Greg}. Neither critic hears anything groundbreaking or new, but the {genre : urban surf} grooves are back in a big way. Jim hasn't enjoyed anything the band has done in 17 years, but finally hears some truly great songs. {album : The Eternal} gets a Double {tag : Buy It}.
