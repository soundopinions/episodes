# Show 476: Spoon and Opinions on Divine Styler

![spoon](http://static.soundopinions.org/images/2015/spoon_web2.jpg)

Veteran {genre: indie} {genre: rock}ers {artist: Spoon} return to Sound Opinions for a conversation and live performance of songs off their 8th studio album {album: They Want My Soul}. 


## 00:02:10 News: 01.09.15  

{artist: Taylor Swift} dominated {era: 2014} with her album {album: 1989}, selling 3.6 million copies and narrowly beating out {tag: Disney}'s {album: Frozen} for the top spot. With only four records achieving {tag: platinum} status, not even Queen Bey made the cut this year. 2014 also saw a change in how consumers listened to music, as {tag: streaming} increased 54% and {tag: vinyl} sales were at their highest since {era: 1991}.

Just when people thought they "forgot about Dre", it turns out he was the {tag: highest paid musician} of 2014 according to {tag: Forbes}. {artist: Dr. Dre} made $620 million before taxes, which can be attributed to his success with {tag: Beats} headphones and collaboration with {tag: Apple}. In second place is {artist: Beyonc√©}. Rounding out the top five are boomer acts {artist: The Eagles}, {artist: Bon Jovi} and {artist: Bruce Springsteen}.

For the first time in {place: UK} chart history, the ten best-selling albums of the year were British acts. {artist: Ed Sheeran}, {artist: Sam Smith}, {artist: Coldplay} and {artist: One Direction} all held prominent places on the list, perhaps signaling that there is another {tag: British invasion} on the way.

Sony is reintroducing the {tag: Walkman} to give music enthusiasts a new old obsession. This Walkman has 128 GB of memory and 60 hours of battery life, and the device is competing with {artist: Neil Young}'s {tag: Pono}, another high-fidelity music player. Young says his device does not do anything but play music and argues *that* is what it all should be about.

## 00:09:18 Interview: Spoon
In nearly 20 years, {artist: Spoon} has managed to release 8 albums, all of them worth a listen, according to {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}. That is no small feat. Their latest, {album: They Want My Soul}, is a real expansion of their sound, from minimal {genre: post punk} to a more grown-up soul. {tag: Lead singer} {name: Britt Daniel} and {tag: drummer} {name: Jim Eno} founded the band in {era: 1993} in {place: Austin}, and they talk with Jim and Greg about how they have stayed relevant for so long, working with {tag: producer} {name: Dave Fridmann} ({artist: The Flaming Lips}, {artist: Low}) and calling back to "{track: Jonathan Fisk}."  

## 00:45:34 Review: Divine Styler
![Def Mask - Single](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music1/v4/36/11/cb/3611cb7a-0dc6-1a06-a77c-752bacbd80a0/source/600x600bb.jpg "2893155/977646108")
{genre: R&B} singer {artist: D'Angelo} wasn't the only artist to emerge from an extended hiatus last month. {place: Brooklyn} {genre: rap}per {artist: Divine Styler} also returned with a surprise album in December. {album: Def Mask} is his first new dose of radical {genre: hip-hop} in almost 15 years.  The album steers clear of Styler's previous pseudo-{genre: psychedelic} rhymes and rhythms. Instead, it charts a course for the stars joining the ranks of prominent musical {tag: Afrofuturists} like {artist: George Clinton} and {artist: Janelle Monae} in creating a dense, {tag: sci-fi}-laden sound. Styler's impressive wordplay takes a leery look at today's technology obsessed culture, but despite its dark, neo-noir tone, the album is able to maintain a certain amount of optimism throughout. {album: Def Mask} is an ambitious undertaking that is at times both unsettling and uplifting and it marks a celebrated return for Divine Styler. Both {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} say {tag: Buy It}.    


## 00:51:34 DIJ: Greg
Before getting any further into {era: 2015}, {host: Greg} wants to pay tribute to one last musical talent the world lost in 2014: Pioneering {genre: hip-hop} {tag: producer} {name: Larry Smith}. Often overshadowed in the history books by co-producer {name: Russell Simmons}, Smith played a vital role in shaping the early sound of hip-hop, both lyrically and sonically. Before producing the oft-sampled "{track: Money (Dollar Bill Y'all)}" by {artist: Jimmy Spicer}, Smith co-wrote "{track: The Breaks}" with {artist: Kurtis Blow}. Later, on {artist: Run-D.M.C.}'s first album, Smith pushed for stripping down the production and bringing hard-hitting {tag: drums} and lyrics to the fore with just a sprinkling of {tag: synthesizer}. The epitome of this minimalist approach can be heard on Run-D.M.C.'s first single "{track: It's Like That}," which arguably laid the foundation for many of today's top hip-hop tracks and is Greg's {tag: Desert Island Jukebox} pick of the week.
