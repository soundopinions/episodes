## 00:01:50 News: 08.03.07
First up in the news {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} discuss {artist: Joni Mitchell}'s decision to team up with {tag: Starbucks}. Her first album in almost 10 years will be released on the coffee chain's {label: Hear Music} label. Jim and Greg imagine that the {genre: singer/songwriter} must have been impressed with the success of {artist: Paul McCartney}'s recent Starbucks-released album {album: Memory Almost Full}, especially considering her notorious distaste of the music industry. One group they are surprised to hear has joined the coffee family is {artist: Sonic Youth}. The {genre: alt-rock}ers will release a compilation on Hear Music next year.

Jim and Greg update some stories they've discussed on current shows. The first concerns {genre: pop} star {artist: Kelly Clarkson}. When her album {album: My December} was released a few weeks ago, [our hosts talked about Clarkson's high-profile feud](/show/82/) with {label: BMG} chairman {name: Clive Davis}. The singer appeared to be taking a tough-girl stance and defended her artistic integrity, but now she's trying to lay it all to rest. Check out [her retraction](http://www.kingsofar.com/kelly-clarkson-apologizes-to-clive-davis/). 

Another topic [Jim and Greg covered on the show](/show/82/) is the scrutiny hip hop lyrics have been facing post-Imus. A recent victim is {place: Chicago} rapper {artist: Twista}. {tag: McDonalds} decided to pull the {genre: speed rap}per from its {tag: Live Trek} tour because of his "controversial lyrics." Twista's response is that he's been making the same kind of rhymes for years, but no one cared until {name: Don Imus} said something negative about black women. He also added that he usually cleans up lyrics for kid-friendly performances.

While the gossip pages are filled with celebrities who aren't forced to pay for their crimes, singer {artist: Ron Isley} is no such lucky star. He is slated to begin his five-year {tag: prison} sentence for {tag: tax evasion} next week, but {label: Def Jam} is hoping that Isley fans can convince the government otherwise. They sent out a petition imploring people to "call, fax or email the White House immediately to help the 64-year old cancer sufferer." If you'd like to join in the effort you can call the President at (202) 456-1414, email him at president@whitehouse.gov, or contact the Congressional Black Caucus.

Last week {name: Eric Clapton} held the {tag: Crossroads Guitar Festival} in {place: Bridgeview, IL}, and Greg was there to see the action. He recounts how historic it was to see {artist: Steve Winwood} and {artist: Eric Clapton} play together 38 years after {artist: Blind Faith} disbanded. Greg's other highlights were witnessing {artist: B.B. King} give what might be his final performance and hearing {artist: Jeff Beck} do a beautiful rendition of {artist: The Beatles}' "{track: Day in the Life}." Check out Greg's entire recap [here](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-07-30/features/0707290194_1_crossroads-centre-crossroads-guitar-festival-derek-trucks).

## 00:21:45 Interview: The Effigies
This week Jim and Greg have one of their favorite {place: Chicago} {genre: punk} groups, {artist: The Effigies}, performing live in the studio.  It's been nearly 21 years since the pioneering {genre: post-hardcore} act has released any new material, but on April 12 the band released {album: Reside}, a reunion record that Jim and Greg love, much like that of their {place: Boston} {genre: post-punk} contemporaries, {artist: Mission of Burma}. They explain that the band does not miss a step from where the band left off in 1986. You can hear the songs band members {name: John Kezdy}, {name: Robert McNaighton}, {name: Paul Zamost} and {name: Steve Economou} performed on the show, plus bonus tracks here.

Lead singer John Kezdy recalls the band's difficulties being one of the pioneers of punk rock in the {place: Midwest}. Unlike their east and west coast peers, they didn't have an established punk scene to join or legendary venues like CBGB or Maxwell's to perform in. Now, rather than touring throughout the year, the older members of the Effigies have important day jobs. In fact, Kedzy is an Illinois state prosecutor, a job that he explains is the "easiest moral option."

## 00:43:53 Review: Common
![Finding Forever](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/20/26/5f/20265f82-76ac-fd39-760a-f6c2610b1ad8/source/600x600bb.jpg "64490/261316862")
{place: Chicago} rapper {artist: Common} has a new album out this week called {album: Finding Forever}. This is the former Sound Opinions guest's follow-up to his critically acclaimed 2005 release {album: Be}. Jim explains that this is a big year for Common. In addition to having a successful hat company, he'll appear in a number of movies this year. But, it's music that is Common's priority, and Jim hopes that {genre: hip hop} fans won't dismiss this effort as another conscious record from a "backpack rapper." Common was schooled in traditional lyric writing, and he really demonstrates the power of words in these songs. On the Buy It, Try It, Trash It scale, {host: Jim} gives {album: Finding Forever} a {tag: Buy It}. {host: Greg} also thinks this is a great record, but admits that it will pales in comparison to the groundbreaking {album: Be}. But, as Greg explains, more of a good thing is still a good thing. Common and {artist: Kanye West} have continued their special collaboration which results in an old-fashioned, beginning-to-end album -- something that is rare in contemporary hip hop. He also gives the new Common a {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:50:39 DIJ: Greg
Greg chooses a {tag: Desert Island Jukebox} track this week. Taking inspiration from {artist: The Effigies}' visit, he picked a song from the {place: Chicago} {genre: punk} scene of the {era: 1980s}. {artist: Naked Raygun} was one of the bands that really got national attention, partly because of their intense live set, and partly because of their emotionally charged songs. Greg chooses one such song, "{track: Home of the Brave}," to take with him to the deserted island. In the song, the band plays three terse verses about the outrage they experienced during the {name: [Ronald] Reagan} administration. The song asks the listener to think about what it really means to be the "home of the brave," and both Jim and Greg are amazed at how appropriate the song's lyrics still are today.
