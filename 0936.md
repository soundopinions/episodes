## 00:00:43 Review: Cleo Sol
![cleo](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2023/cleo-sol-gold.jpeg)
{artist : Cleo Sol} is part of the prolific, acclaimed and mysterious group Sault, but her solo career is gaining steam. Her latest release, “{album : Gold}” is a near masterpiece according to Jim and Greg. 

## 00:10:33 Review: boygenius

![boygenius the rest  EP](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/936/HL12.jpg)
{artist : Boygenius} have taken the world by storm since releasing their first full album earlier this year. Their new 4 song EP is called “{album : The Rest}” and Jim and Greg are hoping that title doesn’t indicate that the iconic trio of Phoebe Bridgers, Julien Baker and Lucy Dacus are planning to take a break now. 

## 00:19:20 Review: Cherry Glazerr

![Cherry Glazerr I Dont Want You Anymore](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/936/W812.jpg)
{artist : Cherry Glazerr} has always primarily been the project of Clementine Creevy. On their fourth album, “{album : I Don’t Want You Anymore}” Creevy is maintaining her emotional honesty while also exploring a broader musical palate. 


## 00:25:07 Interview: Sacha Jenkins on Biz Markie
![biz](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2023/biz.jpg)
{tag : Sacha Jenkins}’ documentary “{tag : All Up In The Biz}” is a loving homage to rapper and DJ {artist : Biz Markie}, who was best known for their hit single “Just A Friend,” but did so much more than that in their career. Hosts Jim and Greg discuss how Biz maintained the respect of the hip-hop world while being defiantly himself. They also discuss the legal trouble that his sample usage created and how it forced him to focus on DJing.
