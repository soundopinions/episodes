## 00:01:46 News: 7.05.2013
Certainly there have been a number of gay advocates and gay icons in pop music. But, [many](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/01/arts/music/stars-align-for-a-gay-marriage-anthem.html?_r=0) are calling "{track: Same Love}" by {artist: Macklemore and Ryan Lewis}, the first {tag: Top 40} song to explicitly embrace and promote {tag: gay marriage}. It seems to have captured the country's mood, reflecting growing support for gay marriage in the polls and a recent {tag: Supreme Court} victory for same sex couples. And {name: Macklemore} is a straight man, to boot.

Ahead of its launch of an online radio service, {tag: Apple} has revealed some more [details](http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/06/26/apple-spells-out-itunes-radio-terms-for-record-labels/) about its deal with independent record labels. And it appears they'll be more generous than rival {tag: Pandora}. Of course, the music giant is in a position to do so. But this can't be welcome news to Pandora, which has recently been the subject of some unflattering [headlines](headlines).

## 00:09:09 Interview: Indians
This week {artist: Indians} is in the studio. It's the alter-ego of {place: Danish} artist {name: Soren Juul}. He began as a classically trained musician, but was also schooled in {genre: pop} music by his record-collecting father. So, inspired by unique pop bands like {artist: Pink Floyd}, he abandoned the classics for synths and a laptop. His viral hit "{track: Magic Kids}" caught the attention of critics like {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}, After retreating to the Danish countryside to write, Soren recorded the songs for Indians' debut release {album: Somewhere Else}. He and bandmates {name: Heather Woods Broderick} and {name: Laurel Simmons} perform songs from the album.

## 00:41:39 Review: Black Sabbath
![13 (Deluxe Version)](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/67/29/9d/67299dff-71d4-a847-b803-5c8bcf252d49/source/600x600bb.jpg "165907/633814827")

For the first time since 1978's {album: Never Say Die}, three of the four OG's of metal are back in the studio. {artist: Black Sabbath}'s {name: Ozzy Osbourne}, {name: Geezer Butler}, {name: Tony Iommi}, and {name: Bill Ward} practically invented {genre: heavy metal} in the {era: seventies}, {host: Jim} says, and on the group's 19th studio album {album: 13}, Ozzy, Geezer, and Tony are re-united (Bill's on the outs for business reasons). Do the boys still rock all these years later? {host: Greg}'s answer is a tentative "yes." Iommi still brings those ten-ton riffs, and the onset of old age means that for once, Ozzy has something substantive to sing about (death). Most important, {artist: Black Sabbath} doesn't embarrass itself, and for Greg that's worth a {tag: Burn It} rating. {host: Jim} is not as kind. He faults {tag: producer} {name: Rick Rubin}'s over-compression for drowning out Geezer's bass, and whatever the subject matter, Jim insists Ozzy just sounds awful. He suggests Greg take off his rose-colored glasses and see 13 for what it is: a {tag: Trash It} record.

## 00:50:12 DIJ: Greg
{place: Memphis} {genre: garage rock}ers {artist: Oblivians} recently released their first record in fifteen years, {album: Desperation}. {host: Greg}'s had it on heavy rotation along with the group's {genre: post-punk}-inspired back catalogue. With two guitars, two chords, and a stripped down drum kit, Greg says Oblivians married {genre: punk}'s "last moment on earth intensity" with Memphis's {genre: rock 'n' roll} tradition. He chooses "{track: Viet Nam War Blues}" off the band's 1995 debut album {album: Soul Food} for his {tag: Desert Island Jukebox} pick. It's a {artist: Lightnin' Hopkins} cover about a mother whose son goes off to war. Whereas Hopkins brings a jazzy, poetic sensibility to the track, Greg says Oblivians bring rage.
