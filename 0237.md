## 00:01:52 Interview: Chris Jones 
![Chris Jones](http://static.soundopinions.org/images/2010/ct-chris-jones.jpg)
In anticipation of this weekend's {tag: Tony Awards}, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} invite {tag: Chicago Tribune} {tag: theater critic} {name: Chris Jones} to join them on the show. Jones has been watching the trend of intersecting rock and theater for years, and this year it seems to have come to an apex. All four of the nominees for {tag: Best Musical} have rock roots: *{tag: American Idiot}*, which features music by {artist: Green Day}, *{tag: Million Dollar Quartet}*, which is inspired by the famed recording session featuring {artist: Elvis Presley}, {artist: Johnny Cash}, {artist: Jerry Lee Lewis} and {artist: Carl Perkins}, *{tag: Fela!}*, which is based on the music of African musician {artist: Fela Kuti}, and *{tag: Memphis}*, which tells the story of a rock DJ in Memphis in the {era: 1950s}. As Chris Jones explains, much of this trend is the result of economic interests–a new generation of theatergoers raised on rock and roll are now willing to pay big bucks for Broadway shows. He also credits shows like *{tag: Spring Awakening}* for helping to bend the old musical rules. To Jim and Greg's surprise, Chris enthusiastically recommends *American Idiot* and doesn't think the band's fans will be put off.
