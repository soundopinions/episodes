# Show 479: The True Adventures of The Rolling Stones & Opinions on Lupe Fiasco and Bjork

![Stanley Booth](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2015/stanleybooth_web.jpg)

Last month marked the 45th anniversary of the {artist : Rolling Stones}' notorious gig at the {place : Altamont Speedway}. {name : Stanley Booth} was there to witness it, and he literally wrote the book on it. Plus, we've got new albums from {artist : Bjork} and {artist : Lupe Fiasco}.



## 00:02:12 Intro: Music News

{artist : Sam Smith} and {artist : Tom Petty}: two names you wouldn't normally put together are in the news this week because the Brit's {tag : Grammy}-nominated smash hit "{track : Stay With Me}" apparently shares some similarities with Petty's "{track : I Won't Back Down}." The Petty camp reached out to Smith's camp and settled the dispute by giving Petty and co-writer {name : Jeff Lynne} a song writing credit. But they shouldn't expect a trophy next week, says the {tag : Recording Academy}.



## 00:03:43 Interview: Stanley Booth on the Rolling Stones

![trueadventures](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/479/670.jpg)

In {era : 1969} music writer {name : Stanley Booth} somehow talked his way onboard the {artist : Rolling Stones}' famous {place : America}n tour ending at the {place : Altamont} Speedway. And he didn't just live to tell the tale, he wrote the book on it. {tag : *The True Adventures Of the Rolling Stones*} has just been re-released on its 30th anniversary.  Stanley recounts the events at Altamont which ended in the death of concertgoer {name : Meredith Hunter} at the hands of a {tag : Hells Angel}. This was documented in {name : Albert [Maysles]} and {name : David Maysles}' concert film *{tag : Gimme Shelter}*.  Stanley also shares his impressions of the individual Stones, with this tour occuring at the height of the band's fame (and infamy). After initially bonding over a shared love of the blues, the writer developed deep friendships with {name : Mick [Jagger]}, {name : Keith [Richards]} and the gang. But, he shares, his favorite Stone will always be {name : Shirley Watts}.



## 00:41:38 Review: Björk

![Vulnicura](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/479/1XE0.jpg)

After experimenting with various multimedia projects, {place : Iceland}ic {genre : avant-garde} powerhouse {artist : Björk} is once again focused squarely on songwriting. Her new album {album : Vulnicura} is a heartbreak album, candidly addressing the end of her relationship with artist {name : Matthew Barney}. {host : Greg} loves how she finds universal themes within her personal struggles. As always, Björk uses brilliantly unconventional beats, augmented now by beautiful string melodies. {host : Jim} misses the poppier vocal style of her early albums, but still finds it her best effort in a decade. Both critics give *Vulnicura* a {tag : Buy It}.



## 00:48:54 Review: Lupe Fiasco

![Tetsuo & Youth](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/479/29I0.jpg)

{place : Chicago}  {genre : rap}per {artist : Lupe Fiasco} was written off by some after battling his label for years and earning notoriety for his outspokenness on Twitter. According to rumor, it even took threats from hackers for his new album to be released. But according to {host : Jim}, {album : Tetsuo & Youth} is Lupe at his lyrical best. The deft pop culture references are wonderful, of course. But ultimately it's the tragic evocation of life in poor black communities that moves Jim to tears. According to {host : Greg}, the density and poetry of Lupe's rhymes is matched by the adventurousness of the music, filled with unconventional {genre : jazz}y rhythms. He calls it the rapper's best work since his debut. That makes it a *double* double-{tag : Buy It} in a single episode.
