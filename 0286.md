## 00:01:53 Intro: Music News
Two names making a lot of news in recent weeks are {artist: Tyler the Creator} and {artist: Odd Future}. {tag: Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All} is a {genre: hip-hop} collective that has released a lot of mixtapes and free digital albums in the past few years, and they've been gaining quite a lot of attention and quite a reputation. Their style is characterized by skillful rapping, boundless energy and violent lyrics filled with rape and murder imagery. The central figure is Tyler the Creator, and his new album {album: Goblin} just made it to {tag: #5} on the {tag: Billboard chart}.

So far the shows have been chaotic to say the least. And they also wonder if Tyler and Odd Future can graduate from the {tag: shock tactics} into something more meaningful.

## 00:07:02 Interview: Low

Founding members {name: Mimi Parker} and {name: Alan Sparhawk} are not only band mates, but {tag: husband and wife} and practicing {tag: Mormons}. And after nine albums, they've gained a faithful following, which includes {artist: Robert Plant}. He covered two of the band's songs on his last release {album: Band of Joy}.
