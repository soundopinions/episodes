## 00:01:45 Intro: Music News

Changes are afoot at {place : Cleveland}'s {place : Rock and Roll Hall of Fame}. Not only will {artist : Donna Summer}, {artist : Rush}, and {artist : Public Enemy} take their places in the Hall this April, but the institution also has a new CEO. {name : Greg Harris} started his career at the {name : Baseball Hall of Fame}, and assumed the Rock Hall's top job this January. The appointment earned him a shout-out from none other than {artist : The Roots}' drummer {name : Questlove}, who whiled away his youth combing the bins at Harris's record store, the {place : Philadelphia Record Exchange}. Harris talks to Jim and Greg about the {tag : Rock Hall}'s notoriously-secretive induction process, why he doesn't mind {name : Johnny Rotten} bashing the Hall, and why **{artist : Rush}** fans are the most polite fans in rock.



## 00:11:13 Interview: Tony Visconti

While the performer gets all the glory, sometimes it's the {tag : producer} who shares the guts. This week {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} revisit their conversation with one of rock's great behind-the-scenes men, {name : Tony Visconti}. Visconti has worked with everyone from {artist : The Moody Blues} to {artist : Alejandro Escovedo}, but is primarily known for the albums did with glam rockers {artist : T. Rex} and {artist : David Bowie}. Visconti relays how he was lucky enough to meet both men shortly after moving from {place : Brooklyn} to the {place : UK}; both were relatively young and undiscovered. {name : Marc Bolan} of T. Rex was still performing hippy folk songs as a member of {artist : Tyrannosaurus Rex}, and Bowie was beginning song writing but had no direction. Visconti established long-term relationships with both Bowie and Bolan and helped them carve out their identities. In fact, he was tapped to produce Bowie's latest release, {album : The Next Day} which Jim and Greg review below.



## 00:45:00 Review: David Bowie

![The Next Day](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/381/2300.png)

{name : Tony Visconti} is back with {artist : Bowie} on the singer's first album in ten years: {album : The Next Day}. And both are back in top form, according to Greg. He thinks it's Bowie's most consistent record since the {era : 1980's} and again hears that sweet spot between {genre : pop} music and the avant garde. Jim has always found Bowie something of a charlatan, and can't recommend *The Next Day*. So the gentlemen are split: {tag : Buy It} for {host : Greg}, {tag : Trash It} for {host : Jim}.



## 00:51:25 DIJ: Jim

Recently, our own {host : Jim}'s mood was descending into {tag : Bell Jar} territory, so his wife told him to "Snap out of it, {name : Sylvia Plath}!" So, he looked to another "{track : Sylvia Plath}," to cheer himself up. That would be the 1982 track by {artist : Peter Laughner}. The {place : Cleveland} singer/songwriter worked in the same scene as {artist : Pere Ubu}, and it's a welcome addition to the {tag : Desert Island Jukebox}.
