Hosts Jim DeRogatis and Greg Kot review the fourth album from {artist : SiR}, “{album : Heavy}.” The artist born Sir Darryl Farris is a multi-talented R&B and soul singer-songwriter and labelmate of Kendrick Lamar who had a memorable appearance on HBO’s “Insecure” TV show. “Heavy” is his first studio album in five years and is a harrowing dose of introspection.

Hosts Jim DeRogatis and Greg Kot review the highly anticipated new album from {artist : Waxahatchee}, “{album : Tigers Blood}.” Following the creative breakthrough of her previous album, 2020’s “Saint Cloud,” Katie Crutchfield has further developed her Americana songwriting and arranging.  


## 00:16:01 Feature: Led Zeppelin

Author Bob Spitz has written biographies of figures as diverse as Ronald Reagan, Julia Child and The Beatles. A few years ago, he turned his attention to the next best-selling act: Led Zeppelin. As Bruce Springsteen’s manager during Led Zeppelin’s heyday, he didn’t follow their career closely so he came to the topic with fresh eyes. He documents many abuses of power by the band and their inner circle along with their musical accomplishments.
