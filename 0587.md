It's time to give the drummer some. {name: Clyde Stubblefield}, the masterful drummer in {artist: James Brown}'s band, died on February 18 at age 73. By the late '60s, Brown was experimenting with a polyrhythmic sound with a band driven by two drummers. While {name: John "Jabo" Starks} provided the more straightforward {genre: R&B} beat, Stubblefield brought a melodic, {genre: jazz}y touch. His playing defined the {genre: funk} genre through classic tracks like "{track: Cold Sweat}" and "{track: Say It Loud – I'm Black and I'm Proud}."

Most famously, a few bars of his playing on "{track: Funky Drummer}" from 1970 has become one of the most sampled pieces of music of all time.
