It's time to give the drummer some. {name : Clyde Stubblefield}, the masterful drummer in {artist : James Brown}'s band, died on February 18 at age 73. By the late '60s, Brown was experimenting with a polyrhythmic sound with a band driven by two drummers. While {name : John "Jabo" Starks} provided the more straightforward {genre : R&B} beat, Stubblefield brought a melodic, {genre : jazz}y touch. His playing defined the {genre : funk} genre through classic tracks like "{track : Cold Sweat}" and "{track : Say It Loud – I'm Black and I'm Proud}."
