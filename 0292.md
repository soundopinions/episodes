## 00:01:54 List: Top Albums of 2011...So Far

We're halfway through {era : 2011}, which means it's time to get a jump on the {tag : Best-Of Lists}. Here are {host : Jim} and {host : Greg}'s {tag : mid-year best}.


### Greg

- {artist : tUnE-yArDs}, {album : Whokill}
- {artist : Raphael Saadiq}, {album : Stone Rollin'}
- {artist : Fucked Up}, {album : David Comes to Life}
- {artist : Anna Calvi}, {album : Anna Calvi}
- {artist : The Feelies}, {album : Here Before}

## 00:41:11 Review: Jill Scott

![The Light of the Sun (Deluxe Version)](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/292/1WN0.jpg)

Is {artist : Jill Scott} a contender for the next round of lists? Her new release {album : The Light of the Sun} is the number one album in the country, a first for Scott. The {genre : R&B} singer started as a {tag : poet} in {place : Philadelphia} and has gone on to have a successful career in both music and acting. Since her last release in 2007, Scott has gone through tough breakups of the romantic and professional variety. And that's provided much of the subtext for the songs on *The Light of the Sun*. {host : Jim} doesn't think the level of self-pity is warranted though, especially when the music is so upbeat. He's not used to this tough lady feeling sorry for herself. And more disappointing is her singing. Jim says {tag : Trash It}. {host : Greg} can't believe what he's hearing. This isn't a return to form, in his opinion, but a whole new territory. The record sounds loose and fun, and despite the massive life changes, Scott sounds remarkably resilient. He says {tag : Buy It}.



## 00:48:13 DIJ: Jim

{host : Jim}'s {tag : Desert Island Jukebox} selection is inspired by his television guilty pleasure: {tag : *True Blood*}. While he was disappointed by the season premiere, he loved hearing {artist : Neko Case} and {artist : Nick Cave} duet on a cover of "{track : She's Not There}." But nothing compares to {artist : The Zombies}' 1964 original. It combines beautiful chords and harmony vocals with a dark, sinister undertone. Plus you can't beat those keys or {name : Colin Blunstone}'s {tag : vocals}.
