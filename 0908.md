## 00:00:57 Review: Wednesday

Asheville, North Carolina's {artist : Wednesday} is getting more attention than ever for their new album {album : Rat Saw God}. Combining Drive-By Truckers-style country with psychedelic shoegaze, Jim and Greg compare them to Courtney Love and Yoko Ono.



## 00:08:12 Review: Lankum

Dublin quartet {artist : Lankum} are part of a robust scene digging deep into the history of traditional Irish music and infusing it with modern energy. For Lankum on the album {album : False Lankum}, that means emphasizing drone and avant garde aspects already present in songs that are hundreds of years old. Greg is an enthusiastic fan, though Jim wants more experimentation from the group.
