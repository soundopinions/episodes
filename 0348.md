## 00:01:45 Intro: Music News

Jim and Greg kick off the show by talking to {name : Dr. Bob MacCallum}, a {tag : bioinformaticist} at {place : Imperial College London} (don't worry - we don't know what bioinformaticist means either). Dr. Bob studies mosquito DNA during the day, but by night, he's the guru behind {tag : Darwin Tunes}, a site that explores how music might evolve if exposed to the pressures of Darwinian natural selection. At [darwintunes.org](http://www.darwintunes.org), users decide which randomly generated musical loops are melodious and "fit" enough to survive and mingle their musical DNA with other loops. "Musical sex" (Bob's words - not ours) results in baby loops, which can be surprisingly catchy. No, chances are the next {artist : Skrillex} record won't be made this way, but as elevator music, it's not bad.

## 00:07:42 Interview: Lydia Loveless

{genre : Country} and {genre : punk} might seem like strange musical bedfellows, but don't tell that to {artist : Lydia Loveless}. On her new record {album : Indestructible Machine}, the rising {genre : alt-country} star sings country songs about small town life, drinking too much, and cheating partners with a punk rock snarl. She performs a few of those tracks live in the studio this week. Lydia's embrace of country and punk has a lot to do with her upbringing. She grew up in {place : Coshocton}, a small town in rural {place : Ohio} where her dad booked country bands. By the time she was thirteen she was playing {era : new wave} music in {place : Columbus} bars with her sisters. Lydia chafed at her parochial surroundings as a teen, and that angst continues to inform her songwriting. If nothing else, Coshocton provided Lydia with ample material. Just take a listen to her performance of "{track : Steve Earle}," a tune about her hometown stalker.



## 00:41:18 Review: Misson of Burma

![Unsound](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/348/1WU0.jpg)

Next up, Jim and Greg review {album : Unsound}, the new record from {place : Boston} post-punk pioneers {artist : Mission of Burma}. Mission of Burma in its first incarnation was sadly short-lived. Guitarist Roger Miller's tinnitus ended the band pre-maturely after just one album and one EP of avant-garde noise and pop melody. The reunited Burma has already produced four times as much material as the original, most of it - to fans' delight - just as good as the old stuff. Does the trend continue on Unsound? {host : Jim} says absolutely. Four albums into their reunion, Burma has proved itself the equal of contemporaries {artist : Wire}. The songs on Unsound are consistently good, and band members continue to experiment by switching up the instrumentation. Key for both Jim and {host : Greg} is that the members of Burma still seem to be having fun. Unsound gets a double {tag : Buy It}.



## 00:48:16 Review: Passion Pit

![Gossamer](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/348/28G0.jpg)

{name : Michael Angelakos}, the laptop wizard behind electropop band {artist : Passion Pit}, first made a splash on {tag : MySpace} in 2008 with the hit "{track : Sleepyhead}." He released his debut album, {album : Manners}, the next year. Since then we haven't heard much from him. Passion Pit's new sophomore effort, {album : Gossamer}, was in the works for some time, and Angelakos recently posted on the band's website that he was calling off performances in July in order to deal with mental health problems. Mental health issues, the stresses of maintaining a marriage, and economic decline all make up the rather dark background of Gossamer, an album that masquerades as a lighthearted dance record. For {host : Jim} and {host : Greg}, that contrast of light and dark is all too good. Jim says Angelakos's lyrics wouldn't be out of place on a soul album. He includes Passion Pit  as part of a movement of weird soul geniuses ({artist : Frank Ocean} and {artist : The Weeknd} are also among them) making heart-felt epics in their bedrooms. Both Jim and Greg agree this is a deep record worth spending some time with. Another double {tag : Buy It}.
