## 00:01:47 News: 5.03.2013
{artist: George Jones} was one of the greatest voices in 20th century music. Period. So even non-{genre: country} fans will miss {place: Texas} singer, who died recently at age 81. "No Show Jones" had a long, very public battle with alcoholism. And he was no stranger to divorce. But when he sang about these issues, it was never corn pone clich'es. As {host: Greg} explains, George was nothing if not authentic. And that's what made his relationship to fans so strong. To say goodbye to George Jones, {host: Jim} and Greg play what many believe is the best country song ever written: "{track: He Stopped Loving Her Today}."

## 00:07:06 World Tour: Japan
Two months ago, Jim and Greg kicked off the {place: Sound Opinions World Tour} with a musical survey of pop powerhouse [Sweden](show/379). This week, our series on global {genre: rock} and {genre: pop} continues with a stop in {place: Japan}. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} recruit {place: Tokyo}-based music journalist and podcaster {name: Daniel Robson} to be their guide through the contemporary Japanese music scene. As Daniel explains, it's a scene that's at once similar and very different from that of the Americans and Europeans. Consider this: the Japanese music industry is still profitable, and physical sales still outpace digital. That's in large part to the stranglehold {genre: J-pop} production companies have on the domestic market. But for every saccharine commercial confection like {artist: AKB48}, Daniel says there's an underground group sure to thrill indie ears. {artist: Mamadrive} and {artist: Shinsei Kamattechan} are just two bands poised for Western success in the tradition of Japanese experimenters like {artist: Boris}, {artist: Melt Banana}, {artist: Acid Mothers Temple}, and {artist: The Boredoms}. Another point of difference with the West? Japanese musicians are roughly 50% women. Today singers like {artist: Shiina Ringo} and {artist: Kyary Pamyu Pamyu} carry on the tradition of eclectic rock and J-pop pioneered by all-women groups from {artist: Shonen Knife} to {artist: Puffy AmiYumi}.

## 00:44:15 Review: Jessie Ware
![Devotion](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/388/21R0.jpg)

UK singer {artist: Jessie Ware} has slowly been making her way stateside, first with buzz from tracks like "{track: Wildest Moments}" and then with a {place: U.S.} tour. Now her album {album: Devotion} is getting a proper American release with bonus tracks. {host: Greg} loves the shadow play of her {tag: vocals} and chiming {tag: keyboards} and hears a little {genre: reggae} in the mix. But for him the key is restraint, with Jessie demonstrating that it's a choice, not a limitation. She can belt it when needed, but overall it's a beautiful, subtle record. {host: Jim} loves the new {genre: R&B} palette and is excited by this trend that also includes {artist: The Weeknd} and {artist: Rhye}. Devotion gets a double {tag: Buy It}.

##  00:50:07 DIJ: Greg
{host: Greg} has traveled by "bathysphere" to the desert island to pop a quarter in the jukebox. And right now he's in a {artist: Miles Davis} kinda mood. Specifically, Greg has been going back to Davis' {genre: jazz-fusion} period and his {era: 1971} release {album: A Tribute to Jack Johnson}. He had perfected his studio language with {name: Teo Macero}, and you can hear that in just a snippet of the almost half hour track "{track: Right Off}."
