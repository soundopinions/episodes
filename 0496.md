# Show 496: Scharpling & Wurster and Spring Record Reviews

![passionpit](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2015/recordreview_web.jpg)

Along with the warm weather, this season brings a new crop of exciting album releases from major artists. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} get you up to speed by offering a review roundup of new releases from {artist: Alabama Shakes}, {artist: Mumford & Sons}, {artist: Sufjan Stevens}, and {artist: Van Hunt}. Plus, a conversation with *The Best Show's* Tom Scharpling and Jon Wurster.

## 00:02:14 Intro: Music News
In {era: 2014}, {artist: Iggy Azalea}'s "{track: Fancy}" was the definitive {tag: song of the summer}. In the past few years, tracks by {artist: Robin Thicke}, {artist: Katy Perry} and {artist: Rihanna} dominated the charts without much competition. And while many {tag: summer} hits are released in the springtime, it's already and a frontrunner for the 2015 song of the summer has yet to emerge. In fact, {host: Greg} and {host: Jim} couldn't even think of many contenders. Could there be no winner in 2015?

## 00:05:04 Interview: Tom Scharpling & Jon Wurster of The Best Show
*{tag: The Best Show}* seamlessly combines the elements of {tag: comedy} and music and subsequently has built up a cult following over the years. The program began on {tag: WFMU} back in {era: 2000} and continues today as a podcast. The hosts, comedian {name: Tom Scharpling} and {artist: Superchunk} drummer {name: Jon Wurster}, call into the show in character, adopting the guise of various inhabitants of the fictional town of {tag: Newbridge, NJ}. The Best Show recently announced its 16-disc box set and live national tour to celebrate its anniversary. {artist: Scharpling & Wurster} join {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} to talk about some of their favorite calls, characters and moments throughout the show's 15-year history.

## 00:21:18 Review: Mumford & Sons
![Wilder Mind (Deluxe Version)](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/496/ZI0.jpg)

{artist: Mumford & Sons} has had a "Judas!" moment with the release of their new album {album: Wilder Mind}...they've gone electric. That's right, no banjos or accordions on this album. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} both feel this was a step in the wrong direction. Greg thought that the band's initial albums and live shows hinted at something interesting with their thoughts on life, love and religion. However with this new album, Mumford has become more generic. Jim has never liked Mumford and feels this album is in the vein of {artist: Springsteen} and {artist: U2}...not a good thing. They both give {album: Wilder Mind} a {tag: Trash It}.

## 00:27:33 Review: Alabama Shakes
![Sound & Color](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/496/19X0.jpg)
{artist: Alabama Shakes} has the sometimes difficult task of topping a great debut album. With its new release, {album: Sound & Color}, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} both think Shakes cleared the hurdle with flying colors. Greg says that the band has really utilized the studio to offer a multitude of soundscapes and Brittany Howard's deeply personal lyrics are a great compliment to the sound which mixes {genre: soul}, {genre: rock} and {genre: blues}. Jim thinks the sound of this album is kaleidoscopic, and, like Greg, gives this album a {tag: Buy It} rating.

## 00:34:20 Review: Sufjan Stevens
![Carrie & Lowell](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/496/1L80.jpg)
{artist: Sufjan Stevens} has developed a huge fanbase of people who love his orchestral compositions and plaintive lyrics. However {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} have never counted themselves among those people. With the release of his new album, {album: Carrie & Lowell}, he seems to have converted Greg. Mr. Kot was deeply moved by Stevens's frank talk about the death of his mother and compares the album to that of the late great {artist: Elliot Smith}. He gives the album a {tag: Buy It} rating. Jim, however, has not changed his mind. He thinks Stevens is boring musically and wishes he wrote short stories and poems rather than releasing albums. He gives *Carrie & Lowell* an emphatic {tag: Trash It} rating.

## 00:44:46 Review: Van Hunt
![The Fun Rises, the Fun Sets.](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/496/22M0.jpg)
{place: Atlanta} multi-instrumentalist {artist: Van Hunt} has flirted with mainstream {genre: R&B} success, but his genre-hopping tendencies have kept him from a wider audience. {host: Jim} thinks that's a shame, as his latest album {album: The Fun Rises, The Fun Sets} confirms that Van Hunt is one of the most innovative voices in {genre: neo-soul} music along with {artist: Kendrick Lamar} and {artist: D'Angelo}. Jim sees both depth and joy in the record. The lascivious, erotically charged moments are naughty, yet never offensive. Van Hunt's musical prowess is on fine display, as he plays every instrument himself. {host: Greg} hears *The Fun Rises* as more narrowly focused than the previous album {album: What Were You Hoping For?} in a good way, showcasing a more uniform trippy {genre: funk} style. For Greg, it's a record that works equally well for headphone listening as for dancing. Both critics give Van Hunt a {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:51:34 DIJ: Jim
Although {host: Jim} is no fan of his new record, {artist: Sufjan Stevens} got Jim thinking about rock music that has a literary vibe. Taken from his 1986 album {album: Element of Light}, "{track: Raymond Chandler Evening}" by {artist: Robyn Hitchcock} is an excellent example of a novel in song form. Not only is the title a reference to the great American crime writer {tag: Raymond Chandler}, but the general mood of the song also evokes the mysterious atmosphere of {tag: noir} fiction. Some Hitchcock fans who were expecting more of his trademark surrealism might have been surprised by the lack of humor in the song, but Jim thinks it ranks right alongside the best of {artist: [Bob] Dylan}. "Raymond Chandler Evening" is his pick this week for the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}.
