## News: mm.dd.yy
    All following paragraphs will be news until the next section is located - in this case the interview. Formatting reminders; any text with **two asterisks** will be bolded, any text with *one asterisk* will be italicized,  and any [hyperlink to some url](http_url) will look like this. Remember to look to the preview panel in the right to see your changes reflected.

### Three pound signs will create a sub-section
- And a list can be formed
- by placing each element
- on a new line
- preceded by a dash


## 00:01:01 Interview: Name_or_Artist
    Paragraphs to follow. Note: if there is a youtube playlist associated with an interview, paste the youtube playlist link above this interview section - it will then define it's own section for the front end. You can see this change reflected in the preview on the right as well. **Note** the timecode used in the section title - this will trigger playback at that point in the user's interface. Always display the extra 00: at the beginning to distinguish it as a timecode vs. just a random time. The example timecode indicates playback at 1 minute 1 second into the show.


## List: Topic
    Description would follow. Another note for editing complicated tags with links and quotes. Say you were to add something with italics and a hyperlink. This would be tagged, surrounded by quotes, and surrounded by brackets for a link. A reminder is FILO, or first in last out, so if you are adding multiple markdown element, the first character you add should then be the last one when you finish - ie.  [*"important"*](http://example.com/)


## Review: Artist
    Paragraphs to follow. Tag the following: Artist, Album, Host-Jim, Host-Greg, and Tag-Burn/Buy/Trash. In the preview, click the gear icon: connect an artist and an album by clicking on an artist circle and a line will start drawing - finish the connection to the album, and the line will be drawn. Do this for Jim and Greg's opinion as well and it will compile a review for the front end. To remove a line, double click it.  Album-Artist connections will automatically query iTunes for album art. If it as able to locate something, it will display above the gear icon. Click on the album you'd like to embed and follow instructions.


## DIJ: Jim_or_Greg
    Paragraphs to follow - no need to pluralize names above, that will be done automatically as necessary

Paragraphs to follow.

## Feature: Hooked On Sonics: Artist
