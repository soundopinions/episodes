# Show 273: The Monkees & Opinions on PJ Harvey and Drive-By Truckers

Jim and Greg dive into the history and legacy of the "Revolutionary Made-for-TV Band" {artist : The Monkees} with writer {name : Eric Lefcowitz}.

## 00:01:53 Intro: Music News

The {tag : Grammy Awards} are usually, let's face it, kind of a snooze, and often a head-scratcher. But this year our hosts are excited about {artist : Arcade Fire} winning {tag : Album of the Year}. Most people, Greg included, were certain {artist : Eminem} would take home the award. It was an upset, and for once, the Grammy voters honored excellence over sales. In fact, {genre : indie} bands won 45 out of 108 categories, but that isn't reflected in the market. Greg also applauds the Grammys for shedding light on artists like {artist : Janelle Monáe} and {artist : Esperanza Spaulding}.

{tag : *Guitar Hero*} has played its swan song. Or should we say swan riff? After a huge five year run, {tag : Activision} has decided to pull the plug on the {tag : video game}. This signals a decline for the music video game genre, including {tag : *Rock Band*}, whose {artist : Beatles} game didn't perform as well as expected. What's the next trend? Dance!



## 00:08:31 Special: The Monkees

Hey, hey, it's {artist : The Monkees}! {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} go ape on this episode with {name : Eric Lefcowitz}, author of {tag : *Monkee Business: The Revolutionary Made For TV Band*}. The three men talk about the band's history as a group manufactured to tap into {tag : Beatlemania}. {tag : TV producers}  {artist : Bob Rafelson} and {artist : Bert Schneider} brought bandmates {name : Micky Dolenz}, {name : Michael Nesmith}, {name : Peter Tork} and {name : Davy Jones} together, and their music was supervised by record {tag : producer}  {name : Don Kirshner}. This was the original {genre : pop} model, giving way to {artist : NSYNC}, {artist : Justin Bieber} and *{tag : Glee}*. But eventually, as often happens, The Monkees began to itch for independence. They went on to write and produce more of their own music and make the trippy cult classic {tag : *Head*}. But for those who want to relive the golden age, rumor has it The Monkees will be "reuniting" (sans Nesmith) this year.



## 00:40:40 Review: PJ Harvey

![Let England Shake](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/273/1VS0.jpg)

Next up, Jim and Greg review the new album by {artist : PJ Harvey} called {album : Let England Shake}. The {artist : British} singer, who came out in the '{era : 90s} with a series of critically acclaimed albums, never repeats herself. And on this record she uses {tag : autoharp} and finds inspiration in war. But sometimes change doesn't do you good. {host : Jim} wishes Polly Jean Harvey sounded like herself. He can't stand her little girl singing voice and the pretentious sound. He gives *Let England Shake* a big {tag : Trash It} rating. {host : Greg} is not as let down, but admits the album is a disappointment. He misses her first person perspective and says the music is not at all well-defined. Some parts are just plain annoying, but a few tracks stand up. So Greg says {tag : Burn It}.



## 00:48:33 Review: Drive by Truckers

![Go-Go Boots](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/273/28X0.jpg)

We've gotten a number of emails and calls from listeners asking, "why no {artist : Drive-By Truckers}?" Jim and Greg admit this group often gets overlooked because they are so darn consistent. They recently released their tenth album, {album : Go-Go Boots}, and it's another winner. {host : Greg} attributes this to the fact that there are two solid songwriters. They create scenes and characters that a novelist would envy. {host : Jim} agrees, and encourages {artist : Kings of Leon} fans to pick up this more authentic {genre : southern rock} record. *Go-Go Boots* gets two {tag : Buy It}s.
