# Show 425: The Beatles  "Tune In" & Bruce Springsteen Review

![Mark Lewisohn](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2014/beatles_web.jpg)

The definitive {artist : [The] Beatles} historian, {name : Mark Lewisohn}, talks about the {tag : Fab Four} before they were legends. His comprehensive new text {tag : *Tune In*} delves into the band's early years in {place : Liverpool} and {place : Hamburg}. And Jim and Greg rekindle an age-old Sound Opinions debate: To Bruce or not to Bruce.



## 00:02:18 Intro: Music News

With the release of {tag : Nielsen}'s {tag : SoundScan} year-end sales figures for {era : 2013}, {artist : Robin Thicke}'s {track : Blurred Lines} has officially been crowned the top-selling single of the year with 6.5 million units. Hot on Thicke's heels were {artist : Macklemore} & {artist : Ryan Lewis}' {track : Thrift Shop} and {artist : Imagine Dragons}' {track : Radioactive} with 6.15 million and 5.5 million respectively. Turning to albums, {artist : Justin Timberlake} claimed the top spot with 2.43 million copies of {album : *The 20/20 Experience*} sold. Though, {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} note that the album's numbers happen to be the lowest sales for a #1 record in Nielsen history.

The report also revealed other interesting trends in the music industry. Vinyl record enthusiasts continued to show the love for {tag : LP}s in 2013 with sales up 33% over the year before. People loved {tag : streaming} their music, as well, but digital sales were down 6%. This has Jim and Greg wondering: is the stream going to kill the download?

Speaking of death and downloads... Last week, Jim and Greg [reported the loss](/show/424/) of pioneering {genre : country}  {genre : rock}er {name : Phil Everly}. Apparently they weren't the only ones mourning. In the week after Phil's passing, fans downloaded 18,000 {artist : Everly Brothers} songs, a whopping 696% increase from the previous week. Dying, it turns out, can be a great career move.

{tag : Coachella} Music Festival has released its full {era : 2014} lineup. In addition to top headliners {artist : Arcade Fire}, {artist : Muse}, and {artist : OutKast} (who are reuniting for the first time since 2007), the desert super-show will feature {artist : Girl Talk}, {artist : Lana Del Rey}, {artist : Motörhead}, {artist : Lorde}, plus two bonus reunions: {artist : The Replacements} and {artist : Neutral Milk Hotel}.

In other live music news, the {tag : NFL} has beefed up its plans for the {tag : Super Bowl} XLVIII halftime show. Just in case main act {artist : Bruno Mars} wasn't enough to satisfy America's burning need for overhyped pop spectacle, the {artist : Red Hot Chili Peppers} will be joining him onstage. What a combination, {host : Greg} laments.

If the Nielsen numbers were any sign, {tag : streaming} music is here to stay. And now another big player is hoping to break into that (already crowded) market: {tag : Beats Music}. Spearheaded by {name : Dr. Dre}, {name : Trent Reznor}, and record exec {name : Jimmy Iovine}, the new streaming service aims to offer a more curated listening experience than its competitors. Rather than using algorithms to help users find music, Beats will rely on experts from {tag : Pitchfork}, {tag : Rolling Stone}—and your esteemed Sound Opinions hosts! But {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} wanted to know how the service compensates artists and labels, something for which {tag : Spotify} and {tag : Pandora} have taken flak. CEO {name : Ian Rogers} explains that because Beats Music won't be available for free, the company will pay extra for each song streamed. With the majority of every subscription fee going toward giving rights holders their fair share, Rogers says that what's good for Beats Music is good for the industry.



## 00:09:30 Interview: Mark Lewisohn

January 10 marks the {tag : 50th anniversary} of {artist : The Beatles} stateside debut, {album : *Introducing the Beatles!*} This was 10 days before {album:*Meet the Beatles!*}, but whether you were introduced to these lads from {place : Liverpool} or you met them, you were hit with a thunderbolt--one that has continued to electrify decades after. So what were these four like before they were fab? Who were {name : John [Lennon]}, {name : Paul [McCartney]}, {name : Ringo [Starr]} and {name : George [Harrison]} as young men, performing in {genre : skiffle} groups like the {artist : Quarrymen} and jet setting to {place : Hamburg} with {name : Stuart Sutcliffe} and {name : Pete Best}? To get insight into these early days, leading up to {tag : Beatlemania} and their smash debut, we turn to leading Beatles historian {name : Mark Lewisohn}. He worked with the band on {album : *The Beatles Anthology*} and now has a new book out called {tag : *The Beatles All These Years, Volume 1: Tune In*}. In its 800 pages, Lewisohn reveals who had the biggest row with Stu (Paul), who had the biggest appetite for {tag : prellies} (John), and most important, who was the biggest stud (Ringo). He also sheds light on John's complicated relationship with women and why The Beatles were so ahead of its time, even in {era : 1962}.



## 00:49:24 Review: Bruce Springsteen

![High Hopes](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/425/2AC0.jpg)

It's that time again - to Bruce or not to Bruce? The age-old Sound Opinions debate continues with the release of {artist : Bruce Springsteen}'s 18th studio album, {album : High Hopes}. {host : Greg} is generally more favorable to Bruce, but felt that the last two decades of records have been letting him down with overproduction and a lack of energy. He thinks {album : High Hopes} continues that trend and gave Bruce a {tag : Try It} rating on our new ratings scale. {host : Jim} says he really wants to like Bruce, but is once again let down by lyrical cliches and bad production. Jim gives {album : High Hopes} a {tag : Trash It} rating.
