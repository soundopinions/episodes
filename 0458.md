## 00:44:15 Review: Ty Segall

![Manipulator](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/458/21R0.jpg)

Prolific {place : San Francisco}  {genre : garage rock}er {artist : Ty Segall} has released an abundance of material during his 27-year lifetime. From {tag : cassette} tapes to EPs to singles, rarely does a year go by without the {tag : songwriter} starting a new band or collaborating with another. Occasionally, though, Segall does step into the spotlight with a solo release, and his latest, this month's {album : Manipulator}, is a real stand-out. {host : Jim} thinks all 17 tracks on the album are uniformly great with their refined blend of {genre : lo-fi}  {genre : psychedelic}  {genre : pop} that harkens back to the best of San Francisco's {genre : 1980}'s {genre : psych rock} revival. {host : Greg} loves it, too, notably for Segall's precise production and successful expression of all his musical personalities. {album : Manipulater} is a sprawling album full of loving melodies, great {tag : guitar} playing, and contemplative lyrics; both critics say {tag : Buy It}.



## 00:50:47 DIJ: Jim

Ever since {artist : Bootsy Collins} visited the Sound Opinions studio in {era : 2012}, {host : Jim} has been thinking of dance band {artist : Deee-Lite} and its hit {era : 1990} single, "{track : Groove Is In The Heart}" which features Bootsy on bass guitar and guest vocals. Many consider Deee-Lite to be a {tag : one-hit wonder}, but Jim is a big fan of all the band's albums, particularly their second, {album : Infinity Within}, which took a turn away from the first album's neo-hippy tone towards the {tag : political} with songs about voter registration, environmental stewardship, and the judicial system. One track, "{track : Rubber Lover}" features the return of Bootsy Collins, and delights Jim with its safe sex message atop {place : Chicago}  {genre : house} mixed with {place : New York}  {genre : rave} sound.
