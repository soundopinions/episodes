## 00:44:15 Review: Ty Segall
![Manipulator](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music2/v4/fa/31/69/fa31694e-03ba-e400-872b-961446b4e1ac/source/600x600bb.jpg "435800519/887490112")
Prolific {place: San Francisco} {genre: garage rock}er {artist: Ty Segall} has released an abundance of material during his 27-year lifetime. From {tag: cassette} tapes to EPs to singles, rarely does a year go by without the {tag: songwriter} starting a new band or collaborating with another. Occasionally, though, Segall does step into the spotlight with a solo release, and his latest, this month's {album: Manipulator}, is a real stand-out. {host: Jim} thinks all 17 tracks on the album are uniformly great with their refined blend of {genre: lo-fi} {genre: psychedelic} {genre: pop} that harkens back to the best of San Francisco's {genre: 1980}'s {genre: psych rock} revival. {host: Greg} loves it, too, notably for Segall's precise production and successful expression of all his musical personalities. {album: Manipulater} is a sprawling album full of loving melodies, great {tag: guitar} playing, and contemplative lyrics; both critics say {tag: Buy It}. 


## 00:50:47 DIJ: Jim
Ever since {artist: Bootsy Collins} visited the Sound Opinions studio in {era: 2012}, {host: Jim} has been thinking of dance band {artist: Deee-Lite} and its hit {era: 1990} single, "{track: Groove Is In The Heart}" which features Bootsy on bass guitar and guest vocals. Many consider Deee-Lite to be a {tag: one-hit wonder}, but Jim is a big fan of all the band's albums, particularly their second, {album: Infinity Within}, which took a turn away from the first album's neo-hippy tone towards the {tag: political} with songs about voter registration, environmental stewardship, and the judicial system. One track, "{track: Rubber Lover}" features the return of Bootsy Collins, and delights Jim with its safe sex message atop {place: Chicago} {genre: house} mixed with {place: New York} {genre: rave} sound.
