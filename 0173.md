## 00:01:49 News: 03.20.09
Fans of the Sound Opinions  "Ticketmaster"  drinking game will be happy to hear what's up first in the news. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} talk to {tag: Wall Street Journal} reporter {name: Ethan Smith} about his piece on {tag: Ticketmaster}'s secondary ticket market and artists' involvement with scalping their own tickets. Smith's example cites {artist: Neil Diamond} concert tickets, which he discovered for sale on the secondary ticket exchange the same day as regular tickets went on sale. But he points out that Diamond, whose manager happens to be Ticketmaster CEO {name: Irving Azoff}, isn't alone in this practice. He believes nearly every major arena act on the road today may be getting in on these revenues.

## 00:08:49 Special: A Merge Records Retrospective
This economy has not been easy on independent labels, as Jim and Greg reported a couple of weeks ago regarding {label: Touch and Go} here in {place: Chicago}. So, it's that much more significant to hear of an indie label going strong for 20 years. This week {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} talk to the founders of one such label -- {label: Merge Records} in {place: North Carolina}. In 1989, {artist: Superchunk} members {name: Mac McCaughan} and {name: Laura Ballance} founded Merge as a way to release their music and that of their friends. Twenty years later, it's still growing and has launched such bands as {artist: Spoon}, {artist: The Magnetic Fields}, {artist: She & Him}, and {artist: Arcade Fire}, who gave the label its first Billboard hit.

## 00:37:12 Review: The Decemberists
![Hazards of Love](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music4/v4/df/ab/b3/dfabb3db-965c-f5ba-ba6c-08ebe197c45c/source/600x600bb.jpg "3205453/716161854")
With their new album {album: The Hazards of Love}, {artist: The Decemberists} are poised to reach their biggest audience to date. And neither {host: Jim} nor {host: Greg} think listeners, old or new, will be disappointed. The songs are typically fanciful and epic, but {genre: rock} harder than ever. In fact, Greg thinks keyboardist {name: Jenny Conlee} deserves an award for her {artist: Deep Purple} stylings. Both he and Greg give the album a {tag: Buy It} rating.

## 00:43:59 Review: Mastodon
![Crack the Skye](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/fb/a1/33/fba13326-c209-2dab-0950-d93c4697ff75/source/600x600bb.jpg "65922937/1218344932")
And just when you thought we couldn't {genre: rock} any harder, Jim and Greg get to their review of {genre: heavy metal} band {artist: Mastodon}'s latest release {album: Crack the Skye}. The quartet also faces bigger exposure with this album, and the question in fans' minds is if they can do it without selling out. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}'s response: definitely. For Jim, {album: Crack the Skye} is dark and disorienting, as metal should be. But, producer {name: Brendan O'Brien} helped keep the music melodic and on course. Greg believes the songs' emotions will help draw more people in, but without sacrificing Mastodon's {genre: hardcore} {genre: metal} roots. {album: Crack the Skye} gets two {tag: Buy It}s.

## 00:50:14 DIJ: Jim
Jim's {tag: Desert Island Jukebox} pick was inspired by a documentary he saw on the summer of '68. He saw the footage of the riots in {place: Chicago} during the {tag: Democratic Convention} in a whole new light because of the reporting he's been doing on the city government's attitude toward live music. The city council is attempting to pass legislation that would severely hinder local promoters. And {host: Jim} couldn't help but compare the image of our current mayor to that of his father screaming, yelling and proclaiming himself "the law." That image was juxtaposed with the {artist: Stevie Wonder} song "{track: Heaven Help Us All}," and Jim thinks it's a perfect choice to bring with him to the desert island.
