# Show 121: SXSW 2008 & Opinions on R.E.M.
{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} have returned from another pilgrimage to what many call the live music capital of the world: {place: Austin, TX}. Tune in to hear their reports of the annual {tag: South by Southwest Music Festival}, including what bands to look out for in the year to come.

## 00:01:45 News: SXSW 2008
{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} always return from the annual {tag: SXSW Music Festival} with more than new favorite bands. They always get great insights into music industry trends. One issue that has been coming up for years now is how the music industry will survive in the digital age. This year Jim and Greg heard an interesting solution. {name: Jim Griffin}, a veteran music consultant, has proposed that Internet service providers charge an extra fee to compensate music {tag: copyright} holders. Jim and Greg disagree about how effective this plan will be, but it's certainly nice to hear solutions coming out of the music industry, rather than whining.

Another major industry figure to speak at SXSW was {tag: Ticketmaster} CEO {name: Sean Moriarty}. In a panel led by {tag: Wall Street Journal} reporter {name: Ethan Smith}, Moriarty discussed how Ticketmaster will adjust after {tag: Live Nation} severs ties and takes away 15% of its business. The ticketing company has plans to get in on the secondary ticket market, which prompts the question: What's to stop Ticketmaster from holding back hundreds of tickets to an event only to re-sell them later at hugely marked up prices? The answer, according to {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}, is nothing. And for consumers who have already been treated unfairly by the ticket monopoly holder, the future does not appear bright.

## 00:08:49 Review: R.E.M.
![Accelerate](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music69/v4/3c/4c/e3/3c4ce36a-2619-45c0-35c2-23a3b57e516e/source/600x600bb.jpg "311145/1095593740")

One of the most buzzed about events at the festival was the debut of songs from {artist: R.E.M.}'s new album {album: Accelerate}. The band played its first show at {tag: SXSW}, as well as {tag: Austin City Limits}. (You can hear their live performance of "{track: Fall On Me}" during the show.) Jim and Greg both saw the {genre: rock} veterans perform and have listened to the new album. So what's the verdict? Jim's feelings are mixed. R.E.M. is a band that has meant a lot to him in the early part of their career, but has disappointed him in the past decade. They've never reached the peaks they did with albums like {album: Life's Rich Pageant}, {album: Murmur} and {album: Automatic for the People}. He thought the ACL live show was better than recent tours, but not amazing. And the same can be said of {album: Accelerate}. They've returned to their roots, but not to form, and {host: Jim} can only give it a {tag: Try It}. {host: Greg} was actually pleasantly surprised to hear the band re-invested again-for the first time since losing drummer {name: Bill Berry}. That was an incredible loss for the other three members, and {album: Accelerate} is the first album in years that can stand up to their earlier work, according to Greg. He hears a renewed urgency in {name: Michael Stipe}'s voice and the emphasis placed once again on {name: Peter Buck}'s guitar. Greg gives {album: Accelerate} a {tag: Buy It}.
