## 00:04:05 News: 07.04.08
First up in the news this week is the federal court ruling against {tag: RMG Technologies}. {tag: Ticketmaster} accused the software company of selling software that floods their web site, preventing other customers from securing tickets. A judge ordered RMG to pay the ticketing giants $18 million dollars and banned them from further activity, but Jim and Greg are sure that there's another software designer just waiting in the wings to pick up with the "scalping" where RMG left off.

{artist: Guns 'N' Roses} fans haven't heard a peep since {era: 1991}'s {album: Use Your Illusion II}, but now parts of the highly anticipated new album {album: Chinese Democracy} have leaked. But, {name: Axl Rose} doesn't seem so happy about it. His label not only ordered the leaker to cease and desist, but he worked with the {tag: F.B.I.} to seek him out and question him. That leaker, known as {name: Skwerl}, describes the agents as Mulder and Scully types, and Jim and Greg wonder why they don't have anything better to do. They think Axl would be better off spending less time and money on alienating listeners and more on making music.
