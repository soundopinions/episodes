![Filmore](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2019/filmore.jpg)

In {era: early '80s} {place: California}, a new kind of music was brewing that blended the {genre: psychedelic} sounds of the {era: '60s} with the modern day {genre: post-punk} ethos. This week, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} reflect on the {tag: Paisley Underground} movement. They'll discuss the prominent bands like {artist: The Bangles}, explore what made the scene so special and explain its impact on {genre: indie rock}. Jim and Greg will also look back at the 1964 hit by {artist: The Shangri-Las}, "{track: Leader of the Pack}," for its 55th anniversary. Plus, they'll review the new record from the colorful {place: Seattle} {genre: punk} band {artist: Tacocat}.

Led by the four crucial bands {artist: The Bangles}, {artist: The Dream Syndicate}, {artist: The Three O'Clock} and {artist: Rain Parade}, the {tag: Paisley Underground} was all about re-interpreting the bright, {genre: psychedelic} music of '60s acts like {artist: The Beatles} and {artist: The Byrds} and blending it with the attitude of the {era: '80s}. They used droning guitars, grounded drumming and far out, but sometimes dark, lyrics to make an impact on {genre: indie rock} forever. Even the inimitable {artist: Prince} was smitten, naming his own estate and record label "{tag: Paisley Park}," working with the Bangles and signing The Three O'Clock! {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} discuss the rise and fall of the Paisley Underground and share where its influence is seen today in music. They also talk about the 2019 collaborative album, {album: 3x4}, on which the bands cover each others' songs decades later.


## 00:36:04 Feature: The Shangri-Las - "Leader of the Pack"
![leader](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2019/leader_ofthepack.jpg)
2019 marks the 55th anniversary of the song "{track: Leader of the Pack}" by {artist: The Shangri-Las}. For one week in 1964, The Shangri-Las sat atop the {tag: Billboard Hot 100}, in front of legendary groups like {artist: The Supremes}, {artist: The Rolling Stones}, {artist: The Kinks} and {artist: The Beach Boys}. While it only stayed on the Hot 100 for 12 weeks, the track's impact has extended far beyond 1964. Sound Opinions producer {tag: Alex Claiborne} talks with writer {tag: Ada Wolin} about her book *{tag: Golden Hits of the Shangri-Las}* and about the group's lasting impact on music and pop culture, as well as their influence over notable {genre: punk} acts like {artist: Blondie} and {artist: The New York Dolls}.

## 00:46:35 Review: Tacocat
![Tacocat](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2019/tacocat.jpg) 
{place: Seattle} {genre: pop punk} quartet {artist: Tacocat}'s fourth album, {album: This Mess Is A Place}, is their first release for stalwart record label {label: Sub Pop}. {host: Jim} first got into the band when a listener [suggested their 2016 album {album: Lost Time} as one of the best of that year](https://www.soundopinions.org/show/553/). He was instantly hooked on the catchy melodies and feminist themes. He finds more to love on {album: This Mess Is A Place}, flitting between slices of slacker life and weightier themes like the death of democracy and climate change. He enjoys the increased emphasis on the backing vocals and harmonies. He cites "What a time to be barely alive?" in "{track: Crystal Ball}" as the line of the year. {host: Greg} enjoys it as well, especially the "deceptively smart" lyrics, which he reads as mocking the jaded attitude of some of their peers. However, he feels it's a little too clean for his taste. He preferred the {genre: garage rock} vibe and biting guitars of the two previous albums, {album: Lost Time} and {album: NVM}.
