## 00:02:16 News: 06-10-06
This week saw a major turn of events for the music industry. For almost as long as rock has existed, {artist: Elvis Presley} has been "The King." He earned this moniker not just for being worshipped by fans, but also for being the reigning leader in record sales. Well, it looks like the king is about to be overthrown...by {artist: Garth Brooks}. According to the {tag: RIAA}, the {genre: country} star is only 2.5 million copies shy of reaching Elvis' record of 118.5 million albums sold. Jim notes that some "fuzzy math" is responsible for this achievement (as is often the case when electing new leaders). Brooks' recent five-CD boxed set, {album: The Limited Series}, has been repackaged and remarketed, and while profits have not been huge, each boxed set actually counts for *five* separate sales. So at that rate, Brooks (and [Gaines?](http://www.planetgarth.com/chrisgaines/)) is sure to catch up to our original down-home legend. Greg is concerned that come Armageddon, when we are judged not by our sins, but by our music purchases, we will all face a very dark fate.

Residents of the {place: Sydney} suburb Rockdale face no less dark a fate. It was recently announced that for the next six months, the music of {artist: Barry Manilow} will be blasted throughout the streets in order to curb the bad behavior of the local riff-raff. The city council hopes that this "[daggy](http://www.wordwebonline.com/en/DAGGY)" music will send the young "[hoons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoon)," who enjoy cruising the streets and blasting their own "[doof](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=doof%20doof&defid=320692)" music, back home where they belong. The idea has been tried before down under with the the un-cool croonings of {artist: Bing Crosby}. But Jim and Greg have their own ideas of musical torture. Jim thinks that the relentless [cacophony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-Vy4VRRO30) of {artist: Lou Reed}'s {album: Metal Machine Music}, would send citizens running. And for Greg, it's simple--he only needs to hear the opening violin [riff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNgJBIx-hK8) in "{track: Ants Marching}" by {artist: the Dave Matthews Band}, and he's gone.

{genre: Soul} singer and keyboardist {artist: Billy Preston} passed away this week at the age of 59. Preston is best known as "T{tag: he Fifth Beatle}," because of the recording credit he received for performing "{track: Get Back}" with the band. But, as Jim and Greg explain, this title overshadowed his other contributions to music. Preston had his own hits with "{track: Will It Go Round in Circles}" and "{track: Nothing From Nothing}", and he co-wrote {artist: Joe Cocker}'s chart-topper, "{track: You Are So Beautiful}." He also recorded with {artist: The Rolling Stones}, {artist: Bob Dylan}, and {artist: Sly & the Family Stone}, and earned the distinction of being the first musical guest invited to appear on {tag: Saturday Night Live}. Greg will particularly remember Preston's pioneering use of the [synthesizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuJVleNkJj0&feature=kp) in songs like "{track: Outa Space}."
