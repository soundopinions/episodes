# Show 553: Best Albums of 2016...So Far

![Best Albums of 2016 So Far](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2016/2016midyear_web.jpg)

We're barely halfway through the year and already there's an overwhelming amount of great new music to enjoy. {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} share their lists of the {tag : Best Albums of 2016...So Far}. Plus, they discuss the "{track : Stairway to Heaven}" {tag : plagiarism} verdict and pay tribute to {artist : Parliament}-{artist : Funkadelic} keyboardist {name : Bernie Worrell}.



## 00:01:46 Intro: Music News

The {tag : copyright} infringement lawsuit over {artist : Led Zeppelin}'s "{track : Stairway to Heaven}" now has a resolution. As we've [previously](/show/546/#spirit)  [covered](/show/465/#spirit), the trust of {artist : Spirit} guitarist {name : Randy Wolfe} sued Zep, alleging that "Stairway" plagiarized the 1968 track "{track : Taurus}." A {place : California} jury didn't hear enough similarity between the songs and decided in favor of Led Zeppelin. And as we wind on down the road from the decision, intellectual property attorney {name : Jeffrey Brown} tells us this probably won't change the legal standard for copyright infringement. Even when the plaintiffs win – like in the "{track : Blurred Lines}" trial – the legal fees are too high to be worth it for anyone but the wealthiest of artists. These cases will continue to be primarily worked out in backroom deals.

## 00:51:04 Intro: Music News

![Remembering Bernie Worrell](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/553/2D40.jpg)

This episode has been all about celebrating the first half of 2016, but {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} also want to acknowledge the many losses the music community has had recently. This week we pay tribute to four more musical greats: {artist : Elvis Presley}'s guitarist {name : Scotty Moore}, {genre : bluegrass} legend {artist : Ralph Stanley} of the {artist : Stanley Brothers}, "{track : Mustang Sally}" songwriter {artist : Mack Rice}, and keyboardist {name : Bernie Worrell}. Worrell was a founding member of {artist : Parliament-Funkadelic} and played keyboard for such bands as {artist : Talking Heads} and {artist : Black Jack Johnson}. He was a pioneer known for using the {tag : Moog} synthesizer to make {genre : funk} music long before the Moog was considered funky. While Worrell's additions to music history are often overlooked, Jim predicts that his legacy will live on for years as artists continue sampling his indelible synth melodies.
