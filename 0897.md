## 00:00:47 Review: Iggy Pop

![Iggy Pop EVERY LOSER](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/897/1B3.jpg)

For his latest album, {album: Every Loser}, {artist: Iggy Pop} is backed by a murderer’s row of big names in rock music: Stone Gossard of Pearl Jam, Travis Barker of Blink 182 and the late Taylor Hawkins of Foo Fighters. Jim and Greg are confused why Iggy continues to make new music when it doesn’t sound distinctive.


## 00:08:42 Review: Ladytron

![Ladytron Times Arrow](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/897/EI12.jpg)

{artist: Ladytron} emerged from the electroclash scene of the early 2000s, but have proven to have more staying power than that short-lived trend. On {album: Time’s Arrow} their songcraft shines through and places them alongside the group they took their name from, Roxy Music. 


## 00:16:52 Feature: Kranky Records

Jim and Greg talk with {label: Kranky} Records co-founder {tag: Bruce Adams} about his book “You’re with Stupid,” which chronicles not only the esoteric music Kranky focused on, but also the last gasp of the major label music industry. Kranky launched artists like Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Low and Deerhunter.
