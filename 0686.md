![Klaus](https://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2019/klaus_v.jpg)

{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} sit down with artist and musician {artist: Klaus Voormann}. Klaus shares his unique vantage point to rock and roll history: he designed the cover artwork for {artist: The Beatles}' album, {album: Revolver}, lived with George and Ringo and was a session bassist on many iconic albums in the {era: 1970s} including {album: Imagine}, {album: All Things Must Pass} and {album: Plastic Ono Band}. Also in the light of the recent {artist: R. Kelly} docu-series, the hosts revisit their discussion about {tag: the artist vs. the art}: whether art can be evaluated separately from the artist's ethics.

Oscar Wilde once wrote,  "There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written or badly written." That is, should we judge an artist's output by their personal morals? Can you enjoy a song, when you know the person performing it has done some despicable things? This question is not new to music criticism. It applies to artists like {artist: Chuck Berry}, {artist: Jerry Lee Lewis}, {artist: Miles Davis} and more contemporary artists like {artist: Pwr Bttm} and {artist: R. Kelly}. The recent {tag: Lifetime} documentary, {tag: Surviving R. Kelly}, has brought a lot of attention to this subject. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} revisit their conversation with journalist {name: Britt Julious} (who has written for the Chicago Tribune, Esquire, Elle, and others) and {name: Mark Anthony Neal} (cultural critic and professor of African and African American Studies at Duke) about whether we can, and should, hold a musician's artistic output to a moral standard.  


## 00:21:48 Interview: Klaus Voorman

[{name: Klaus Voormann}](https://www.voormann.com/) was an artist living in {place: Hamburg} when he followed the sound of live music down into a cellar one night and happened upon his first live {genre: rock and roll} show. He saw two acts from {place: Liverpool} that night: {artist: Rory Storm and the Hurricanes} (with {name: Ringo Starr} on drums) and an irreverent dance band called {artist: The Beatles}. 

The friendship he struck up with The Beatles would alter the course of his life and prove to be lifelong. When they leapt forward into {genre: psychedelia} with {album: Revolver}, they turned to Voormann to create a fitting cover image. That work won a Grammy and a place of honor (in tattoo form) on {host: Jim}'s arm. When {name: John Lennon} started pulling away from The Beatles, he enlisted Voormann to play bass in the {artist: Plastic Ono Band}. {name: George Harrison} and Starr followed suit, trusting their "{album: A Hard Day's Night}" era roommate, Voormann, to provide the bassline on many of their solo albums as well.

His stature as a session bass player grew throughout the 1970's- he can be heard on albums by {artist: Carly Simon}, {artist: Harry Nilsson} and {artist: Lou Reed} among many others. In the early {era: 1980s} Voormann added "producer" to his resume through his work with the German band, {artist: Trio}.
