![Klaus](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2019/klaus_v.jpg)

{host : Jim} and {host : Greg} sit down with artist and musician {artist : Klaus Voormann}. Klaus shares his unique vantage point to rock and roll history: he designed the cover artwork for {artist : The Beatles}' album, {album : Revolver}, lived with George and Ringo and was a session bassist on many iconic albums in the {era : 1970s} including {album : Imagine}, {album : All Things Must Pass} and {album : Plastic Ono Band}. Also in the light of the recent {artist : R. Kelly} docu-series, the hosts revisit their discussion about {tag : the artist vs. the art}: whether art can be evaluated separately from the artist's ethics.

Oscar Wilde once wrote,  "There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written or badly written." That is, should we judge an artist's output by their personal morals? Can you enjoy a song, when you know the person performing it has done some despicable things? This question is not new to music criticism. It applies to artists like {artist : Chuck Berry}, {artist : Jerry Lee Lewis}, {artist : Miles Davis} and more contemporary artists like {artist : Pwr Bttm} and {artist : R. Kelly}. The recent {tag : Lifetime} documentary, {tag : Surviving R. Kelly}, has brought a lot of attention to this subject. {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} revisit their conversation with journalist {name : Britt Julious} (who has written for the Chicago Tribune, Esquire, Elle, and others) and {name : Mark Anthony Neal} (cultural critic and professor of African and African American Studies at Duke) about whether we can, and should, hold a musician's artistic output to a moral standard.



## 00:21:48 Interview: Klaus Voorman

![Klaus](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/686/10C0.jpg)

[{name : Klaus Voormann}](https://www.voormann.com/) was an artist living in {place : Hamburg} when he followed the sound of live music down into a cellar one night and happened upon his first live {genre : rock and roll} show. He saw two acts from {place : Liverpool} that night: {artist : Rory Storm and the Hurricanes} (with {name : Ringo Starr} on drums) and an irreverent dance band called {artist : The Beatles}.

The friendship he struck up with The Beatles would alter the course of his life and prove to be lifelong. When they leapt forward into {genre : psychedelia} with {album : Revolver}, they turned to Voormann to create a fitting cover image. That work won a Grammy and a place of honor (in tattoo form) on {host : Jim}'s arm. When {name : John Lennon} started pulling away from The Beatles, he enlisted Voormann to play bass in the {artist : Plastic Ono Band}. {name : George Harrison} and Starr followed suit, trusting their "{album : A Hard Day's Night}" era roommate, Voormann, to provide the bassline on many of their solo albums as well.

His stature as a session bass player grew throughout the 1970's- he can be heard on albums by {artist : Carly Simon}, {artist : Harry Nilsson} and {artist : Lou Reed} among many others. In the early {era : 1980s} Voormann added "producer" to his resume through his work with the German band, {artist : Trio}.
