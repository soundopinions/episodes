# Show 153: Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds
At a time when most artists start to slow down, 30-year rock vets {artist: Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds} are only revving up. The band recorded one of {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}'s favorite albums of the year, and now you can hear them perform their bitingly funny, dark and raucous {genre: garage rock} live on the show.

## 00:01:45 News: 10.31.08
The first story in the news this week is a sign of things to come according to {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}. They have been reporting on power shifts in the music industry for years, and now they're seeing two giants come together: {tag: Ticketmaster} and {name: Irving Azoff}. For listeners not familiar with that second name, Azoff, a longtime tastemaker and power broker in the record business, is behind the careers of {artist: New Kids on the Block}, {artist: Van Halen} and {artist: Guns 'N Roses}, and brokered the recent deals between {artist: AC/DC}, {artist: The Eagles} and {tag: Wal-Mart}. Now he'll be helming Ticketmaster Entertainment, and Jim and Greg think consumers should beware.

The next two stories showcase two new ways the industry is trying to curb {tag: file-sharing}. As reported on the show [previously](/show/151), the {place: U.K.} is going after Internet service providers, since no one has had much luck putting the fear in consumers. Now we know who will be heading this war on downloading: punk rocker {artist: Feargal Sharkey}. The former {artist: Undertones} lead singer is being unveiled as the chief executive of {tag: UK Music}, an umbrella organization that will represent songwriters, promoters and other members of the music industry.

Back in the States, {label: Universal Music} has struck a deal with {tag: Dell Computers} to provide consumers with a bundle of tunes along with their computer purchase. They believe that if people have legal music on their hard-drive, they won't try to get more illegally. But Jim and Greg don't think this deal factors in the importance of choice. In 2008, with so many ways to hear and consume music, fans don't want label executives curating their listening for them.

A recent survey shows that indie labels still don't have access to radio airplay despite the {tag: FCC}'s effort to equal the playing field. Part of 2007's payola settlement was to insure that 8,400 half-hour segments of airtime should be dedicated to indie labels and local bands. This was to help cease any pay-for-play practices. But, organizations like {tag: The American Association of Independent Music} and the {tag: Future of Music Coalition} are saying that, unfortunately, things are as grim as ever.

## 00:10:05 Interview: Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds
Both {artist: Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds}' new album {album: Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!}, and {artist: Nick Cave}'s side project {album: Grinderman} are big favorites of our hosts. So when given the opportunity to have Cave and his Bad Seeds into the studio, Jim and Greg, of course, jumped at the chance. Cave has been making music, along with poetry, plays and novels, for three decades, and {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} are amazed that Cave has managed to be so strong for so long. And in fact, it's hard to tell that the man behind the dark, noisy and funny songs you hear on the show has passed the 50-year mark. 

## 00:42:41 Review: Lindsey Buckingham
![Gift of Screws](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/9c/f6/5b/9cf65b94-5d51-695d-f1bd-5e70217fa64d/source/600x600bb.jpg "201419/290075434")
{artist: Lindsey Buckingham} has released a new album called {album: Gift of Screws}. It's the third solo album from the {artist: Fleetwood Mac} singer/songwriter, and Greg notes that Buckingham is much more experimental when he's on his own. But unlike with his [previous record](/show/50), {host: Jim} finds Buckingham to be also be much more joyful. He and {host: Greg} are both impressed with the guitar work and give {album: Gift of Screws} a double {tag: Buy It} rating.

## 00:48:56 Review: The Vivian Girls
![Vivian Girls](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/6c/58/3b/6c583bab-f23e-4647-1cda-b065121595eb/source/600x600bb.jpg "289447959/289447958")
The next album up for review is from {artist: The Vivian Girls}. The band is getting a lot of buzz, particularly after the recent {tag: CMJ Conference}. They get their name from the controversial artist Henry Darger, and both {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} think you can hear his themes of innocence and violence in the Vivian Girls' music. The production is extremely {genre: lo-fi}, but the record is filled with wonderfully complicated and short pop songs. {album: The Vivian Girls} gets another double {tag: Buy It}.
