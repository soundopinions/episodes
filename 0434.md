# Show 434: SXSW 2014 & Nick Waterhouse Review

![SXSW 2014](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2014/sxsw_web.jpg)

Back from their trip to {tag: SXSW} in {place: Austin}, TX, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} share their favorite bands from the annual music conference. Later, they review the sophomore album from {genre: retro-soul} artist {artist: Nick Waterhouse}.

## 00:02:27 News: 03.21.14 
Sound Opinions is sad to report the death of {artist: [The] Stooges} drummer {name: Scott Asheton} at age 64. This {genre: punk} pioneer took the rhythms of {artist: Bo Diddley} and the {artist: Velvet Underground}'s {name: Moe Tucker} and piled on the aggression, carving out the sound that would soon define punk, {host: Jim} explains. Listening to him pummel the {tag: drums} on early Stooges albums, it's no surprise that Asheton (whose family couldn't afford a proper trap set) first learned to play by banging hammers on oil cans. Along with his brother {name: Ron [Asheton]} on guitar, Scott was described as the gasoline that {name: Iggy [Pop]}'s match set aflame. Jim and Greg honor the drummer by playing "{track: 1969}" from the Stooges' debut album, a punk inferno that Asheton's brutal rhythms kept burning bright.

It's the double feature that everybody was waiting for… in 1994. {artist: Nine Inch Nails} and {artist: Soundgarden} are teaming up for a summer tour, just in time for the 20th anniversaries of NIN's {album: Downward Spiral} and Soundgarden's {album: Superunknown}. Soundgarden frontman {name: Chris Cornell} says he's always been a NIN fan, and that he'd love to jam with the band onstage—but {name: Trent Reznor} might not be so enthused. Back in 2009, Reznor [took Cornell to task](/show/186/) on Sound Opinions, calling his {name: Timbaland}-produced [solo album](/show/172/#chriscornell) an "impressively bad" sell-out. Maybe NIN will bring on a more [suitable](http://www.stereogum.com/1279942/heres-the-call-me-maybe-x-nine-inch-nails-mashup-of-your-nightmares/mp3s/) collaborator for its next tour.

The {era: 2014} {tag: SXSW Music Conference}, normally a festive event, which brings tens of thousands of people to {place: Austin} every year, will unfortunately be remembered as a tragic one. A horrific car crash early Thursday morning resulted in the death of three people and the injury of many more. Also making headlines was {artist: Lady Gaga}. The pop diva not only performed at a contoversial event for a snack food company, she gave the [keynote address](http://www.fuse.tv/2014/03/lady-gaga-sxsw-2014-keynote-address). According to Gaga, without sponsors, there wouldn't be music events; labels can't afford it. A surprising assertion from a woman who later touted her music industry rebellion. 

## 00:12:03 List: SXSW 2014
The {tag: SXSW Music Conference} in {place: Austin}, TX is in its 27th year, and still remains the place for fans and industry professionals to see a ton of music.

## 00:50:09 Review: Nick Waterhouse
![Holly](//static.soundopinions.org/assets/434/2BL0.jpg "153034252/805664536")
{genre: Neo-soul} singer and guitarist {artist: Nick Waterhouse} made a big impression on {host: Greg} during a performance at SXSW in 2012, but unlike a lot of acts that passed through the annual music conference, Waterhouse had staying power. On his second album, {album: Holly}, the {genre: retro}-rivalist deftly channels the likes of {artist: Ray Charles} and pianist {artist: Mose Allison}. {host: Jim} finds the occasional grittiness of the album appealing, but mostly it's too sterile and formulaic to warrant anything more than a {tag: Try It}. Greg disagrees, saying {album: Holly} nails the snap-and-swing feel of old {genre: R&B} records while tossing a {name: Raymond Chandler}, {place: L.A.} noir vibe into the mix. Waterhouse's first album was good, but Greg says {album: Holly} is even better: {tag: Buy It}.
