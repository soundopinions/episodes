A half-century has passed since America first heard {artist: The Beatles}' eighth album, {album: Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band}. The anniversary, along with a new remix of the album, has meant a deluge of nostalgia and media coverage. No doubt the album is important for its advancement of concept albums and studio production, but removed from the hype does the album hold up? Jim and Greg gave the album a fresh listen. For {host: Greg}, the album is about "sound over songs." While innovative, this is not The Beatles at their songwriting best. He says it is "whimsical" and "charming" and if a new band put Sgt. Pepper's out today, he'd say {tag: Try It}. {host: Jim}, thinks the album's praise is based too much on the context of the political and social atmosphere of {era: 1967} and when removed from that context, the album doesn't hold up. Jim says the song writing is very conservative and the album is largely a "mess." That said, Jim says {track: Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite!} and {track: A Day In The Life} makes the album a  {tag: Try It}.

Greg notes that {artist: Benjamin Booker}'s sound was initially inspired by the question of what would it sound like "if {artist: Otis Redding} strapped on an electric guitar and played in a {genre: punk} band?" The resulting debut album, released in 2014, got the attention of fellow artists like {artist: Jack White}. {album: Witness} is Benjamin Booker's second album, which finds him "inspired by the Black Matter Movement, and by America's changing attitudes in the era of Trump" according to Jim. {album: Witness} experiments with {genre: punk rock}, {genre: glam rock}, and {genre: rhythm and blues}.  Jim loves "the fire in his guitar" and "the vocals", and for {host: Jim}, the album is a {tag: buy it}. Greg says that the album is "terse" and "direct" that "broaden[s] his scope both musically and lyrically". For {host: Greg}, the record is a {tag: buy it,} as well.
