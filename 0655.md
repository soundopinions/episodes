On June 8, 2018, chef, author, television host and more, {tag : Anthony Bourdain} died at age 61. This week, {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} revisit their 2008 interview with Bourdain about his love for food and {genre : rock and roll}.

Anthony, or Tony as he liked to be called, explained to Jim and Greg that there are a lot of connections between members of the food world and the music world, the first of which is simply the hours. Both subcultures are nocturnal pleasure-seekers who often frequent the same greasy spoons and the same dive bars. But on a more cerebral level, music geeks and foodies are both obsessed, both opinionated, and both hate {artist : Billy Joel}. Tony explained that when he served up grub to guests he preferred the tunes of {artist : Edith Piaf}, {artist : Serge Gainsbourg}, and even {artist : Connie Francis}.

## 00:17:03 Interview: Margo Price

{artist : Margo Price} is part of a new generation on the {place : Nashville} scene that infuse authentic {genre : country} roots with strong songwriting chops. Her first album, {album : Midwest Farmer's Daughter} was recorded at the famous {place : Sun Studios} in {place : Memphis}, and released by {artist : Jack White}'s {label : Third Man Records} in {tag : 2016}. Her latest, {tag : 2017}'s {album : All American Made}, encompasses a variety of American roots genres, including {genre : outlaw country} and {genre : soul}, but she's quick to distance herself from ther current trend towards {genre : Americana} music, noting that "There's a lot of people in the mainstream that are being turned on their heads right now, and really grasping for authenticity. I think it's only a matter of time before the Americana/Outlaw bubble bursts." Price joined Jim and Greg for an interview and performance at the Goose Island Barrelhouse in Chicago.
