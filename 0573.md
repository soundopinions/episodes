# Show 573: Turkey Pardons & Remembering Leonard Cohen

Every year, a turkey is saved from its {tag : Thanksgiving} dinner fate by a presidential pardon. In that gracious spirit,  {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} give their own {tag : Turkey Pardons}. They share their picks of lousy artists who still had one redeemable musical moment. Plus, they pay tribute to the great singer-songwriter {artist : Leonard Cohen}.

Gather around the family table for the Sound Opinions annual {tag : Thanksgiving} Show!

- {artist : Chicago}, "{track : 25 or 6 to 4}"
- {artist : KISS}, "{track : Detroit Rock City}"

- {artist : Kings of Leon}, "{track : Molly's Chambers}"
- {artist : The Verve}, "{track : Bitter Sweet Symphony}"



## 00:40:07 Intro: Music News

2016 continues to be an awful year for musical deaths, and we've had four more in recent weeks. First, we lost {artist : Leon Russell}, the famous session player and solo artist who recorded with a diverse roster of artists from {artist : Frank Sinatra} to {artist : Aretha Franklin}. The pianist and singer-songwriter {artist : Mose Allison} also died recently at 89. Allison blended {genre : country blues} and {genre : bebop} and influenced rock musicians from {artist : Randy Newman} to {name : Pete Townshend}. Though less of a household name, archivist {name : Billy Miller} also made great contributions to rock music. As co-founder of {label : Norton Records}, he brought much needed attention to neglected artists like {artist : Hasil Adkins}, {artist : Link Wray}, and {artist : The Sonics}.


But the most significant loss was {artist : Leonard Cohen}. The Canadian singer-songwriter established himself on the New York scene with his debut album {album : Songs of Leonard Cohen} in 1967. That record provided inspiration to filmmaker {name : Robert Altman} on his 1971 anti-western {album : McCabe & Mrs. Miller}, a collaboration that Greg feels is a key part of Cohen's career. Cohen's records, however, were often ill-served by overproduction, with his voice pushed to the rear. It took interpretations bu other artists to bring the songs to their full potential, most notably on the many covers of his most famous tune "{track : Hallelujah}," from {artist : John Cale} to {artist : Jeff Buckley} to {name : Kate McKinnon} on *SNL*. But remarkably, Cohen figured things out toward the end of his life. He played countless shows in the past decade and released some of the strongest albums of his career in his seventies and eighties. In fact, for the uninitiated listener, {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} recommend beginning with his 2009 {album : Live in London} album featuring his greatest songs in new, tighter arrangements.
