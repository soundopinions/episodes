## 00:04:14 Intro: Music News
Music legend {name: Ike Turner} passed away a couple of weeks ago, so {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} took this opportunity to discuss how much this controversial figure influenced the development of {genre: rock and roll}. Most people's image of Turner is taken from the 1993 movie {tag: What's Love Got to Do With It}, which portrayed his violent relationship with {name: Tina Turner}. But, as is the case with countless artists and musicians, even bad people can make great art. Turner was a major music figure long before he met Tina, and many people say that his 1951 recording of "{track: Rocket 88}" led to the birth of rock and roll. Listen to the song, and check out [Greg's obituary of the musician](http://leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com/turn_it_up/2007/12/musical-legend.html).

## 00:12:35 Review: Mary J. Blige
![Growing Pains](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/109/KZ0.jpg)
{artist: Mary J. Blige} is back with a new album that's getting lots of attention. {album: Growing Pains} is the {genre: R&B} diva's 8th album in a career that has seen six Grammy Awards and 40 million records sold. So how does this effort compare? Jim thinks that Blige may have lost some of her edge -- whether that's due to sunnier times or sunnier production isn't clear though. She's known for her honest and emotional performances which often relay tough times. But {host: Jim} finds {album: Growing Pains} a little too sterile. He gives it a {tag: Burn It}. Greg admits that he too was worried about how a happier MJB would sound, but he disagrees with Jim's conclusion. As a singer she has no peer, and {host: Greg} thinks she's gotten even better. He calls Growing Pains another landmark Blige record and gives it a {tag: Buy It}.
