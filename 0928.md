# Show 928: The Paisley Underground (The Bangles, Rain Parade), the Shangri-Las & Opinions on The Hives



## 00:00:00 Intro: Coming Soon

In early '80s California, a new kind of music was brewing that blended the psychedelic sounds of the '60s with the modern day post-punk ethos. This week, hosts Jim DeRogatis and Greg Kot reflect on the Paisley Underground movement. They'll discuss the prominent bands like The Bangles, explore what made the scene so special and explain its impact on indie rock. Jim and Greg will also look back at the 1964 hit by The Shangri-Las, "Leader of the Pack," almost 60 years later. Plus, they'll review the new record from The Hives.
