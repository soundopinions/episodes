## 00:01:44 News: 11.11.2011
{name: Chuck D} is always "fighting the power." This time around he's taking on {label: Universal Music} in a $100 {tag: class-action lawsuit}, alleging that the label has short-changed its artists and producers in {tag: licensing deals} for {tag: digital downloads} and {tag: ringtones}. The suit says that artists are entitled to 50% of profits from digital downloads, and that currently {label: Universal} is paying out as it would for physical product, giving a lower royalty rate and deducting for physical media charges like containers and packaging. The {artist: Public Enemy} {tag: front man} is just one of many artists to take to the courts during this digital music revolution. {artist: Eminem} recently won a {tag: landmark case} against Universal, and previously {artist: Cheap Trick} and the {artist: Allman brothers} {tag: settled} a similar suit.

Members of the {genre: hip-hop} community are mourning the death of rapper {artist: Heavy D} this week. He died Tuesday at age 44. {host: Jim} describes the "Overweight Lover" as larger than life in every way. He wasn't a hardcore rapper, but was full of charm and humor. He also moved over to the film and television worlds, appearing in {tag: *The Cider House Rules*}, {tag: *Tower Heist*} and {tag: *Boston Public*}. To say goodbye to Heavy D, Jim and Greg play his 1991 hit "{track: Now That We Found Love}." It was written by {artist: Gamble and Huff} and recorded by {artist: The O'Jays} and {artist: Third World}, but it's Heavy's version we'll always remember.

## 00:08:15 Interview: Wild Flag
{artist: Wild Flag} was this year's buzzed about debut. But, its members are actually industry veterans. Members {name: Carrie Brownstein} and {name: Janet Weiss} are two-thirds of the pioneering {genre: indie rock} band {artist: Sleater-Kinney}. {name: Rebecca Cole} was a mainstay in the {artist: Minders}, and {name: Mary Timony} fronted the band {artist: Helium} as well as her own solo projects. Brownstein is also well known as one-half of the successful comedy duo behind {tag: *Portlandia*} with {name: Fred Armisen}. She explains to {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} that while the band's pedigree is impressive on paper, they didn't take for granted that this supergroup would necessarily be super. The chemistry took time to develop, but now that it has, Wild Flag's live performance is sure to blow your socks off. 

## 00:44:53 Review: Lou Reed and Metallica
![Lulu](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/d1/eb/5e/d1eb5e8a-1587-2e64-6d99-4b646baa1797/source/600x600bb.jpg "167203/467890760")

In the list of rock collaborations we never thought we'd witness, {artist: Lou Reed} and {artist: Metallica} are right at the top. A pioneer of {genre: punk} has joined forces with pioneers of {genre: thrash metal} for {album: Lulu}, an album inspired by the writing of German expressionist playwright Frank Wedekind. Yep it's as strange as it sounds, though {host: Jim} reminds us that Reed has gone {genre: metal} in the past, and well. But here, he is just talking his way through the vocals. And Metallica isn't doing him any favors. Jim compares their virtuosity to the kind you'll hear at Guitar Center. To {host: Greg} the album is so dashed off and improvised, its sound like raw demos with no actual songs to be discerned. And he's especially critical of singer {name: James Hetfield}'s backing vocals. Greg calls Lulu one big raised middle digit to fans; Metallica and Lou Reed get a double {tag: Trash It}.

## 00:51:31 DIJ: Jim
Not to completely dis {artist: Lou Reed}, {host: Jim} decides to present the musician's softer side during the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox} segment. Reed has an enviable encyclopedic knowledge of rock and roll, and he showcases his fandom in a recent issue of {tag: Rolling Stone}. He talks about one of his, and Jim's, favorite songs: "{track: Save the Last Dance For Me}" by {artist: The Drifters}. The song was co-written by one of Reed's heroes, {name: Doc Pomus}, and Reed schools even our critics by describing the song's inspiration. Pomus, suffering with Polio, is unable to dance with his wife at his wedding, so he jots down the lyrics on a place card (which was later gifted to Reed). The song became a classic, and one Jim wants to take with him if stranded on a desert island.
