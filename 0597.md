The 1967 debut from {artist : The Velvet Underground} didn't sell many records, but arguably no album in the past half century has had a greater influence on rock music. {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} offer a {tag : Classic Album Dissection} of {album : The Velvet Underground & Nico} in celebration of the {genre : art-rock} classic's fiftieth anniversary.

According to {host : Jim} and {host : Greg}, few albums are worthier of the {tag : Classic Album Dissection} treatment than {artist : The Velvet Underground}'s 1967 debut, {album : The Velvet Underground & Nico}. Songwriter and guitarist {name : Lou Reed} teamed with avant-garde violist/bassist {name : John Cale} in the mid-'60s to form the core of the band, joined by guitarist {name : Sterling Morrison} and drummer {name : Maureen Tucker}. The sonic assault of their live performances caught the attention of {name : Andy Warhol}. Warhol provided the funding for their debut album in 1966 and created the iconic banana cover art. He also insisted on featuring German chanteuse {name : Nico} on several tracks.

{album : The Velvet Underground & Nico} was released in March 1967 against a backdrop of psychedelia, the Summer of Love, and {album : Sgt. Pepper's Loney Hearts Club Band}. Its noisy, stark depictions of junkies and sadomasochism in {place : New York City} didn't fit well with that San Francisco feeling, and the album didn't sell. But over the past half century, its reputation has grown to the point that, as Jim and Greg argue, it's become the most influential album in rock history. Each *track* has launched an entire genre, from the {genre : goth rock} of "{track : Venus in Furs}" to the {genre : noise rock} of "{track : European Son}" to the proto-{genre : shoegaze} in "{track : Heroin}." It's hard to imagine bands like {artist : Sonic Youth}, the {artist : Ramones}, or {artist : Radiohead} existing without {album : The Velvet Underground & Nico}. On the album's 50th anniversary, Jim and Greg tell the history of the band, give a detailed examination of each of the album's songs, and share their thoughts on its legacy.
