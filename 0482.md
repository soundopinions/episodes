![Cuba](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2015/cuba_web.jpg)

Sound Opinions gasses up the byplane and makes its next stop on the {tag : World Tour}: {place : Cuba}. Later they review the posthumous release from gospel icon {artist : Pops Staples}.



## 00:02:19 Intro: Music News

This week, successful solo singer {artist : Lesley Gore} died from lung cancer at age 68. The "{track : You Don't Own Me}" and "{track : It's My Party}" singer was best known for her work as a teen, singing about heartbreak and female empowerment. But, while the height of her popularlity hit in the {era : 1960's}, later artists like {name : Dusty Springfield}, {name : Joan Jett} and {name : Klaus Nomi} covered her work. Gore also became very active in the {tag : LGBTQ} community and was working on a {tag : Broadway} show and a memoir before her death.



## 00:07:43 World Tour: Cuba

After stops in countries like {place : South Africa}, {place : Japan}, and {place : Sweden}, the **{tag : Sound Opinions World Tour}** is trekking on. {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} hop over to {place : Cuba}, inspired by the historic changes in {place : U.S.}-Cuban relations announced recently by {name : President Obama}. Their guide to Cuba's influential rhythms is {name : Ned Sublette}, author of {tag : *Cuba and Its Music: From the First Drums to the Mambo*}. Ned tells us that Cuba has been alive with music ever since the {era : sixteenth century}.  Drawing upon its unique ethnic history, Cuba developed a {tag : polyrhythm}ic style quite different from what emerged in North America. Innovative artists like {artist : Arsenio Rodríguez} brought Cuban dance music into maturity during {era : World War II}. The unshakeable rhythms of the {genre : mambo}, {genre : rumba}, and {genre : cha-cha-chá} filtered into the {place : United States}, particularly in the world of {genre : jazz} – {artist : Dizzy Gillespie}'s collaborations with {artist : Chano Pozo} changed music forever. {genre : Rock 'n' roll} and the {genre : blues} also adopted {tag : Afro-Cuban} flavors. Even after Cuba's isolation following the {era : 1959} revolution, the music never stopped, according to Ned. *{genre : Nueva trova}*, for example, a movement led by singer-songwriters like {artist : Silvio Rodríguez} and {artist : Pablo Milanés}, began to fuse revolutionary politics and idealism with traditional song forms. Cuban rhythms also provided the basis for the global {genre : salsa} phenomenon of the {era : '70s}. Today music in Cuba thrives in both traditional genres and in modern ones like {genre : reggaeton}. Though he's not personally a fan of the hit 1997 {album : Buena Vista Social Club} album, Ned was happy to see {place : North America}ns reengage with Cuban artists. With the political changes underway, he expects to see an even more exciting cultural exchange between Cuban musicians and the rest of the world.



## 00:48:04 Review: Pops Staples

![Don't Lose This](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/482/2840.jpg)

Reviewing a posthumous release is a tricky thing. You want to honor a great artist with a glowing review, but inevitably there's always something lacking. {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} agree on this when it comes to {artist : Pops Staples}' final album, {album : Don't Lose This}, released 15 years after it the music was recorded and after the artist died. Having Pops on record so late in his life is like a gift to music fans, but Jim hears his voice deteriorating and compares it to {artist : Johnny Cash}'s recordings with {name : Rick Rubin}. Greg agrees that this isn't Pops' best work or the place to start with {artist : The Staples Singers}. But, both critics hear standout songwriting moments that still resonate today. Indeed:  "Don't Lose This."  The album, produced by {name : Jeff Tweedy}, gets a double {tag : Try It}.
