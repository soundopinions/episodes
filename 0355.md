## 00:41:07 Review: Divine Fits
![A Thing Called Divine Fits](//static.soundopinions.org/assets/355/1WJ0.jpg "540104503/540147194")

{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} are generally dubious of {tag: supergroups}. Too often they're not the sum of their parts. But {artist: Off!}'s visit last week had them feeling hopeful about the debut record from yet another indie supergroup, {artist: Divine Fits}. Divine Fits is composed of songwriters {name: Britt Daniel} of {artist: Spoon}, {name: Dan Boeckner} of {artist: Wolf Parade} (and {artist: Handsome Furs}), and {tag: drummer} {name: Sam Brown} of {artist: New Bomb Turks}. The combination of Daniel and Boeckner, Greg notes, is an interesting and potentially troublesome one. Whereas Daniel is cool and reserved, Boeckner is intense and in your face. So does {album: A Thing Called Divine Fits} live up to its lofty pedigree? Greg says it does. Daniel and Boeckner might bring different personalities to this partnership, but the two are kindred spirits when it comes to production style. Both embrace a minimalist, stripped-back approach to recording that Greg says makes listeners hyper-aware of musical details like the occasional castanet or maraca. He gives A Thing Called Divine Fits a {tag: Buy It}. Jim can't echo Greg's enthusiasm. He says Divine Fits fails by abandoning the most successful elements of its members' previous groups. Divine Fits has all the angularity of Spoon, for example, but none of its driving intensity. It has all Handsome Furs' electronic edifice, without any of the sensuality that made that group compelling. Jim gives A Thing Called Divine Fits a {tag: Trash It}.

## 00:48:45 DIJ: Greg
For his {tag: DIJ}, {tag: Greg} wants to celebrate the 20th anniversary of {artist: Los Lobos}'s {album: Kiko}. In 1992, {genre: grunge} acts like {artist: Nirvana} were shaking up the mainstream, and veteran acts like Los Lobos had to either reinvent or face irrelevance. Kiko, Greg says, was Los Lobos's answer to grunge's challenge. The group started out in the seventies playing a fusion of {tag: American} {genre: roots rock} and {tag: Mexican} {genre: folk}. Kiko saw main songwriters David Hidalgo and Louie Perez moving in a more trippy psychedelic direction, writing lyrics that were so concise, they were almost haiku-like. The band's new sound only really began to gel however when their label put them in the studio with {tag: producer}s {name: Mitchell Froom} and {name: Tchad Blake}. Froom and Blake pumped up the distortion and keyboard effects, and suddenly Los Lobos were walking into a new sonic world. Greg says the album's opening track, "{track: Dream in Blue}," represents the door opening onto that new world. Hidalgo and Perez's lyrics describe a sleeping child who, as she begins to dream, finds herself entering a realm of unprecedented freedom.
