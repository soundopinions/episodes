## 00:01:49 News: 7.26.2013
It's been a rough week for digital music. First {artist: Radiohead} frontman {name: Thom Yorke} and producer {name: Nigel Godrich} openly criticize {tag: Spotify} and boot {artist: Atoms for Peace} songs from the streaming service. The, the {tag: Musicians' Union} in the {place: U.K.} threaten a boycott if Spotify doesn't raise its royalty rates. And now {artist: Aimee Mann} is suing {tag: MediaNet}, which provides millions of songs to dozens of music services. She's seeking damages for "willful copyright infringement."

Sure, we could imagine {name: Bono} going for an  "EGOT,"  but "Commander"? The Irish rocker was recently awarded the country's highest cultural honor: {tag: Commander of Arts and Letters} in recognition of his contributions to the arts and to charity. Rapper {artist: Nas} was also given an unusual honor. {place: Harvard University} has established the {tag: Nasir Jones Hip-Hop Fellowship} as part of its {genre: Hip-Hop} Archive and {place: W.E.B. Du Bois Institute}.

Since its launch in 2008, {tag: Record Store Day} has become something music fans eagerly anticipate. And now they'll also have...wait for it...{tag: Cassette Store Day}! True, there aren't many stores that solely sell cassettes, but on September 7, a number of bands will release special cassettes and artists like {artist: The Flaming Lips}, {artist: Deerhunter} and {artist: At the Drive-In} will reissue albums on cassettes. So breakout your {tag: Walkman} and get [ready](http://www.ebay.com/sch/Personal-Cassette-Players-/15053/i.html).

## 00:09:38 List: Buried Treasures

These artists may not be household names, but their music demands attention. Here are Jim and Greg's hidden gems:

### Greg 
- {artist: Bombino}, "{track: Nomad}"
- {artist: Purling Hiss}, "{track: Water on Mars}"
- {artist: Autre Ne Veut}, "{track: Anxiety}"
- {artist: Waxahatchee}, "{track: Cerulean Salt}"

## 00:48:03 Review: Robin Thicke
![Blurred Lines](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music6/v4/14/e0/ce/14e0cec2-870b-7eff-b3e4-d85ee9937eeb/source/600x600bb.jpg "290491/667140011")
Now it's back to the charts, where {artist: Robin Thicke}'s catchy single "{track: Blurred Lines}" has dominated for weeks (proving once and for all that music fans want more [cowbell](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjsUf_oIgp0)). Before he achieved {tag: YouTube} [ubiquity](http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/robin-thicke-blurred-lines-best-parodies-mash-ups-article-1.1408905), Jim reminds us that Thicke was just another journeyman blue-eyed soul singer. He'd written hits for artists like {artist: Brandy} and {artist: Christina Aguilera}, but failed to gain much recognition for his solo work. He's changed that with {album: Blurred Lines}, his sixth studio album. Does the record measure up to its single? {host: Greg} says no. He loves the "Blurred Lines" groove, but relents that the album's lyrics are full of "single entendre" idiocy. "This is a dumb R&B record," he says, "{tag: Trash It}." {host: Jim} agrees that Thicke's lyrics leave a lot to be desired, but gives him credit for crafting the kind of fun danceable tracks we'd hoped to get from Justin Timberlake's {album: 20/20 Experience}. On the strength of "Blurred Lines" alone, Jim says {tag: Burn It}.
