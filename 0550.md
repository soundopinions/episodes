![Eleanor Friedberger](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2016/eleanorfriedberger_web.jpg)

After making her mark in the indie duo {artist: The Fiery Furnaces}, singer-songwriter {artist: Eleanor Friedberger} launched a solo career blending her former band's experimentalism with classic {era: '70s} sounds. She joins {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} for a conversation and live performance. Plus, a review of the new mixtape from {place: Chicago} {genre: hip-hop} artist {artist: Chance the Rapper}.


## 00:02:16 Intro: Music News
![ABBA](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2016/abba_2016.jpg)
Rumors are swirling that {tag: Swedish} {genre: pop} powerhouse {artist: ABBA} is in talks to reunite after all four members were seen together last weekend. During a gala to celebrate the 50th anniversary of {name: Björn Ulvaeus} and {name: Benny Andersson}'s music partnership, {name: Agnetha Fältskog} and {name: Anni-Frid Lyngstad} made an appearance singing their song "{track: The Way Old Friends Do}." The band broke up seemingly for good in {era: 1982} and despite millions of dollars in offers; ABBA has rejected the idea of a possible reunion tour. Not to quash fans' hopes, but Swedish music historian {tag: Carl Magnus Palm} believes there is a 99.9% chance ABBA will not reunite, noting that the foursome didn't actually all *sing* together the other night.

## 00:03:48 Interview: Eleanor Friedberger

{tag: Singer-songwriter} {artist: Eleanor Friedberger} [last joined us in 2008](/show/110/) as one half of the duo {artist: The Fiery Furnaces}, along with her older brother {name: Matthew [Friedberger]}. Famous for their fragmented and {genre: experimental} sound, they made an impressive nine albums in six years together. However since {era: 2011}, Eleanor has been pursuing a solo career that is sonically quite different from the work she was doing in The Fiery Furnaces. She's put out three albums, {album: Last Summer} (2011), {album: Personal Record} (2013) and most recently, {album: New View}. While Eleanor Friedberger is an {place: Oak Park}, {place: Illinois} native currently living in {place: New York state}, she recently joined {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} during the {tag: SXSW Music Conference} in {place: Austin, Texas} for a conversation and live performance in front of an audience at the {tag: Gibson Showroom}. She speaks about growing up, going solo, {name: Seth Meyers}, and {name: Andy Warhol}.


## 00:43:57 Review: Chance the Rapper
![Chance](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2016/chance3.jpg)
{place: Chicago} artist {artist: Chance the Rapper} recently released his third mixtape, {album: Coloring Book}. And while he's at the forefront of the {genre: rap} genre, he's never actually sold a single album. That's because all three of his mixtape releases, as well as two collaborative albums, can be downloaded for free from the Internet. On *Coloring Book*, Chance enlists a slew of popular guest stars, from fellow Chicagoan {artist: Kanye West} to the man of the moment, {artist: Justin Bieber}. {host: Jim} really enjoyed this record, especially Chance's use of {genre: gospel} music to empower individuals and generate a sense of community in order to combat violence. While he doesn't think it is quite as good as his last release, {album: Acid Rap}, Jim strongly believes the music and lyrical insight on this album is equal parts impressive and inspiring. He gives it a {tag: Buy It}. {host: Greg} agrees, saying that *Coloring Book* is one of the most ambitious records in {genre: hip hop} right now. He even points out that West's recent album, {album: The Life of Pablo}, wouldn't be what it is without Chance's gospel sound influence. Greg appreciates the larger themes of the album and how it connects so well to the music of the {tag: Civil Rights Movement}. It's a Double Buy It for *Coloring Book*.


## 00:50:43 DIJ: Jim
It has become a sad cliché at this point that 2016 has been a terrible year for losses in the music world. This week, {host: Jim} pays tribute to {artist: Candye Kane} – an artist less famous than {artist: Prince} or {artist: [David] Bowie}, but every bit as exceptional. She came out of the {place: Los Angeles} {genre: punk} scene, but wore many hats throughout her life: {tag: feminist}, porn star, bisexual, fat activist – and big, bold, and brash {genre: blues} singer. Over dozens of albums, she showcased her power, raunchiness, humor and an unforgettable voice. Kane died on May 6 from pancreatic cancer at age 54. In her honor, Jim nominates her 2000 anthem "{track: I'm the Toughest Girl Alive}" for the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}.
