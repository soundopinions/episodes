# Show 423: 2013 Mixtapes & Ask the Critic

![Mixtapes for 2013](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2013/mixtapes_web.jpg)

{host : Jim} and {host : Greg} bid a final farewell to 2013 with Mixtapes featuring their favorite songs of the year. And they take questions from listeners during the "Ask the Critic" segment.



## 00:01:45 Special: Ask the Critic

- In the {era : New Year}  {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} resolve to answer more of your questions starting with Pete who asks, "How do you tell the difference between and album that's bad, and one that just isn't made for you?" Lee on {tag : Facebook} adds, "Can you fairly review an artist you may think sucks. (This is meant as a serious question)."

To make a long story short...yes (if you're a good critic). See Greg's {artist : Yanni} reporting below.

- Thomas in {place : Maine} leaves a voicemail asking about the best psychedelic bands of 2013. Greg recommends {artist : Wooden Shjips}, {artist : Darkside}, {artist : The Warlocks} and {artist : Besnard Lakes}.
- Jonathan asks on {tag : Facebook}, "Why such a preference for the underground?"

Jim doesn't think they really have such a preference, especially now that underground music is so accessible online. But Greg admits that mainstream, major label acts are expected to appeal to as large a population as possible, and that often means buffing out the good edges.

- "Chili Mac Klein" also posts: "How awkward is it to have to meet with a musician after you have slammed his/her work in the past?"

Greg describes an interesting conversation with {artist : Neil Young} in which he asks the singer why he kept doing [this](http://songmeanings.com/songs/view/126058/). But, for the most part, artists are good sports, especially if a critic does his or her homework and gives critiques with confidence.

We want to hear from you, too! [Post](http://www.facebook.com/soundopinions), [Tweet](https://twitter.com/soundopinions), [Email](interact@soundopinions.org) or Call 888.859.1800.
