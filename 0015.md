# Show 15: A History of the Hip Hop Generation & Reviews of David Gilmour and Goldfrapp
This week on Sound Opinions, Jim and Greg talk with {name: Jeff Chang}, author of *Can't Stop Won't Stop: A History of the Hip-Hop Generation*, about the present and future states of hip-hop. They'll also review the new albums by {artist: Pink Floyd} alum {artist: David Gilmour} and {genre: electro-pop} duo {artist: Goldfrapp}.

## 00:02:12 News: 03.25.06
In the news this week was {artist: Three Six Mafia}'s historic win for  "Best Song"  at the Academy Awards. Jordan "{artist: Juicy J}" Houston and Paul "{artist: DJ Paul}" Beauregard won for their song, "{track: It's Hard Out There for a Pimp}," from the movie *{tag: Hustle and Flow}*, beating out songs from *{tag: Crash}* and *{tag: Transamerica}*. Three Six Mafia easily gave the most enthusiastic Oscar speech and reigned in the song's not-for-primetime lyrics for their live performance. While the song nicely follows last year's winner, "Lose Yourself" from *8 Mile*, it's a far cry from the first original song winner: "The Continental" from *The Gay Divorcee*. (No Brokeback Mountain jokes, please.)

Next up is a discussion of a musical phenomenon even Jim and Greg can't explain: the recent success of {artist: Matisyahu}. The {tag: Hasidic} reggae performer is climbing the {tag: Billboard} charts and selling out shows across the country, and he certainly doesn't follow any pop formula of which our hosts are aware. Born {name: Matthew Miller} in {place: White Plains, NY}, the singer started out as an average jam band follower before joining a Hasidic community in Brooklyn. His music, which infuses {tag: Jewish} imagery and prayers with {genre: reggae} beats and {genre: hip-hop} rhymes, has attracted a cross-section of people. To get a better perspective on why Matisyahu is achieving such success, Jim and Greg speak to two fans—a Jewish community leader who appreciates the singer's faith and a non-Jewish reggae fan who was turned on to the music by his teenage son.

## 00:21:46 Interview: Jeff Chang
{name: Jeff Chang}, author of {tag: *Can't Stop, Won't Stop: A History of the Hip Hop Generation*}, joins {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} in the studio this week. Jeff, who co-founded the {label: Quannum Label} in {place: San Francisco}, was on the show previously when his book first came out, and he and our hosts engaged in a discussion of {genre: hip-hop}'s history. Now that Jeff's book has come out on paperback, Jim and Greg welcome him back to the show to discuss where hip-hop is today and where it is going. In order to get a sense of hip-hop's diverse makeup, the three music journalists decide to embark on a geographical tour of the genre, beginning with Chicago and working their way through the United States, and even the U.K. 

### Chicago	
Our hometown sound developed out of the {place: East Coast} style, but infused the distinctive elements of {place: Chicago} {genre: house} music and {genre: soul}. Established artists include {artist: Kanye West}, {artist: Common} and {artist: Twista}, however listeners should look out for emerging rappers and producers {artist: Diverse}, {artist: The Molemen}, {artist: Rhymefest}, {artist: All Natural} and {artist: Lupe Fiasco} who is featured on Kanye's latest single "{track: Touch the Sky}", and who is set to release an album this summer produced by {artist: Jay-Z} and {name: Mike Shinoda} of {artist: Linkin Park}.


### The South	
Southern {genre: rap} has dominated the charts for many years now. This can be attributed to the sound, as well as the single-oriented, club-friendly nature of the scene. 
Atlanta, with artists like {artist: Outkast}, {artist: Ludacris}, {artist: Cee-Lo} and {artist: Jermaine Dupri}, was the hub of this scene for some time. Rappers and producers {artist: Lil Jon}, and the {artist: Ying Yang Twins}also propelled {genre: crunk} music which is distinctive for its rhythmic, repetitive lyrics and prominent looped drum sounds. Now it has rappers like {artist: Lil Bow Wow}, {artist: T.I.} and {artist: Young Jeezy} emerging. 

{place: Houston} has recently challenged Atlanta's status as a hub. {artist: Paul Wall}, {artist: D4L}, {artist: Slim Thug} and {artist: Mike Jones} have all enjoyed tremendous success. While crunk/Atlanta rappers have made their sound synonymous with energy, the Houston sound is the exact opposite aesthetic. Dubbed "Chopped and Screwed," its signature sound (based on a mixing effect perfected by the late {artist: DJ Screw}) essentially slowed the tempo of the record while repeating certain phrases.

There are other, smaller Southern scenes as well. {artist: Missy Elliott}, {artist: Pharrell} and the {artist: Neptunes}, {artist: Timbaland}, and most recently, {artist: Clipse}, all come out of {place: Virginia}. {artist: Arrested Development} and recent {tag: Oscar} winners {artist: Three Six Mafia} come from {place: Tennessee}. {artist: Trick Daddy}, {artist: 2 Live Crew} and {artist: Pitbull} emerged from {place: Florida}. And North and {place: South Carolina} are home to {artist: Petey Pablo} and {artist: Little Brother}.

### East Coast 
Most people are familiar with the big players like {artist: Nas}, {artist: Jay-Z} and the late {artist: Notorious B.IG.}, as well as pioneers like {artist: A Tribe Called Quest}, {artist: WuTang Clan} and {artist: Public Enemy}, but the {place: New York}/{place: Philadelphia} scene is far from insignificant. {artist: 50 Cent}, {artist: Talib Kweli}, {artist: Mos Def}, {artist: Cam'ron}, {artist: The Roots}, and newcomer {artist: Papoose} continue to keep it alive. Plus, with Nas signed to Jay-Z's {label: Def Jam} label, and Jay-Z reportedly working on an album with {artist: Dr. Dre}, expect new things to come.


### West Coast
The {place: West Coast}, whose sound was established by names like {artist: Dr. Dre}, {artist: Snoop Dogg}, {artist: NWA} and {artist: Tupac Shakur}, also continues to thrive. Dr. Dre continues to produce records for fellow Californian {artist: The Game}, as well as {artist: Eminem} and {artist: 50 Cent}. Also, the {artist: Black Eyed Peas} pop makeover brought them big success in the past couple of years. {place: San Francisco} is also home to {artist: DJ Shadow}, {artist: Blackalicious} and {artist: Lyrics Born}, and our guest mentions the {artist: E-40} and the rising {genre: Hyphy} sound, which is like a faster, less dense version of crunk.


### London
Surprisingly, one of the major bases of hip hop's future may not even be on US soil. {genre: Grime} music, which comes out of London, has roots in both {genre: electronic} music and hip hop. It varies, but much of the grime sound can be fairly dark and aggressive with rapid rhyming. British artists to check out include {artist: Dizzee Rascal}, {artist: The Streets}, {artist: Ms. Dynamite}, {artist: M.I.A.}, and {artist: Lady Sovereign}, who was recently signed to {label: Def Jam} Records.


## 00:47:31 Review: David Gilmour
![On An Island](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0c/David_Gilmour_On_An_Island.jpg "638538/159841423")

This week {artist: Pink Floyd} guitarist {artist: David Gilmour} released his first album in over ten years. While fans of the band won't get any {name: Roger Waters} or {name: Nick Mason}, {album: On an Island} has a few Floydian moments and impressive credits: {artist: David Crosby} and {artist: Graham Nash} on vocals, {artist: Richard Wright} on organ, and {artist: Roxy Music} guitarist {name: Phil Manzanera} as producer. The songs were also co-written by Gilmour's wife, {name: Polly Samson}. These facts did nothing to improve {host: Jim} or {host: Greg}'s opinion of this release. The sleep-inducing, uninspired, uncreative album gets not one, but four {tag: Trash It}s—one for every original member of Pink Floyd.

## 00:54:38 Review: Goldfrapp
![Supernature](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/b6/0f/5d/b60f5d5d-dbc3-f1cf-bb15-ab49c72382e4/source/600x600bb.jpg "20135455/1193716159")
Next up for review is {album: Supernature} by {artist: Goldfrapp}. This is the third album from the British {genre: electro-pop} duo whose inspirations range from {artist: Marlene Dietrich} to {artist: T-Rex} to {artist: Massive Attack}. {host: Greg} was a huge fan of their 2002 release {album: Felt Mountain}. He is less enamored of this effort, however, and gives it a {tag: Trash It} rating. {host: Jim} is slightly more kind, and recommends listeners {tag: Burn It}.
