# Show 64: Rocket to Russia (Classic Album Dissection) & Lucinda Williams Review
It's time for Jim and Greg to conduct another classic album dissection.

Then, stay tuned for a review of the latest alt-country release from Lucinda Williams.

## 00:01:45 News: 02.16.07
The first item in the news is a discussion of last week's {tag: Grammy} Awards. For Jim and Greg, the Grammy Awards are always about as newsworthy as the {tag: Rock and Roll Hall of Fame }ceremonies. It is their job to cover such things, though, despite the fact that the Awards don't really represent the best music of the year. {artist: The Dixie Chicks} swept the ceremonies, but Jim and Greg suspect that might have more to do with affirming the Chicks' politics than it does their music. The other hype surrounding last Sunday's broadcast was the much-anticipated Police reunion. The band mates looked as distant as ever, and Greg wonders if they have the stamina to handle a large-scale tour. 

Jim and Greg think there might be better gauges of the best music of 2006. The first is the {tag: Village Voice Pazz and Jop Poll} which takes into consideration the opinions of hundreds of music critics, including our own Mr. Kot. This is the first year that {name: Robert Christgau} has not curated the poll, though he was still a voter. The album that reigned supreme with these critics was {artist: Bob Dylan}'s {album: Modern Times}. That record did not even make [our hosts' top 10 lists](show/54/). Pazz and Jop's number one single of 2006 was "{track: Crazy}" by {artist: Gnarls Barkley}.

Other awards and polls that are worth checking out are the Idolator.com critics poll, aptly named "Jackin' Pop," and the heartonastick.blog-city.com, which posts the cumulative picks of a number of music bloggers. These polls are more timely than the Grammys and are much more inclusive. Jackin' Pop and Heart On a Stick agreed with Greg and put {artist: TV on the Radio} in the number one slot.

## 00:21:45 Classic Album Dissection: Rocket to Russia
![Rocket to Russia](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/64/1090.jpg)

Jim and Greg have mastered the art of the album dissection. This week they try their hand at {album: Rocket to Russia} by {artist: The Ramones}. This was the {genre: punk} originators' third album, released in April of {era: 1977}. Jim and Greg picked this album because of how revolutionary it was at the time. This was the era of {artist: Yes}, {artist: James Taylor} and {artist: KC and the Sunshine Band}. Now that radio playlists are full of songs by bands like {artist: Fall Out Boy} and {artist: Green Day}, it's easy to forget a time before punk music. But, until four high schoolers from {place: Forest Hills, NY} merged their love of Brill-Building pop and {genre: British invasion rock} with a big dose of speed and attitude, the sound as we know it didn't exist.

{name: Joey Ramone}, born {name: Jeffrey Hyman}, sang vocals, {name: Johnny Ramone}, born {name: John Cummings}, played guitar, {name: Dee Dee Ramone}, born {name: Douglas Colvin}, played bass and {name: Tommy Ramone}, born {name: Tom Erdelyi}, played drums. The four began to record {album: Rocket to Russia} after recently releasing two other albums and touring the US and Europe. Today, Tommy Ramone is the only living member of that original group. Tommy co-produced {album: Rocket to Russia} and wrote many of the songs, and Jim and Greg invited him on to talk about making the album.

It was a treat to get a first-hand account of recording {album: Rocket to Russia} from Tommy Ramone. He revealed a number of interesting facts, some of which surprised even our hosts. Here are some of the noteworthy points:

- Johnny is known for being a speed demon. Tommy credits this with his desire to be a baseball player and his love of the fastball.
- Joey is the band's original drummer, and Tommy acted as their manager. Tommy took over on drums in order to keep up with Johnny's pace. He had never played drums before, and sometimes outpaced the studio's click track.
- {name: Seymour Stein} was the label executive behind the band. Despite the fact that their sound wasn't popular, he believed in The Ramones enough to boost their recording budget up to a whopping $25,000.
- The Ramones heard {album: God Save the Queen} by {artist: the Sex Pistols} during the recording of this album. Despite not having nearly the same amount of money to work with, Tommy explains that there was definitely a sense of competition. The feeling wa -- they ripped us off, and now we want to sound better.
- The Ramones were famous for being anti-guitar solo. But, there is one on the track "{track: Here Today, Gone Tomorrow}." Tommy reveals that this was actually him playing guitar, and assures Jim and Greg that Johnny wasn't miffed by the choice. Tommy was inspired by the guitar solo in "{track: Tell Me}" by {artist: the Rolling Stones}.
- A number of the songs on {album: Rocket to Russia} begin with Dee Dee counting off. The band encouraged their bassist to do this, despite the fact that those counts had nothing to do with the actual speed of the song.
- Tommy struggles to name his favorite tune on the album, but includes "{track: Rockaway Beach}" as one of the best. Jim and Greg agree that the sunny, pop track is a great one, made even better by the fact that the actual Rockaway Beach was not a very sunny place. Juxtapose the sound of the song with the idea of trash in the sand and a syringe in your foot.

Jim and Greg also struggle to pick just one song to highlight from {album: Rocket to Russia}. Each one is great, and only clocks out at around two minutes. But, Greg was inspired by something Tommy said during their interview. He explained that the Ramones were ahead of their time, and were perhaps too dark and too subversive for mainstream culture. The song that best exemplifies this is "{track: We're a Happy Family}." While {tag: Happy Days} showed one kind of family life, The Ramones wanted to show another, more realistic one. The Ramones were fans of {name: Todd Browning}'s film {tag: Freaks}, and celebrated the idea of being different and freaky in this song.

Jim's song choice also celebrates that freak spirit. "{track: Sheena Is a Punk Rocker}," only has a few words, but it's a definitely an anthem. The term punk previously had a negative connotation. In this song, the Ramones reclaim the word and give a big finger to anyone who judges them (or Sheena). Musically, the song is also quintessentially {genre: rock and roll}, quintessentially American, quintessentially Ramones. Jim explains that if he had to choose one track to shoot into outer space and represent what rock music is, he'd choose "Sheena Is a Punk Rocker."

## 00:50:15 Review: Lucinda Williams
![West (Bonus Track Version)](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/64/2BR0.jpg)
It may not be fair, but {artist: Lucinda Williams} gets to follow the Ramones. Her new album, {album: West}, was released last week. This is Williams' eighth album in a 28-year career that has established her as one of music's premiere {genre: singer/songwriter}s. Williams grew up steeped in literature and poetry as well as {genre: rock}, {genre: country} and {genre: folk} music, and that background has really affected her sound. This album is in the same vein, but takes a somewhat different turn with {tag: producer} {name: Hal Wilner}. Jim loves what Wilner contributes to the album. It feels like you are right there with Lucinda, who is "venting her spleen." But, {host: Jim} has to wonder if everything is OK in the Williams household. The album is just too dark, and too oppressive. He gives it a {tag: Burn It}. {host: Greg} agrees that people should hide their razor blades while listening to this album, but notes that Wilner is really effective at setting a mood and putting William's voice in the forefront. He just wishes that she varied the musical palette more on {album: West}. He'd like to hear more songs like the fiery "{track: Come On}." It's another Burn It for Greg.
