# Show 536: Reviews Round-Up

![Reviews Round-Up](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2016/reviewroundup_web.jpg)

As we move slowly toward spring, the music release schedule starts heating up as well. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} review a bevy of new albums, including records by {artist: TEEN}, {artist: Mavis Staples}, {artist: Bonnie Raitt}, and more. 


## 00:02:14 News: 03.04.16
{place: The Magic Shop}, a {tag: recording studio} in {place: SoHo} in {place: New York}, will be closing its doors soon after 28 years. The studio was a favorite of {artist: David Bowie}, {artist: Lou Reed}, {artist: Arcade Fire}, {artist: Sonic Youth}, and more. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} have noticed a number of high profile recording studios that have closed in the past decade. To examine what's driving this trend, they speak with {name: Larry Crane}, owner of {place: Jackpot! Recording Studio} in {place: Portland} and founder/editor of {tag: Tape Op} Magazine. Crane argues that the commonly told story that digital recording is killing the industry is a misdirection – home recording has really been around for more than half a century, after all. Issues like gentrification and real estate are playing just as big of a role. While changes are indeed happening acrossthe industry, Crane is optimistic that there's still a place for recording studios of all sizes in the future.


## 00:11:45 Review: Mavis Staples
![Livin' on a High Note](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/536/JL0.jpg)
{artist: Mavis Staples} had a legendary career with her family's {genre: gospel} and {genre: soul} band {artist: The Staple Singers}, which was a major part of the {tag: protest movement} of the {era: 1960s} and scored huge hits for {label: Stax} in the {era: 1970s}. Mavis reinvented herself as solo artist in 2000s, collaborating on records with {name: Ry Cooder} and {name: Jeff Tweedy}. For {album: Livin' On a High Note}, she and producer {name: M. Ward} as a producer asked a variety of contemporary songwriters to write material for her to sing, including {name: Neko Case}, {name: Nick Cave}, {artist: Bon Iver}'s {name: Justin Vernon}, and {name: Merrill Garbus} of {artist: tUnE-yArDs}. {host: Jim} loves how the best songs bring Mavis full circle by referencing on the {tag: Black Lives Matter} movement. While the other songs are hit and miss, Mavis Staples is a "national treasure" and her voice is as powerful as ever. Jim is still waiting for her end career masterpiece, but this album is a definite {tag: Buy It}. {host: Greg} – who literally [wrote the book on Mavis Staples](http://books.simonandschuster.com/Ill-Take-You-There/Greg-Kot/9781451647860) – points to {album: We'll Never Turn Back} as her masterpiece, but says this album is very good too. He loves what she does even with the lesser songs, like Vernon's generic love song, which she transforms into a moving address to her sister {name: Yvonne Staples}. In the middle of her 70s, Mavis Staples is doing some of the best work of her career.

## 00:21:25 Review: Santigold
![99 Cents](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/536/ZP0.jpg)
{artist: Santigold} was known as Santogold when she released her debut album in {era: 2008}, a combo of {genre: reggae} and {genre: new wave} that established her as an artist. On her third and most recent album, {album: 99¢}, she worked with {artist: TV on the Radio}, {artist: Yeah Yeah Yeahs}, {artist: Vampire Weekend}, {name: Cathy Dennis}, and {name: Patrik Berger}. Santigold named the album 99¢ because that's how much she thinks it's worth, and {host: Jim} concedes he would pay at least double that for it. But it's not a stellar album from start to finish. The middle of the album is weighed down by a few sluggish tracks, especially the duet with {artist: ILoveMakonnen}, but combine that with the handful of fun dance {genre: pop punk} songs, and it's a {tag: Try It} album for Jim. {host: Greg} has always loved Santigold's ability to put smart lyrics inside catchy packages. And on this album, there are a few tracks that do just that. {track: Banshee} is one of Greg's favorites. It juxtaposes the darkness of drug addiction against an up-tempo, celebratory sound. Not every track is as successful though, and Greg is ultimately a little let down. *99¢* is a {tag: Try It} for Greg as well. 

## 00:27:58 Review: TEEN
![Love Yes](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/536/1AM0.jpg)
{genre: Alt-rock} group {artist: TEEN} is made up of sisters Katherine, Lizzie and {name: Kristina (Teeny) Lieberson} and {name: Boshra AlSaadi}. But in 2010, TEEN was a mere home recording project by Teeny. TEEN's third full-length album, {album: Love Yes}, introduces them to their widest audience yet. {host: Greg} has loved TEEN since the beginning because of what they set out to do, but their execution always fell short. In *Love Yes,* the band has improved at crafting their quirks into tight pop songs. Still, Greg takes issue with the lack of editing here. The album is full of great ideas, but having four tracks end with too-long horn solos is not one of them. Despite that, this is the band's best album yet. *Love Yes* is a {tag: Try It} for Greg. {host: Jim} thinks Greg is being stingy and gives kudos to TEEN's ambition. They combine {genre: shoegaze}, {genre: funk} and {genre: soul} in a way that really works. Plus *Love Yes* lays out a new perspective on love, steering clear of sappiness typical of love songs, while still ringing hopeful. Jim goes so far as to call this record a masterpiece and undoubtedly a {tag: Buy It}. 

## 00:34:23 Review: Bonnie Raitt
![Dig in Deep](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/536/1LB0.jpg)
Forget about these young whippersnappers featured on today's show. {artist: Bonnie Raitt} has just released her 20th album! Called {album: Dig In Deep}, it has the {genre: blues} {genre: rock} veteran working overtime as artist, producer and label head. But, as {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} remark, there's nothing tired or stale here, Greg exclaims, "let us all bow down to her slide {tag: guitar} tone" and gives {album: Dig in Deep} a {tag: Buy It}. Jim goes with a {tag: Try It}, explaining that while he appreciates the up-tempo tracks, he isn't moved by the ballads. 


## 00:43:28 Review: Julia Holter
![Have You in My Wilderness](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/536/20G0.jpg)
{genre: Avant-garde} {tag: singer-songwriter} {artist: Julia Holter} returns with her fourth studio album, {album: Have You in My Wilderness}. Holter is a {tag: multi-instrumentalist} and composer who is influenced by both {genre: folk} and {genre: electronic experimental} music. Her earlier efforts were more abstract and disjointed, however her latest album takes on a more simple, {genre: pop} demeanor. {host: Greg} really enjoyed this record and found its songs to be intelligently catchy. He really looks forward to hearing where she goes next in her musical career and gives this album a "{tag: Buy It}." {host: Jim} agrees, and finds *Have You in My Wilderness* to be a pure joy. He appreciates her specific and unique interests in classical, folk and electronic music. Jim also compares her artistry to that of {artist: Bjork} and gives Holter's album a "{tag: Buy It}."



## 00:49:56 DIJ: Greg

This week, {host: Greg} has the legendary {artist: Jackie Wilson} on his mind. Early in his career, Wilson drew comparisons to {artist: Elvis} but in fact, you couldn't liken him to anyone. Wilson heavily influenced many artists, namely {artist: Michael Jackson} and even {artist: James Brown} with his style, dance moves and vocals. In the {era: '50s}, he had an amazing run with big hits but floundered in the {era: '60s}. When he came to {place: Chicago} to work with record producer {tag: Carl Davis}, they cut one of Greg's favorite tracks ever, "{track: (Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher}." Greg thinks this is pretty much as perfect as a song can get, and that's why he selected it as his {tag: Desert Island Jukebox pick} this week.
