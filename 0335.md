## 00:01:45 Intro: Music News

More sad news at the top of the show this week. {tag : Singer} and {tag : drummer}Â  {name : Levon Helm} recently died at age 71, and as Jim and Greg explain, he was a fascinating character in rock, one that might epitomize American music. His self-effacing personality combined with his never-flashy drum style gave {artist : The Band} exactly what it needed. They also note how extraordinary it was for a drummer to be such an accomplished vocalist. You can hear it on tracks like "{track : The Weight}" and "{track : Up on Cripple Creek}," and especially {artist : The Band}'s {artist : Marvin Gaye} cover "{track : Don't Do It}." Fans should also check out Helm's star turn in The Right Stuff and Coal Miner's Daughter.



## 00:08:08 Rock Doctors: Family Practice

Time now for {tag : The Rock Doctors} to open up the clinic. Every so often Jim and Greg like to give back, so to speak, and help some listeners with an ailment of a musical variety. Whether someone is allergic to {genre : hip hop} or addicted to {genre : jam band}s, our hosts hope they can provide the right musical prescription. Heck, they've even taken an appointment with Nobel Prize winning economist {name : Paul Krugman}.

Before they get to their main appointment of the episode, they run over to the emergency room to take a call from Anne in {place : Philadelphia}. Anne is getting married next month and has been racking her brain to come up with a good song for the "Father/Daughter" dance. Problem is, Dad is something of a music expert who likes to dig deep for his wedding selections. But songs like {artist : Leadbelly}'s "{track : Ain't It A Shame}" don't hit the right emotional chord (and aren't exactly crowd pleasers).

So, Anne wants to know what Drs. Kot and DeRogatis would recommend? Greg goes first, suggesting "{track : The Way You Look Tonight}." Sure, this Oscar-winner could be an obvious choice, but it's the lesser-known version by {artist : The Jaguars} that Greg prescribes. Jim takes a cue from one of rock's best Dads, {artist : Loudon Wainwright III} (father to Martha and Rufus and Marshall). His song "{track : Daughter}" has the perfect mix of humor and sentimentality.

Jim and Greg call their next two patients in from the waiting room. Doug and Susan have been happily married for 18 years. But they've never been able to get along...musically. Doug is a Presbyterian minister with an {genre : indie rock} past who remains as passionate as ever about music. He loves jangly pop and expansive Spector-esque production, but doesn't give a lick about lyrics. Susan, he tells our nurse, is stuck in "{genre : Classic Rock} Hell and {era : '70s} Rock Purgatory." She still favors FM rock like {artist : Jimmy Buffett} and {artist : Little Feat}, and has little tolerance for Doug's "trash can music" and fondness for "whiny broads." So the doctors are tasked with finding this couple something new they can listen to together.

Jim begins by recommending a dose of the {place : California} quartet {artist : Delta Spirit}. He couldn't resist prescribing Susan a band that actually uses trash cans, but more he thinks the couple will appreciate the group's emotional and spiritual lyrics. Greg prescribes {album : Arrow} by {artist : Heartless Bastards}. On their 4th release the Ohio group finally has the songs to match the intensity of Erika Wennerstrom's vocals. And they reference much of the classic rock and soul that Susan favors.

So how did the medicine go down? Doug gives a Buy It to {artist : Delta Spirit}, noting that {name : Matthew Vasquez} can really sing. Susan still just hears this as something up Doug's alley. Doug also appreciated {artist : Heartless Bastards}, but despite {name : Wennerstrom}'s singing style, not because of it. He's curious to see the band live, but didn't fall in love with the record. Susan liked the direction Greg went in more, but again, didn't find a winner in {artist : Heartless Bastards}. But both husband and wife enjoyed the process of listening to and critiquing music...and that's all the Doctors can really ask for!

## 00:47:01 Review: Jack White

![Blunderbuss](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/335/26D0.jpg)

A blunderbuss is an antique gun that shoots scattershot-the perfect name for an album by {artist : Jack White}. It's a nod to the old, something {artist : The White Stripes} front man favors, but also references how wide in scope the album is. On his solo debut, the {tag : singer}, {tag : guitarist}, {tag : producer} and label head incorporated lots of piano and stringed music. {host : Greg} is as impressed by this variety as he is by the story the songs tell. {host : Jim} doesn't hear as many departures. But he does get another set of extraordinary anthems. So both hosts give {album : Blunderbuss} a double {tag : Buy It} rating...but for different reasons.
