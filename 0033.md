# Show 33: Rhymefest & Thom Yorke Review
This week on the show Jim and Greg welcome a hip hop star on the rise--{artist: Rhymefest}. Plus, they'll review the new record from {artist: Radiohead} frontman {artist: Thom Yorke} and take a look at the life and times of {name: Syd Barrett}.

## 00:02:29 News: 07-15-06
The 2006 {tag: Nielsen Soundscan} midyear report came out this week, and some of its findings are surprising. While the buzz seems to be that the music industry is being killed by digital music sales, which increased by 77% from 2005, albums are only down by 4.2%. So {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} aren't consoling record executives just yet. The more significant revelation? The disconnect between what critics enjoy and what people buy may be even greater than previously thought. The number-one selling album of the year so far is not by a venerated rock artist or a hip-hop star -- rather, it's the soundtrack to {tag: High School Musical}, a {tag: Disney} made-for-TV movie. The tween phenomenon shows how young girls still have much of the buying power in the industry. Coming in second is {genre: country}/{genre: pop} act {artist: Rascal Flatts}. And a further scan of the list reveals that {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} were only compelled to review two of the records on it: {artist: Mary J. Blige}'s {album: The Breakthrough} and {album: Taking the Long Way} by the {artist: Dixie Chicks}. Hopefully that trends turn around in the months to come. Otherwise Jim and Greg will have to score that [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfh-lJuRbzw) with {name: Zac [Efron]} after all... 

{artist: Pink Floyd} founder {name: Syd Barrett} died this week at his home in {place: Cambridge}, England. Barrett started the band, which he named after two American bluesmen, {name: Pink Anderson} and {name: Floyd Council}, in 1965. After releasing {album: The Piper at the Gates of Dawn} (which was recorded at {tag: Abbey Road} the same year as the other British {genre: psychedelic} hallmark, {album: Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band}), Barrett became a superstar. However, as Jim and Greg explain, this natural frontman shunned the spotlight. Barrett became a heavy {tag: LSD} user and was likely suffering from schizophrenia. By 1968 he was forced to leave the band. He subsequently made two solo albums, but eventually went into virtual exile. Yet his influence on the band, and on future musicians, remained strong, as bandmate {name: Nick Mason} tells Jim. Mason, like all Pink Floyd fans, understood what a talent Barrett was and wished he had intervened to prevent such a tragic end. Still, Barrett's legacy lives on through his music. Listen to "{track: Baby Lemonade}," one of Barrett's last performances with members of Pink Floyd, as well as {artist: David Bowie}'s cover of "{track: See Emily Play}."

## 00:21:15 Interview: Rhymefest
Rapper {artist: Rhymefest} joins Jim and Greg on the show this week. Rhymefest, born {name: Che Smith} in {place: Chicago}'s Jeffrey Manor neighborhood, is one of many Chicago rappers slated to be the next {artist: Kanye [West]} or {artist: Common}. But Rhymefest is no novice to the scene. A longtime staple of the city's battle rapping scene, Rhymefest initially claimed fame after defeating {artist: Eminem} in an emcee tournament. He later helped to pen Kanye West's {tag: Grammy}-winning song "{track: Jesus Walks}." But now listeners can hear some of Rhymefest's own work, from his major label debut {album: Blue Collar}, released this week.

Two of the tracks you'll hear are "{track: Devil's Pie}," which is based on a sample of {artist: The Strokes}' "{track: Someday}," and "{track: Bullet}," which samples {artist: Citizen Cope}'s "{track: Bullet and a Target}." Rhymefest plays "Bullet" and explains the story behind this track to Jim and Greg. He recounts being at the mall, and seeing a promotion to win a brand new Hummer. But upon further investigation, the rapper discovers that this is not a sweepstakes he is signing up for, but rather the U.S. Army.

## 00:43:41 Review: Thom Yorke
![The Eraser](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/9f/77/31/9f773167-84fc-b46d-1aeb-89015e8a1cce/source/600x600bb.jpg "39753073/161162568")
{artist: Radiohead} frontman {artist: Thom Yorke} recently put out a new album, {album: The Eraser}. It's his first solo album, though as he [explained to Jim and Greg](/show/30/) a few weeks ago, it's perhaps unfair to label it as such. Many of the tracks were composed by members of the band, and it was produced by longtime Radiohead collaborator {name: Nigel Godrich}. But the record is credited to Yorke, so Jim and Greg decide to stick with the term "solo." Jim has long resisted jumping on the Radiohead train, though he's always enjoyed their rhythm section as well as their live performances -- so it's interesting that this album, which lacks the bombast of their live shows, is the one to finally teach {host: Jim} to "stop worrying and love the Yorke." He gives it a {tag: Buy It} rating. {host: Greg}, a longtime Radiohead fan, is actually the dissenter here. He likes the record, but finds it to be merely a modest production, earning a modest {tag: Burn It}.

## 00:48:42 Review: India.Arie
![Testimony: Vol. 1 Life & Relationship](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/cf/9f/eb/cf9feb50-6684-19be-0831-a55d7fe95fef/source/600x600bb.jpg "92325/166709488")
The number-one album this week is {artist: India.Arie}'s third release {album: Testimony: Vol.1, Life & Relationship}. It's the first number-one record for the {genre: neo-soul} singer, who previously achieved success with {album: Acoustic Soul} and its hit single, "{track: Video}." But while they admired the earlier album's stripped-down and sensual approach, neither {host: Jim} nor {host: Greg} find the new effort to be successful. Even though it means well, Jim says that he "despises" *Testimony* and its pseudo-self-help [lyrics](http://www.metrolyrics.com/i-choose-lyrics-india-arie.html). Greg agrees, citing cliché after cliché as reasons he won't be going back for another listen. This number-one record gets two {tag: Trash It}s.

## 00:54:22 DIJ: Jim
Just as {artist: Rhymefest} was inspired by {artist: The Strokes}' song "{track: Someday}," which he sampled in his track "{track: Devil's Pie}," Jim, too, was inspired to choose it as his {tag: Desert Island Jukebox} song. While the Strokes don't have a typical {genre: hip-hop} sound, Jim explains that their rhythms, which echo a {place: New York} subway train, have a very hip-hop beat and momentum. The man largely responsible for that sound is drummer {name: Fabrizio Moretti}, who Jim admires for being a masterful, simplistic drummer, if not for a few other [reasons](http://www.popsugar.com/Drew-Fabrizio-Get-Kissy-Kissy-3818?sidcheck=1&idcheck=1).
