# Show 481: Run the Jewels and Opinions on Father John Misty

![Run the Jewels](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2015/rtj_web2.jpg)

{name: Killer Mike} and {name: El-P} of {artist: Run the Jewels} talk about their unique brand of {genre: hip-hop} and perform songs from one of the most highly acclaimed rap albums of 2014. Later {artist: Father John Misty} takes a new stab at the classic love song.


## 00:02:19 News: 2.12.15
After recovering from the intense musical [spectacle](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/katy-perry-on-super-bowl-god-said-you-got-this-20150208) at this year's {tag: Superbowl}, viewers were ready for the {tag: Grammy Awards}. But, it seems 11% less viewers were ready. Those that tuned in witnessed {artist: Beck}'s surprise win for *Album of the Year* and the coronation of {artist: Sam Smith} as pop music's new prince. But, they also had to sit through an out-of-left field tribute to {artist: ELO} and bizarre performance pairings including {artist: Jessie J} and {artist: Tom Jones }and {artist: Ed Sheeran} and {artist: Herbie Hancock}.  

As always, Jim and Greg note that the collection of {tag: Grammy}-winning tunes and albums does not provide an accurate picture of what was really the best of 2014. A better barometer has always been the {tag: *Village Voice*} {tag: Pazz & Jop} Poll of critics. This year's list includes {artist: D'Angelo}, {artist: St. Vincent} and even {artist: Taylor Swift}. An even better barometer? Sound Opinions' [Best Albums of 2014](http://soundopinions.org/show/471), of course!

## 00:07:19 Interview: Run the Jewels
Rapper {name: Killer Mike} and rapper/producer {name: El-P} are have both enjoyed a long history of critical acclaim. But it wasn't until formed a duo - {artist: Run the Jewels} - that they enjoyed widespread attention and acclaim. The idea to work with El-P was suggested to Killer Mike by {name: Jason DeMarco} of {tag: Cartoon Network}. Their bromance formed instantly, and the result was 2013's {album: Run the Jewels} and then 2014's {album: Run the Jewels 2}. Both were free releases, but {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} still said "Buy It" and added was the album to their Best of 2014 lists. This sophomore effort maintains the original's humor, but also adds more depth and more social and political commentary.  Check out their special set from the new {label: Goose Island Barrel House} here in {place: Chicago}.


## 00:48:41 Review: Father John Misty
![I Love You, Honeybear](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/481/2950.jpg)
Like {name: Phil Collins} and {name: Dave Grohl} before him, {name: Josh Tillman} started a {tag: drummer} for the {genre: indie} band {artist: Fleet Foxes}. In 2011 he went on a mystical, {place: west-coast} odyssey (drugs were involved) and returned with a new solo artist persona named {artist: Father John Misty}. In his latest album {album: I Love You, Honeybear}, Misty chronicles falling in love with his wife with some unconventional love songs. {host: Greg} argues that it's not easy to write love songs that don't sound sticky, and commends Misty on the humor in his lyrics. But, he wishes the record was more musically flamboyant and gives it a {tag: Try It}. To say {host: Jim} disliked this album is putting it mildly. He compares the listening experience to having an allergic reaction to bee stings. He doesn't hear the humor in Misty's lyrics, but rather something more misogynistic. So he says {tag: Trash It}.
