![Hero Worship](https://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2016/heroworship_web.jpg)

Artists are also music fans like the rest of us, often paying tribute to the musicians who inspired them. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} share their favorite examples of {tag: Hero Worship} in music â€“ songs that name-check great artists from the history of rock and roll. 

## 00:01:46 List: Hero Worship
Without a doubt, musicians influence one another.  Sometimes in subtle ways with a borrowed riff or lyric. Sometimes by overtly name-checking another artist. This week, we look at those obvious examples of {tag: Hero Worship} - songs written about another musican. Think of {artist: Bob Dylan}'s {track: Song to Woody}, or {artist: David Bowie}'s {track: Song For Bob Dylan}. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} picked some tracks from their musical heroes, that mention other musical heroes. 

### Jim
- {artist: The Replacements}, "{track: Alex Chilton}" 
- {artist: Television Personalities}, "{track: I Know Where Syd Barrett Lives}"
- {artist: Cheap Trick}, "{track: Surrender}"
- {artist: Robyn Hitchcock}, "{track: I Saw Nick Drake}"

### Greg

## 00:43:09 Review: The Rolling Stones
![Blue & Lonesome](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/1c/cd/73/1ccd73b4-e2ae-4eb9-72a4-16eed6eba7e0/source/600x600bb.jpg "1249595/1160520264")
{artist: The Rolling Stones} have been a band for more than half a cenutry, releasing 25 albums and still sell out stadiums around the world. While the group's popularity has seemingly never waned, some have argued their musical creaitivty fizzled out long ago. {host: Jim} had thought that the last good Stones album was 1978's {album: Some Girls}, however he absolutely loves their latest record {album: Blue & Lonesome}. Jim can hear the passion and heart in this album full of covers of songs by some of their Chicago blues heroes, including {artist: Little Walter}, {artist: Howlin' Wolf} and {artist: Memphis Slim}. He gives it an enthusiastic {tag: Buy It}. {host: Greg} also went into this review with a bit of skepticism, but ended up loving it as well. He points out that {artist: Mick Jagger} in particular found his love of music again on this record, and is really a gifted blues musician and harmonica player. Greg gives Blue & Lonesome a definitive {tag: Buy It}.


## 00:50:02 DIJ: Jim
This week, {host: Jim} pays tribute to {name: Sharon Jones}, a huge figure in the {genre: neo-soul} revival, who [died November 18](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/arts/music/sharon-jones-dap-kings-dead.html) after a battle with cancer. With her powerful voice and electric stage presence, Jones was, according to Jim, the true inheritor of the legacy of fellow {place: Augusta}, {place: Georgia} native {artist: James Brown}. She moved to {place: Brooklyn} where she ended up teaming up with {artist: The Dap-Kings}, the finest {genre: soul} / {genre: R&B} backing band since {label: Stax}. Their 2013 song "{track: Stranger to My Happiness}" exemplifies her bravery against her illness. Ostensibly a love song, the lyrics also find Jones reckoning with mortality. She didn't wear a wig after losing her hair from chemotherapy, refusing to pretend to be anything she wasn't. You can see that in a [powerful video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlPE1rEdAdI) {artist: Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings} recorded for "Stranger to My Happiness," which is Jim's Desert Island Jukebox pick of the week.
