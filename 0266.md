## 00:01:51 Review: Michael Jackson
![Michael](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music60/v4/f3/0c/e8/f30ce8c3-c5f7-2122-ea4a-0f6dcd939618/source/600x600bb.jpg "32940/408082743")
Following the death of {artist: Michael Jackson}, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} predicted there would be an onslaught of posthumous releases. Now the first has been released. {album: Michael} is made up of 10 tracks from Jackson's archives, gussied up by {tag: producer}s like {name:  Teddy Riley}, {name: John McClain} and {name: Lenny Kravitz}. There's been some controversy as to whether or not this is Jackson's voice, and Riley admits there was quite a bit of processing â€“ too much, if you ask Jim and Greg. While Greg admires the sparsest, most emotional track, "{track: Much Too Soon}," the rest of the album is really hurting. And the awful production completely destroys what Jackson might have been intending with those tracks. Jim was not a fan of Jackson's material from the past fifteen years, but he respects Jackson's perfectionist nature. Surely such a perfectionist wouldn't have released these overblown clunkers. Michael gets a double {tag: Trash It}.

## 00:09:40 Interview: Quincy Jones

One of the figures in the music industry most closely associated with {artist: Michael Jackson} is producer {artist: Quincy Jones}. The multi-{tag: Grammy Award} winner also had a long-standing relationship with Frank Sinatra and was the force behind "{track: We Are the World}". {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} spoke to Jones shortly before the release of {album: Michael} and asked him about whether some of these songs were better left unreleased. Jones believes that money will be at the core of lot of decision-making around Jackson's legacy. Jim and Greg also talk to Jones about his latest record {album: Q: Soul Bossa Nostra}, which features Jones tracks updated by {artist: Amy Winehouse,} {artist: Ludacris}, {artist: Talib Kweli} and more.
