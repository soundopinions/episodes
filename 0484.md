# Show 484: The Rock Doctors Cure Heartache & Opinions on Screaming Females

![heartdoctor](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2015/rockdoc_web.jpg)

Jim and Greg don their stethoscopes for another installment of {tag : Rock Doctors}. This time they help a newly divorced patient in need of a jolt of musical adrenaline. Then they review the new album from {place : New Jersey}Â  {genre : punk} band {artist : Screaming Females}.



## 00:02:17 Intro: Music News

![grateful_dead](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/484/3T0.jpg)

{name : Jerry Garcia} may be dead, but we're sure he'd also be grateful for huge outcry of interest from {artist : Grateful Dead} fans for a series of reunion tribute shows in {place : Chicago} this summer. According to {host : Greg}'s reporting for the {tag : *Chicago Tribune*} nearly a half million fans went online at the same time with the hope of paying almost $200 a ticket. Many of them, of course, got shut out and can only hope to score tickets on the secondary market...that is if they are willing to pay $8,000 to $116,000! The show's promoter promises fans they will try to make the experience accessible via the web, but we recommend loading up your generic mp3 device with Dead tunes and heading over to kick back at your favorite (free) outdoor spot as an alternative idyll.

Jim and Greg next give an update on two ongoing court cases in the music world. First, the former British glam star {artist : Gary Glitter} has been sentenced to 16 years in prison after being found guilty of indecently assaulting three girls in the late 1970's. There is no statute of limitations for such offenses in the {place : UK}.

And while less unseemly, the {tag : copyright} case over "{track : Blurred Lines}" is also embarrassing for the artists involved. The trial pits {artist : Robin Thicke} and his co-writers {name : Pharrell Williams} and {name : T.I.} against the family of {artist : Marvin Gaye}.  They, like many people, hear a lot of similarities to Gaye's 1977 hit "{track : Got to Give It Up}." So far the testimonies have been striking. Thicke admitted he was on drugs during the song's recording and that Pharrell was the primary force behind the song. "The biggest hit of my career was written by somebody else, and I was jealous and wanted credit," he testified, "I felt it was a little white lie that didn't hurt his career but boosted mine." No wonder so many of these cases don't make it to a public courtroom.

After decades of being ready to review new releases on a Tuesday, Jim and Greg are preparing for a shift to Friday. But in this digital age, there's not much to prepare. The {tag : International Federation of the Phonographic Industry} announced the decision as a way to eliminate variance from country to country (it's Monday in the {place : UK} and Friday in {place : Germany}). But in a year when {artist : Beyonce} and {artist : Drake} can release music whenever they want with no advance fanfare, this is another example of the music industry being well-behind the times.

{name : Tom Wheeler}, commissioner of the {tag : FCC} delivered a ruling that won in a 3-2 vote to approve strong {tag : Net Neutrality} rules across the country. The Net Neutrality concept posits that the internet should remain a level playing field; certain companies who control data flow cannot show a preference for one company over another due to self interests. {tag : Ars Technica} reporter {name : Jon Brodkin}, joined us to talk about the historic ruling. He doesn't see a downside to the ruling and says that most of the large telecommunication companies will respond with lawsuits. Brodkin adds that the effect on music fans who enjoy streaming services will be largely positive at this point.



## 00:21:18 Rock Doctors: Sandy

Once again, it's time for the **{tag : Rock Doctors}** to put on their white coats and stethoscopes. During this appointment, {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} attempt to mend a broken heart with some great new tunes. Their patient is {tag : Sandy} from {place : Chicago}. She's recently divorced after 17 years of marriage. She wrote Sound Opinions saying it "was an eye-opening and heartbreaking experience." Sandy is now in her early 50s and feels like she "lost or squandered her youth." The doctors' job is to help her awaken her musical self.

Sandy was completely open to new genres of music but tends to favor {genre : classic rock}. Some of her favorite artists include {artist : Led Zeppelin}, {artist : Heart} and {artist : Van Halen}, however she also enjoys more eclectic artists like {artist : St. Vincent} and {artist : tUnE-yArDs}. While she is a consultant by day, she has a background in acting and singing {genre : opera}. Sandy is looking for music that will make her feel a sense of exhilaration like she does when she's performing and making art.

Jim's prescription is the album {album : Show Us Your Mind} from {place : Portland}'s {artist : Summer Cannibals}, while Greg recommended {album : Fantasies} by Canadian {genre : rock} band {artist : Metric}. During their follow-up appointment, Sandy shared that she really enjoyed both records. She liked the strong voices of the female lead singers as well as the instrumentation. Greg and Jim decide that Sandy might be the nicest patient the Rock Doctors have ever treated and are glad to have helped her.

## 00:49:00 Review: Screaming Females

![Rose Mountain](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/484/29O0.jpg)

Coming out of the {tag : DIY} scene of suburban {place : New Jersey}, {artist : Screaming Females} has built a dedicated following over the last decade behind the strength of force-of-nature singer/guitarist {name : Marissa Paternoster}. For their 6th album, {album : Rose Mountain}, they've turned to a big name producer for the first time in the form of {name : Matt Bayles}, best known for his work with {artist : Mastodon} and {artist : The Sword}. The result is a catchier and more melodic record than ever before. But {host : Greg} thinks that comes at a cost: the conventionality has masked Paternoster's powerful emotions. While it's a great stepping stone album for new fans, Greg suggests the three previous records better show off her personality. He gives it a {tag : Try It}. {host : Jim}, on the other hand, sees the changes in the sound as a real step toward maturity. You can only be a raging 16-year-old for so long, after all. The lyrics are intense and the catharsis comes out in Paternoster's amazing guitar solos. For Jim, *Rose Mountain* is an enthusiastic {tag : Buy It}.
