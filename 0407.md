## 00:01:49 News: 09-13-2013
The {genre: EDM} business is booming. Just check out our [feature](/show/341/) on it. It's grown into a $4.5 billion industry and now has the attention of {name: Wall Street}. {name: SFX Entertainment} has plans to acquire promoters and sponsors and take EDM to the arenas. It hopes to raise as much as $300 million through its upcoming I.P.O., yet according to a recent {name: New York Times} [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/arts/music/drugs-at-music-festivals-are-threat-to-investors-as-well-as-fans.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0), a string of deaths related to the drug {name: MDMA} (or Molly) may complicate the genre's appeal.

## 00:03:57 Interview: Cheap Trick
35 years ago some boys from Rockford, IL headed over to {place: Japan} to play some shows. Since they didn't have much fame in the U.S., they never expected to be mobbed by 5,000 fans at the [airport](http://www.tokyo-airport-bldg.co.jp/en/), a la {artist: The Beatles}. But, now, of course, {artist: Cheap Trick} is a household name in its own country. The live recording {album: At Budokan} went on to sell over 3 million copies. Cheap Trick members {name: Robin Zander}, guitarist {name: Rick Nielsen}, bassist {name: Tom Petersson} and Nielsen's son {name: Daxx} (sitting in for Bun E. Carlos on drums) give us live *At Budokan* [live on Sound Opinions](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz9W8F2PZCOoqAHaQNexg8spc_q8JLBlI) and talk about the decision to travel overseas, meeting idols like {artist: Fats Domino} and why they are the band that will steal your guitar, but never your girlfriend. 

## 00:43:57 Review: Janelle Monáe
![The Electric Lady](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/63/bf/f4/63bff401-07ff-5eb4-3be6-a71940f6199e/source/600x600bb.jpg "140777342/665514095")
{artist: Janelle Monáe} wowed {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} with her 2010 album {album: The ArchAndroid}. Apparently she wowed the likes of {artist: Erykah Badu} and {artist: Prince} too, because they are just some of the guest stars on her new release {album: The Electric Lady}. But unfortunately, none of these collaborators helped Monáe edit herself. Jim and Greg [love](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-09-08/entertainment/chi-janelle-monae-electric-lady-review-20130908_1_archandroid-janelle-monae-ep-metropolis) tracks like "{track: Givin Em What They Love}" and "{track: Dance Apocalyptic}," but they also hear some real mistakes. Jim would include some of the non-musical interludes among them. {album: The Electric Lady} gets a double {tag: Burn It}.

## 00:50:37 DIJ: Jim
Last week Greg gave some love to our friends down under and chose a track by the {place: Australian} group {artist: The Go-Betweens}. But, Jim was hoping he'd go right to the band that intro's this segment: {artist: The Saints}. So this week he drops a coin in the Desert Island Jukebox and chooses the ultimate anti-advertising song: "{track: Know Your Product}" from {era: 1978}. And after this, Sound Opinions H.Q. is expecting a free trip to {place: Brisbane}.
