# Show 850: X-Ray Spex & the Power of Poly Styrene, Opinions on Saba & Shamir

Poly Styrene led X-Ray Spex in the punk explosion of the late 1970s and inspired a generation of riot grrrls in the 1990s. Hosts Jim DeRogatis and Greg Kot talk with her daughter, Celeste Bell, about her new documentary, "Poly Styrene: I Am A Cliché." They also do a classic album dissection of the X-Ray Spex album "Germ-Free Adolescents" and review new albums from Saba and Shamir. Join our Facebook Group: https://bit.ly/3sivr9TBecome a member on Patreon: https://bit.ly/3slWZvcSign up for our newsletter: https://bit.ly/3eEvRnGMake a donation via PayPal: https://bit.ly/3dmt9lURecord a Voice Memo: https://bit.ly/2RyD5Ah Featured Songs:X-Ray Spex, "Oh Bondage, Up Yours!," Germfree Adolescents, EMI, 1978Saba, "Survivor's Guilt (feat.
