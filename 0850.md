Poly Styrene led X-Ray Spex in the punk explosion of the late 1970s and inspired a generation of riot grrrls in the 1990s. Hosts Jim DeRogatis and Greg Kot talk with her daughter, Celeste Bell, about her new documentary, "Poly Styrene: I Am A Cliché." They also do a classic album dissection of the X-Ray Spex album "Germ-Free Adolescents" and review new albums from Saba and Shamir.
