# Show 102: Spoon & Opinions on Jay Z
{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} welcome {genre: indie rock}ers {artist: Spoon} to perform songs from their new album {album: Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga}. They'll also review the latest from {genre: hip hop} mogul {artist: Jay Z}.

## 00:01:45 News: 11.09.07
First up {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} talk about {artist: Matchbox Twenty}. That's right, Matchbox Twenty. But it isn't the {genre: adult contemporary} gods' music our hosts are interested in; it's their new album release strategy. Rob Thomas and company are releasing 11 versions of their new album {album: Exile on Mainstream} including a {tag: USB} bracelet, {tag: iTunes} bundle, {tag: VH1} stream, and a good old-fashioned CD. It is certainly out-of-the-box thinking for the band's label, but it remains to be seen how fans will respond.

Another novel approach to music marketing is the fusion of rock and...{tag: video games}. {tag: Guitar Hero III} recently hit the stores, and in just seven days it made over $100 million. The game is selling for much more than a standard CD, but as Jim and Greg explain, those numbers are higher than most bands can boast. In 2006, the video game industry made 12.5 billion dollars, while the music industry was down to 12 billion and sinking. This fact hasn't gone unnoticed by labels, and now many bands are using games like Guitar Hero to promote themselves. This version contains tracks by the {artist: Beastie Boys}, {artist: Weezer} and {artist: Smashing Pumpkins}, and {artist: The Sex Pistols} even re-recorded their anti-capitalist {genre: punk} anthem "{track: Anarchy in the U.K.}" just for the game. Call them out-of-touch, but Jim and Greg wonder why rock fans aren't just picking up a real guitar?

The {artist:Eagles} also had a successful week. Their new album, the first in studio effort in 28 years, hit the #1 spot on the Billboard Chart. This was due to a change in chart policies. Previously {tag: Nielsen SoundScan} didn't include sales figures from individual retailers. But, now that artists are striking exclusive deals with outlets like Target, Starbucks, and in this case, {tag: Wal-Mart}, the band was able to beat out Britney and score the year's second-best selling album.

## 00:09:03 Review: Eagles
![Long Road Out of Eden](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/bb/4c/61/bb4c6128-ab0a-5a70-3977-ee7a2fd1674b/source/600x600bb.jpg "1208210099/1208209658")

So consumers are excited about {album: Long Road Out of Eden}, but how do Jim and Greg feel? Greg explains that with the exception of mentions of "cell phones" and "SUV's," this album could just as easily have been made in 1980 as 2007. {name: Don Henley} and {name: Glenn Frey} are still up to their old tricks, mixing {genre: country} and {genre: rock} with a hint of sentimentality. In fact, while their country-rock fusion sound was radical in the {era: 1970s}, it's the norm in {place: Nashville} today. {host: Greg} hears nothing on this record that needs hearing, and recommends fans of the band check out their {era: 1990} greatest hits album. {host: Jim} completely agrees; he doesn't want to hear Don Henley preaching about the sorry state of the world, particularly when the band agreed to sell its soul to Wal-Mart. But, more egregious than the terrible lyrics is the sleepy sound. The {artist: Eagles} managed to be both irritating and boring, so they get a double {tag: Trash It}.

## 00:21:45 Interview: Spoon
One of {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}'s favorite albums of the year so far comes from the indie rock band {artist: Spoon}. Despite the odd title, they fell for the combination of minimal {genre: art pop} with {name: Phil Spector}-like arrangements and orchestrations. This is the band's sixth album, and the fourth they've made with indie label {label: Merge} (also home to another indie success story -- {artist: Arcade Fire}). Jim and Greg start by asking lead singer and songwriter {name: Britt Daniel} about the approach to this album. He explains that the band was definitely inspired by {genre: Motown} groups like {artist: The Supremes} -- something that may come as a surprise to fans who are used to a sparser sound.

One of the people responsible for the "Spoon sound" is producer {name: Mike McCarthy}. But, the band also worked with {name: Jon Brion} on a couple of songs. Other surprising influences: {artist: Queen} and {artist: AC/DC}. Songs like "{track: We Will Rock You}," and "{track: Back in Black}," are fairly simple and minimal, but they have that rhythm and that "thing" that draw you in. Listen to Spoon's take on that "thing" in the songs "{track: Don't Make Me a Target}," "{track: Rhythm and Soul}," and "{track: Don't You Evah}." 

## 00:48:06 Review: Jay Z
![American Gangster (Acappella)](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music49/v4/b5/2e/6c/b52e6cad-b7b4-20ee-e232-31a14fb2f97d/source/600x600bb.jpg "112080/268930924")

This week {artist: Jay Z} releases his tenth album, {album: American Gangster}. Inspired by the movie of the same name, the current king of {genre: hip hop} (and possibly of all time), brings another dose of gangsta stories told with his trademark flow. In 2003, the rapper "retired," and then un-retired. His return album, {album: Kingdom Come}, was a major disappointment to Jim and Greg, but {host: Greg} for one is pleased with what he's hearing on {album: American Gangster}. The stories are nothing new, but Greg loves the way Jay-Z crafts them. He is also returning to the {era: '70s} {tag: blaxploitation} sound that infused one of his best albums, {album: The Blueprint}. While the mogul certainly doesn't need any cash, Greg gives this album a {tag: Buy It}. {host: Jim} is less enthused. He loves the production, and was shocked to hear great beats from {name: Sean "Diddy" Combs}, but the lyrics are too much of a hurdle for him to get over. He wishes Jay Z's ideas were as complex and nuanced as those in the movie {tag: American Gangster} and only gives the record a {tag: Try It}.
