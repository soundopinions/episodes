# Show 656: Hinds & Opinions on Beyoncé and Jay-Z, Parquet Courts & More

![Hinds](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2018/hinds.jpg)

{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} talk with two members of the Spanish women {genre: rock} band {artist: Hinds} about their unique take on {genre: punk rock} and how they've reached fans in {place: America} and the {place: U.K.} Also, with an influx of new releases, it's time for a review round-up! Jim and Greg give their opinions on new albums from {artist: Beyoncé} and {artist: Jay-Z}, {artist: Neko Case} and {artist: Parquet Courts}.

## 00:01:31 Review: Beyoncé & Jay-Z: The Carters
![EVERYTHING IS LOVE](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/656/2J0.jpg)

{artist: Beyoncé} and {artist: Jay-Z} released what they're calling the third installment of a trilogy of albums. {album: Everything Is Love}, which they released as {artist: The Carters}, is a joint work in which they reflect on art, black excellence, personal drama and luxury. It follows Beyoncé's {album: Lemonade} (2016) and Jay-Z's {album: 4:44} (2017). {host: Greg} thinks there are good moments on Everything Is Love, like Beyoncé's singing on "{track: FRIENDS}" and Jay-Z owning up to his transgressions. However, he believes this record is merely a PR effort to get people to buy tickets to their concert, and this album doesn't say nearly as much as the previous ones. He gives it a {tag: Trash It}. {host: Jim} agrees in many respects. He loved Lemonade because Beyoncé sung honestly and beautifully about her personal issues as well as bigger picture themes like how black women are treated in society and the {tag: Black Lives Matter} movement. He wishes there was more substance on this record, and thinks Jay-Z hasn't been at the height of his rap game since the {era: early 2000s}. Jim gives the album a {tag: Trash It}.

## 00:10:28 Review: Parquet Courts
![Wide Awake!](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/656/HG0.jpg)
 
{genre: Indie} rock band {artist: Parquet Courts} is back with {album: Wide Awake!}, their first album since 2014. Jim thinks they are the perfect slacker band, and their lyrics come equipped with plenty of socialist rhetoric. He adds that "They've got a formula, and they work it, and it's delightful every time."
Greg, agrees that they have a solid {genre: punk rock} formula; however, he thinks that this record does show growth, particularly in their work with producer {name: Brian Burton}, also known as {artist: Danger Mouse}. Songs like {track: Wide Awake} bring in {genre: funky} "danceable elements"; and he was also surprised to find "tenderness" on tracks like {track: Back To Earth}. Both {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} give Wide Awake! a {tag: Buy It}.


## 00:18:30 Review: Neko Case
![Hell-On](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/656/UU0.jpg)

{artist: Neko Case} brings us a new {genre: Americana}/{genre: alt-country} exploration of Mother Nature's edgy side with {album: Hell-On}, her seventh solo album. Greg notes that though other people collaborate with her (including {name: Bjorn Yttling} of {artist: Peter Bjorn & John}, who served as co-producer on six tracks), she is the writer of these songs, he is the main instrumentalist on her record, and she is a producer. "This is her baby," he asserts, "You can bring on anybody, and it's still going to sound like a Neko Case record because of her massive role in how it sounds."  The album provides what Jim thinks is one of her best lyrics ever on {track: My Uncle's Navy}, about a relative that used to mutilate animals. Jim wonders if "that's what sent Neko down this strange nature path." However, Jim says that ultimately, this is "merely a very good Neko Case record." {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} give the album a Double {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:27:14 Interview: Hinds
![Hinds](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/656/19E0.jpg)

This week, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} are joined by the two leading members of the Spanish {genre: rock} band {artist: Hinds}! {name: Carlotta Cosials} and {name: Ana Perrote} are from {place: Madrid} where women-led rock bands are extremely uncommon. They tought themselves how to play and sing in their late teens and formed the band, choosing to sing their songs in english in the hopes of reaching audiences outside of Spain. It worked! Hinds regularly plays sold-out shows in the U.S. and has released two successful albums, {album: Leave Me Alone} (2016) and {album: I Don't Run} (2018). We talked to Ana and Carlotta about how they write their brand of rock and roll, how they perceive America and about navigating the music industry.
