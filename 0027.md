## 00:02:01 News: 06-03-06
A story out of the British press tickled {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}'s fancy this week. {place: England}'s Essex FM decided to launch a boycott of recent {genre: pop} phenomenon {artist: James Blunt}. Blunt, apparently peeved by critics bashing him, instructed the haters to just stop playing his music. {tag: Essex FM} gladly took the challenge and banned both of his hit singles from their airwaves. Sound Opinions would like to encourage all radio programmers to take Blunt up on his challenge. And while we are at it, there are a few other overplayed radio hits we'd like to discuss... 

{place: Finland} loves its masked {genre: death metal} bands. Finnish band {artist: Lordi}, who recently won the {tag: Eurovision} prize, became the source of a recent uproar when the lead singer was "unmasked" by two tabloid newspapers. Fans of the masked rockers were so upset by this disrespectful move that over 200,000 of them have signed a petition forcing one of the tabloids to apologize. Sound Opinions fans need not fear however: The true identities of Jim and Greg will never be revealed.

In some sad news, {name: Desmond Dekker} died this week at the age of 63. Dekker is credited with bringing the {genre: ska} and {genre: reggae} sounds of {place: Jamaica} to the West, most notably with the hit "{track: Israelites}." Dekker influenced fellow countryman {artist: Bob Marley}, but his impact in the U.S. and England was most notable in the ska scene. You can still hear Dekker's sound in the music of bands like {artist: The Clash}, {artist: the Sex Pistols} and more recently, {artist: No Doubt} and {artist: Less than Jake}. 

## 00:11:12 List: Rock En Español
This week Jim and Greg take a musical trip around {place: Latin America} to explore the world of {genre: Rock en Español}. Their tour guide is music writer {name: Ernesto Lechner}, author of {tag: Rock en Español: The Latin Alternative Rock Explosion}. Here are some of the key bands you might want to check out:

1. {artist: Os Mutantes}
1. {artist: Los Fabulosos Cadillacs} 
1. {artist: Maldita Vecindad}
1. {artist: Café Tacuba}

## 00:39:25 Review: Elvis Costello
![The River In Reverse (Digital Version)](//static.soundopinions.org/assets/27/1TP0.jpg "497911/157144767")
{artist: Elvis Costello}, the {genre: singer/songwriter} who has taken on {genre: New Wave}, {genre: punk}, {genre: ska}, {genre: country} and {genre: pop}, is tackling {genre: R&B} on his latest release, {album: The River in Reverse}. The album is a collaboration between Costello and {artist: Allen Toussaint}, the multi-talented {place: New Orleans} musician. Toussaint is responsible for hits like "{track: Working in a Coal Mine}," "{track: I Like It Like That}," and "{track: Lady Marmalade}," and has worked with {artist: The Band}, {artist: Paul Simon} and {artist: The Meters}. The two collaborated after {tag: Hurricane Katrina} hit New Orleans, but neither {host: Jim} nor {host: Greg} think Costello's voice is up to the task of handling Toussaint's songs. Costello is a name that can garner attention for Toussaint, and Greg knows that his heart is in the right place, but it is only a {tag: Burn It} record for both critics.

## 00:47:49 Review: The Coup
![Pick a Bigger Weapon](//static.soundopinions.org/assets/27/27P0.jpg "28436379/272782166")
Switching gears, Jim and Greg next discuss {album: Pick a Bigger Weapon}, the fifth album from {genre: hip-hop} group {artist: The Coup}. They play a bit of "{track: Laugh, Love, F@#*k}" which sets the tone of the record according to Jim. The Coup is known for their [lefist](http://rapgenius.com/The-coup-5-million-ways-to-kill-a-ceo-lyrics) politics and {genre: electro-synth} grooves, but this record was mostly recorded live. Rapper {name: Boots Riley} and DJ {name: Pam the Funkstress} are joined by {name: Tom Morello}, {name: Dwayne Wiggins} and members of {artist: Maze} and {artist: The Gap Band} for a {genre: funk}ier, {genre: psychedelic} sound. {host: Greg} hears great grooves and enjoys how, like Desmond Dekker, The Coup combine politics with party music, but he can't really recommend most of {album: Pick a Bigger Weapon}. {host: Jim} believes he is being too kind. He explains that lyrically, many of the songs pander to the lowest common denominator, and he wishes that the grooves were tighter and more hypnotic. Therefore, this record gets a {tag: Burn It} from Mr. Kot and a {tag: Trash It} from Mr. DeRogatis.

## 00:54:56 DIJ: Greg
Drawing inspiration from the discussion with {name: Ernesto Lechner}, Greg chooses {artist: Beck}'s "{track: Tropicalia}" as his {tag: Desert Island Jukebox} pick. The notion that people were ever jailed or sent into exile for playing {genre: Tropicalia} music in {place: Brazil} got this host all fired up -- especially because this music, pioneered by artists like {artist: Caetano Veloso} and {artist: Gilberto Gil}, has remained such a formative influence on contemporary artists. Beck displays his love for the tropicalistas in this song from his 1998 album {album: Mutations} (a nod to fellow Brazilians Os Mutantes). Beck combines the {genre: Bossa Nova} chords and gentle singing of Tropicalia music with {genre: art rock} guitar and synthesizer. The result is a perfect example of Beck's {genre: pop} collage style and a perfect homage to his Brazilian heroes.
