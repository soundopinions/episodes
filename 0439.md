# Show 439: Songs That Make You Cry

![Tearjerkers](http://static.soundopinions.org/images/2014/crying_web2.jpg)

Get out your hankies! We've got the best musical "{tag: Tearjerkers}." Then, Jim and Greg review the first record in over 15 years from  {artist: The Afghan Whigs}.

## 00:02:07 News: 04.25.14
In the week's most unexpected news, {artist: Prince} has reconciled with {label: Warner Music} after a two-decade split. Fans may remember their public kerfuffle in {era: 1996}, when the star scrawled "[SLAVE](http://www.thatericalper.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/prince_cheek.jpg)" across his face, changed his name to the unpronounceable [Love Symbol](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/af/Prince_logo.svg), and otherwise acted out until the label released him from his contract. But independence wasn't quite the salvation Prince expected, and his album sales faltered. Now Prince has the promotional power of {label: Warner Bros.} back on his side. Plus, he regains control over his catalog, just in time to reissue a 30th-anniversary edition of {album: Purple Rain}. It's a shrewd business move—or, as {host: Jim} suggests, maybe a form of Stockholm syndrome.

Over the years, Sound Opinions has witnessed endless battles over pop music {tag: piracy}, from the [Pirate Bay](/show/178/) to [Limewire](/show/287/) to the aforementioned [Purple One](/show/101/). Now digital theft has spread to the {tag: theatre}. {tag: *Wicked*} composer {name: Stephen Schwartz} and other prominent {tag: Broadway} writers have learned that thousands of fans are downloading their sheet music illegally, thus keeping them from thousands of royalty dollars. But instead of rushing to file copyright lawsuits (à la the {tag: RIAA} and so many record labels), the composers have taken a more compassionate route, emailing downloaders one-by-one to let them know how piracy hurts them. To that, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} cheer: "Bravissimo!"

## 00:49:52 Review: The Afghan Whigs
![Do to the Beast](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music4/v4/07/af/5c/07af5c44-54d4-e606-64d6-75b23e6f60a0/source/600x600bb.jpg "483354/815358143")
After almost 16 years, {host: Greg} was genuinely excited to learn about the return of {name: Greg Dulli} and {artist: The Afghan Whigs}. He always loved the {name: Jim Thompson}-like storytelling in the songs, and the {genre: R&B} exuberance of Dulli's on-stage persona. But, {album: Do to the Beast} is a somewhat mixed return to form. The Whigs are missing their original guitarist and drummer. So Greg says {tag: Try It}. {host: Jim} is not so kind. He was never as taken with {artist: Greg Dulli}'s "schtick" and thinks the record is a poor imitation of other great R&B-tinged albums. He gives {album: Do to the Beast} a {tag: Trash It} rating.
