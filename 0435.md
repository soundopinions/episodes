# Show 435: The Allman Brothers Band & Black Lips Review

![Allman Brothers](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2014/allmanbros_web.jpg)

For 45 years {artist: The Allman Brothers Band} has survived murder, mayhem, death, and addictions. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} speak with {name: Alan Paul}, author of *One Way Out: The Inside History of the Allman Brothers Band*. Later they review the new album from Georgia punk rockers {artist: The Black Lips}.


## 00:02:21 News: 03.28.14
{artist: Eminem} is having a good week. He was not only announced as a headliner at this summer's {name: Lollapalooza}, but his {album: Marshall Mathers LP 2} album hit the two million mark in sales. This puts him in the rarefied air of only one other artist in the {tag: SoundScan} era. (The other is the {artist: Backstreet Boys}.) His cumulative sales are approaching 50 million, making him the 2nd best-selling male artist of the SoundScan era behind {artist: Garth Brooks}. 

{name: Irving Azoff} is one of the most powerful men in the history of music. He managed careers of bands like {artist: The Eagles}, {artist: Van Halen}, and{artist:  Steely Dan}. He was also the CEO of {tag: Ticketmaster} and the chairman of {tag: LiveNation}. Now, he is has brokered a big deal involving…{name: Phil Jackson}? Azoff is a former partner of New York Knicks CEO {name: James Dolan}, and he told {tag: Bloomberg News} that he helped broker the deal to bring Jackson to the Knicks. But, he can join Spike courtside whenever he wants.

## 00:07:06 Interview: Alan Paul on The Allman Brothers Band
 This year {artist: The Allman Brothers Band} will celebrate its {tag: 45th anniversary}, and sources say this year may be the band's last. In fact, due to Greg Allman's bronchitis, it remains to be seen when the band can close out its residency at the famed {place: Beacon Theater} in {place: New York}. But, after four decades, fans still shelled out upwards of $6,000 to get a ticket to the Beacon gigs. The Allmans still captivate, and for good reason, according to {name: Alan Paul}. He's a senior writer at *Guitar World* and the author of the *New York Times* bestselling biography *One Way Out: The Inside History of The Allman Brothers Band*. Alan talks with Jim and Greg about the band's unique mix of blues, jazz, country and psychedelic rock, and their quintessntially American lineup, in which bigger was better. The Allman Brothers Band had two {tag: guitartist}s, {name: Duane Allman} and {name: Dickey Betts}, and two {tag: drummer}s, {name: Butch Trucks} and {name: Jaimoe Johansen}. Rounding out the group at its formation was {tag: bassist} {name: Berry Oakley}. But since {era: 1969}, there have been a number of personnel changes and dramatic ups and downs, including the loss of Duane only two years years into the band's lifespan. But, despite all odds, as Alan explains, The Allman Brothers Band has maintained its vision and its soul (except for that whole [keytar](http://youtu.be/Cq4nx_Vvt_Y?t=2m14s) incident).

## 00:48:31 Review: Black Lips
![Underneath the Rainbow (Bonus Track Version)](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/435/28V0.jpg)
The incendiary live shows and southern {genre: punk} sound of {artist: Black Lips} have been hallmarks of the band for over a decade. With their latest album, {album: Underneath the Rainbow}, the {place: Atlanta}, GA rockers take a turn for the mature. {name: Patrick Carney} of {artist: The Black Keys} and {name: Thomas Brenneck} of {artist: The Dap-Kings} were recruited to take turns producing, and {host: Jim} notices the difference. The sound is cleaner than previous Black Lips outings, but still retains the same killer {genre: garage rock} melodies. {album: Underneath the Rainbow} wins a heartfelt {tag: Buy It} from Jim.  {host: Greg} thinks cleaning up is the last thing the band needs to do. They're at their best when they are raw, loud and are not playing nice. Greg hears the compromises {host: Underneath the Rainbow}, and says {tag: Trash It}.
