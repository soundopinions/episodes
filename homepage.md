Dear Listeners,
Now that the show is independent, we're inviting you to join the band and lend a hand! We need your support more than ever because now we have to do all the behind-the-scenes work ourselves (like buying insurance and paying for podcast hosting). 

Please consider [becoming a Sound Opinions member by giving whatever you can via Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/soundopinions?fan_landing=true) or with a one-time donation through PayPal. Thanks for listening, and thanks for your support!
