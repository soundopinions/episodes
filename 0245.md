# Show 245: Chess Records & Opinions on Dark Night of the Soul
{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} explore the history and influence of {label: Chess Records}. During its 25 year run, the {place: Chicago} label put out music by {artist: Bo Diddley}, {artist: Chuck Berry} and {artist: Muddy Waters}â€”forever changing the sound of {genre: rock and roll}.

## 00:01:45 News: 8.6.2010
{tag: *American Idol*} is currently on summer vacation, but they've still been making quite a bit of news. The pop music contest and music industry juggernaut has decided to take its business to {label: Universal Music} and away from {label: Sony}. In years past, the show's winners and runners-up released albums on Sony under the direction of powerhouse {artist: Clive Davis}. Now it appears that {label: Interscope} executive {artist: Jimmy Iovine} will become the new mentor. In addition, both {name: Simon Cowell } and {name: Ellen DeGeneres} are out as hosts. {name: Kara DioGuardi} may also be leaving. In their place? Possibly {name: Jennifer Lopez} and {name: Steven Tyler}. And, since it's been years since Idol produced a {artist: Carrie Underwood} or {artist: Kelly Clarkson}, hopefully these changes will mean more exciting winners as well.

It doesn't look like we can count on an  "Iranian Idol"  anytime soon. {place: Iran}'s supreme leader, {name: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei}, made a strong statement against music this week, proclaiming that it is "not compatible" with the values of the {tag: Islamic republic}. Many are seeing this as leading to an outright ban of music in Iran and an expression of Khamenei's long-held mistrust of Western cultural influence. As rock evangelists, this attitude toward music is, of course, disheartening to Jim and Greg. For more on rebel culture in Iran check out {artist: Marjane Satrapi} graphic novel and film {tag: *Persepolis*} and the Cannes winner {tag: *No One Knows About Persian Cats*}.

## 00:06:12 Special: Chess Records
A couple of months ago {host: Jim}, {host: Greg} and some {tag: WBEZ} listeners visited {place: 2120 S. Michigan}: the home of Chicago's famed {label: Chess Records}. Unfortunately, this was a rare treat. Despite two recent movies, both the museum and the label often don't get their due. Jim and Greg wanted to take an episode to talk about the history and legacy of Chess. During its brief 25-year run, it produced records by heavyweights like {artist: Muddy Waters}, {artist: Buddy Guy} and {artist: Chuck Berry}. That music went on to {tag: influence} British rockers like {artist: Eric Clapton}, {artist: Jeff Beck} and {artist: Jimi Hendrix}. In fact, the {artist: Rolling Stones} even made a pilgrimage to the studios to record with Waters. Here are the artists Jim and Greg highlight:

### Chess Records artists
- {artist: Muddy Waters}
- {artist: Willie Dixon}
- {artist: Chuck Berry}
- {artist: Howlin' Wolf}
- {artist: Little Walter}
- {artist: Sonny Boy Williamson}
- {artist: Bobby Charles}
- {artist: Buddy Guy}

## 00:46:44 Review: Dark Night of the Soul
![Dark Night of the Soul](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fc/Dark_Night_of_the_Soul.jpg "110951238/693812409")
A year after it was supposed to be released, {album: Dark Night of the Soul} is finally here. The record is a collaboration between {tag: producer} {artist: Danger Mouse}, {tag: singer}/{tag: songwriter} {artist: Mark Linkous}, aka {artist: Sparklehorse}, and {tag: director} {artist: David Lynch}. Sadly, Linkous committed suicide last year, as did one of the album's contributors {artist: Vic Chestnutt}. The finished product is disjointed, according to {host: Greg}. There are a couple of standout tracks (no thanks to Lynch), but he can only give it a {tag: Burn It} rating. {host: Jim} agrees, noting that it's sad that Linkous himself wasn't able to sing more of the material. He also gives {album: Dark Night of the Soul} a {tag: Burn It}.
