## 00:01:51 List: Off the Rails
{tag: Sound Opinions} is a show that celebrates music. But, once in a while we have to get a little negative and call out artists that disappoint us. In particular, there's a crop of singers and musicians who began as great talents with promising careers, but ended up breaking our hearts by going "{tag: Off the Rails}."

## 00:40:03 Review: Big Boi
![Sir Lucious Left Foot... The Son of Chico Dusty (Deluxe Edition)](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/242/1UR0.jpg)
{artist: Outkast} {tag: rapper} {artist: Big Boi} has released his first solo album called...wait for it... {album: Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty}. Big Boi is often thought of as the more down to earth of the two {place: Atlanta} {genre: hip hop} artists, but both {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} think the record is very inventive and ambitious. {host: Greg} does miss {name: Andre 3000}'s presence, and thinks the two make each other better. But overall, Sir Lucious Left Foot is full of great beats and oddball touches and gets a {tag: Buy It} rating. {host: Jim} agrees and was pleasantly surprised to hear these tracks, especially after all the torture that went into making it. It has a tad too many vulgar and juvenile lyrics, but he still thinks listeners should {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:47:37 Review: Alejandro Escovedo
![Street Songs of Love (Bonus Track Version)](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/242/27D0.jpg)
{artist: Alejandro Escovedo} has been making music since the 1970's, but this past decade has brought him his highest profile to date. The {place: Texas}-based rocker's new record is {album: Street Songs of Love}, a concept album about rock's favorite topic: love. But, Jim feels like he's heard these songs before, particularly the mid-tempo classic groove. This is not Escovedo at his best, according to {host: Jim}, who gives it a {tag: Burn It}. {host: Greg} thinks it's easy to be let down because Escovedo is such a smart lyricist, but the more he listened, the more he liked it. Greg thinks the singer/songwriter is that rare artist who has gotten better with age and gives Street Songs of Love a {tag: Buy It}.
