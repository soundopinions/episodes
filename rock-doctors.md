# Rock Doctors

Unless you are a full-time rock critic, it can be difficult to maintain good musical health. That's where the {tag: Rock Doctors} come in. Do you have a musical allergy or addiction? Or do you have a friend or relative who needs an intervention?

The Sound Opinions clinic has its doors open. Drs. Jim DeRogatis and Greg Kot see patients a few times a year. To request an appointment, fill out this form in details. **Maybe** the Doctors will see you soon.
