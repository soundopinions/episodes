## 00:00:50 Review: Kelela
![kelela](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2023/raven.webp)
{artist: Kelela} has kept fans of her electronic dance and R&B music waiting for six years for her second official album, {album: Raven}. In the meantime, her music has become a staple of queer dance parties everywhere. Jim and Greg are both big fans of Raven.

## 00:08:14 Review: Yo La Tengo

![Yo La Tengo This Stupid World](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/902/DQ5.jpg)

{artist: Yo La Tengo} is nearing 40 years as a band. They have grown to be synonymous with indie rock. On their 17th album, {album: This Stupid World}, the core trio did everything themselves. Jim and Greg attempt to calibrate their review to take their personal preference for the band into account, but still can’t give the album anything but a rave review. 

## 00:16:03 Feature: Latino Fans of British Bands

Dr. Ricky Rodríguez grew up in a Mexican-American household, but found his musical community when he heard British music from the post-punk era, like {artist: Siousixie and the Banshees} and {artist: Frankie Goes To Hollywood}. His book, “A Kiss Across The Ocean” examines the cultural exchange that blossomed in that era between British bands and {tag: Latino} and Latina fans.
