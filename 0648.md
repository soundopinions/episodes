## 00:41:04 Review: Lucy Dacus
![Historian](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/648/1WG0.jpg)
{artist: Lucy Dacus} made a big splash with her first release, 2016's {album: No Burden}. {album: Historian} is the sophomore album from the {genre: indie} {genre: singer-songwriter}, who delivers the same thoughtful lyrics and quiet moments. According to Greg, one of the standout tracks on this album is "{track: Pillar of Truth}." "Pillar" clocks in at over 7 minutes and "just builds and builds to that moment when Dacus raises her voice for basically the first and only time on the album." {host: Greg} adds that though {album: No Burden} got a lot of acclaim, "{album: Historian} is a better album." He gives it an enthusiastic {tag: Buy It}. Jim concedes that he also "loves when the songs build, but he wants the whole album to be that way." He says that there are great lines, but he doesn't "share the level of enthusiam" [that Greg has for the record]. {host: Jim} gives the album a {tag: Try It}.


## 00:48:06 Feature: Hooked On Sonics: Torres
![Torres](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/648/2860.jpg)
"The first time I heard that song, it was one of those drop everything kind of moments" is how singer and songwriter {name: Mackenzie Scott} - AKA {artist: Torres} - explains the moment she heard "{track: The Phantom of the Opera}." For our occasional series {tag: Hooked on Sonics}, we talk with musicians about the song that inspired them to start singing, pick up an instrument, or write a song. When Torres first heard this work by {name: Andrew Lloyd Weber} around the age of 14, "something flipped" and she wanted to sing. She says the pairing of melody and harsh sounds in Phantom is something she tries to capture in her own music.
