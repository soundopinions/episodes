## 00:00:00 Review: The Cure

![cure](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2024/the-cure.jpeg)

{artist : The Cure} have released their fourteenth studio album, “{album : Songs of a Lost World}.” Jim and Greg say it was worth the wait and fits with the band's early drone-based work.



## 00:08:00 Review: Amyl and the Sniffers

![amyl](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2024/amyl.jpg)

{artist : Amyl and The Sniffers} are a confrontational punk band from Australia. Their new album “{album : Cartoon Darkness}” is their third, and delivers attitude in spades from frontwoman Amy Taylor.



## 00:15:00 Review: Tyler, The Creator

{artist : Tyler, The Creator}'s new album “{album : Chromakopia}” is his eighth and features several samples from his mother. The hosts applaud his efforts to present a more well-rounded image of himself and including the perspectives of women on this strong project.



## 00:00:00 Interview: Verböten

![verboten](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2024/verboten.png)

Jason Narducy and Tracey Bradford join us to talk about the punk band they formed in 1982, Verböten. Though the group broke up in 1983, they made a big impression on Tracey's cousin, Dave Grohl. Grohl told that story in his 2014 documentary, “Sonic Highways,” which led to Verböten the musical, which Jason Narducy wrote original songs for. That musical inspired the old bandmates to reunite and finally write and record a full length album and perform at Riot Fest 2024.
