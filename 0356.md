## 00:01:45 News: 9.21.2012
This week, the {tag: BBC} and {tag: British} monitoring service {tag: Musicmetric} released the most in-depth {tag: study} yet of global {tag: file-sharing} habits. The report confirms some common knowledge, but as Jim and Greg point out, it also contains a few surprises. We already knew the U.S. led the world in BitTorrent downloads, but who knew Drake was our most pirated artist? (Canadians seem to be returning the compliment - their most pirated artist is Kanye). The BBC's city-by-city breakdown  of the U.K.'s most-pirated artists is even more intriguing. We should've known teen pop juggernaut Justin Bieber would claim a few towns (Oxfordshire and Great Yarmouth) but who knew Isle of Wight residents loved Louis Armstrong so much?

## 00:03:28 Interview: El-P
{artist: El-P}, aka {name: Jaime Meline}, joins Jim and Greg in the Sound Opinions studio this week. Take a look at any of the underground {genre: hip-hop} that came out of {place: New York} in late '{era: 90s}, and chances are you'll find El-P somewhere in the background. As a {tag: rapper}, {tag: producer}, and head of the indie record label {label: Definitive Jux}, El-P has left an indelible mark on New York hip-hop. And he's not slowing up anytime soon. This year, El-P produced {artist: Killer Mike}'s {album: R.A.P. Music} and his own solo album, {album: Cancer 4 Cure}. El-P grew up in {place: Brooklyn} during hip-hop's golden age in the eighties. By 1993 he'd founded his own group, {artist: Company Flow}. He tells Jim and Greg how creating the track "{track: Last Good Sleep}," for their sophomore album, {album: Funcrusher Plus}, transformed his approach to songwriting. The more specific and personal the story, El says, the more universal. Today, even El-P's "political" songs are more about internal struggles than external ones. In fact the title for his record, Cancer 4 Cure, is inspired by the idea that our bodies are constantly fighting off an illness latent inside us. Not to suggest that Cancer 4 Cure is a downer. There's hope, Jaime says, - though "not unbattered hope" - that the characters in his songs will come through.

## 00:49:29 Review: Bob Dylan
![Tempest](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/26/8d/a9/268da9a7-731c-f80b-18eb-47ee0ffaee66/source/600x600bb.jpg "462006/544403750")

Jim and Greg wrap up the show with a review of {artist: Bob Dylan}'s 35th studio album {album: Tempest}. After fifty years of recordings, do they even have to introduce the inimitable {name: Robert Zimmerman}? {album: Tempest} is Bob's first album since 2009's widely panned {album: Christmas in the Heart}, and it continues the trend of him producing his own albums. So what do we get on {album: Tempest}? Dylan's voice, Greg notes, has always been unconventional, but fifty years has added considerable gravel and dirt to it. Nevertheless, it's the voice, {host: Greg} says, the really carries this album. It's perfect for the spur-of-the-moment, rough and rowdy honky-tonk feel Dylan is going for. Greg gives {album: Tempest} a {tag: Buy It}. {host: Jim} agrees. Dylan has always been interested in pop culture figures - he's sung about everyone from Rubin "Hurricane" Cater to Joe Gallo - so he wasn't too surprised to hear a Leonardo DiCaprio cameo on {album: Tempest}'s title track. What can he say? Bob's still got a sense of humor. Tempest gets a double {tag: Buy It}.
