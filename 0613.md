# Show 613: Melvins & Billy Bragg on Skiffle

![Melvins](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2017/melvins_web.jpg)

The {artist: Melvins} were an inspiration to the {era: '90s} {genre: alternative} explosion, but the band's unclassifiable sound and uncommercial stance set them apart. In a frank discussion with {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}, the Melvins reflect on their career and bust myths about the {genre: grunge} scene. Plus, singer-songwriter {artist: Billy Bragg} makes the case for the {era: 1950s} {genre: skiffle} craze as the origin of guitar rock and punk sensibilities in the {place: UK}.

## 00:01:45 Interview: Billy Bragg
![Roots, Radicals and Rockers](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/613/2X0.jpg)
In the {era: 1950s}, a surprising, short-lived musical craze swept across the {place: UK}: {genre: skiffle}, a raw version of African-American {genre: blues} and {genre: folk} performed by white British youth. F{genre: [f]olk-punk} singer-songwriter {artist: Billy Bragg} has written about skiffle in his new book [*Roots, Radicals and Rockers*](https://www.faber.co.uk/9780571327744-roots-radicals-and-rockers.html). This week, he sits down with producer {name: Evan Chung} to make the case for skiffle as the origin of English guitar pop and the first sign of the {tag: DIY} sensibility of {genre: punk}.

Skiffle emerged out of the {genre: trad jazz} scene – an early {genre: New Orleans jazz} revivalist movement in the UK. In the middle of their sets, the trad jazz musicians would put down their horns and pick up acoustic guitars, washboards, and upright basses to play the songs of {artist: Leadbelly}, {artist: Big Bill Broonzy}, and others. Skiffle hit the top of the pop charts in both the UK and the US when {artist: Lonnie Donegan} released his version of Leadbelly's "{track: Rock Island Line}." Bragg argues that this was a revolutionary moment that taught British youth that anyone could play the guitar – and led to skyrocketing guitar sales. As a result, members of {artist: The Beatles}, {artist: The Who}, {artist: Led Zeppelin}, {artist: Van Morrison}, {artist: David Bowie}, and even {artist: ABBA} got their start in DIY skiffle groups. According to Bragg, if you want to understand everything that came after in the UK – from the {era: British Invasion} to the {genre: English folk revival} to {genre: R&B} to punk – you have to look at the impact that skiffle had on the emerging British teenage culture.

## 00:25:40 Interview: Melvins

The {artist: Melvins} are hailed as progenitors of {genre: sludge metal}, key influences on the {place: Seattle} {genre: grunge} scene, and {genre: avant-garde} pranksters – but their music has always been virtually unclassifiable. That's certainly the case on their new double-album {album: A Walk With Love & Death}, which veers from heavy rockers to pop songs to ambient film scores. The Melvins join {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} in the studio to talk about the new record and their long career, dating back to their 1984 formation in {place: Washington}.

Guitarist/vocalist {name: Buzz Osborne} (aka {name: King Buzzo}) and drummer {name: Dale Crover} form the core of the Melvins, alongside a rotating bassist slot that's currently filled by {name: Steve McDonald} of {artist: Redd Kross} and {artist: OFF!}. They discuss their ill-fated major label stint in the {genre: 1990s}, the importance of playing the music that you want to play, and how they manage to survive as a band for over thirty years. They also dispel myths about {artist: Nirvana} (of which Crover was an early member) and the rest of the storied Seattle scene.
