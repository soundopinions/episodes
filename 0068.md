## 00:01:45 Review: Modest Mouse

![We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/68/2X0.jpg)

This show is an all-reviews blowout starting with the new release from {place : Washington} state {genre : indie} rockers {artist : Modest Mouse}. {album : We Were Dead Before The Ship Even Sank} is one of the most highly anticipated records of the season. Modest Mouse's underground fan base has emerged into the mainstream in the past few years, despite lead singer and chief songwriter {name : Isaac Brock}'s status as a rather polarizing figure. Jim recommends fans check out {name : Alan Goldsher}'s profile of Brock, Modest Mouse: A Pretty Good Read. Now, the band is joined by former {artist : Smiths}' guitarist {name : Johnny Marr}. {name : James Mercer}, lead singer of {artist : The Shins}, also provides backing vocals on a number of tracks. {host : Greg} thinks that {name : Isaac Brock} is doing what he does best on this album: combining quirky vocals and rhythms with a traditional {genre : pop} sensibility. He describes it as a very well-crafted record that isn't over-thought or overproduced and gives {album : We Were Dead Before The Ship Even Sank} a {tag : Buy It}. {host : Jim} was also impressed, describing the album as "brilliant." He thinks Brock deals in gloom and doom better than his peers and urges everyone to {tag : Buy It}.



## 00:11:25 Review: Antibalas

![Security](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/68/J10.jpg)

{artist : Antibalas}, formerly {artist : Antibalas Afrobeat Orchestra}, also has a new album out entitled {album : Security}. The {place : Brooklyn}-based band, who often plays in the same musical circles as {artist : TV on the Radio}, modeled itself after {name : Fela Kuti}'s {artist : Africa 70} band. {host : Greg} describes them as a true musical collective, and really enjoyed the fiery, polyrhythmic first half of the record. He thinks the second half is a little too subdued, and too controlled however, and can only give {album : Security} a {tag : Burn It}. {host : Jim} blames that level of control and "sterility" on producer {name : John McEntire}, of {artist : Tortoise}. He calls {album : Security} the coolest album that McIntyre has produced to date, but wishes it was a little more accessible, and a little less "skronky." He also gives it a {tag : Burn It}.



## 00:21:50 Review: Ted Leo and the Pharmacists

![Living With the Living](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/68/10E0.jpg)

Next up is a review of {album : Living With the Living} by {artist : Ted Leo and the Pharmacists}. This is the band's fifth album, but first to be released by {label : Touch and Go Records}. {host : Greg} thinks Leo is full of energy and enthusiasm, but explains that the singer/songwriter wears his musical influences on his sleeve. It's not difficult to hear the reference points of {artist : The Clash}, {artist : The Kinks} and {artist : The Jam}. {host : Jim} agrees, and explains that where the music falls short is when it goes the {genre : reggae} route. He doesn't think Leo and the band are very good at that style, but adds that {artist : The Clash} weren't that great at it either. Neither Jim nor Greg can recommend {album : Living With the Living} as a whole, but both critics say that {name : [Ted] Leo} and the band give a great live show. The album gets two {tag : Burn It}s.



## 00:28:46 Review: Low

![Drums and Guns (Bonus Track Version)](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/68/1BY0.jpg)

{album : Drums and Guns} is the new album from {artist : Low}, the {place : Duluth}, MN "{genre : slowcore}" band comprised of married couple {name : Alan Sparhawk} and {name : Mimi Parker} and {name : Matt Livingston}. The band recorded this album with producer {name : Dave Fridmann}, and the result is a bit of a departure. {host : Jim} notes that they've gone in a more {genre : electronic} direction, but thinks that the traditional {artist : Low} sound emerges after a few listens. He appreciates their experimentation, but because of a few misses, he must give the record a {tag : Burn It}. {host : Greg} was also put-off by the {genre : electronic} elements at first. But, like his fellow critic, he grew to appreciate and understand the album more after additional listens. Greg thinks the band did a great job of juxtaposing the noisy sound with the evocative lyrics. He gives {album : Drums and Guns} a {tag : Buy It}, but warns listeners to proceed with caution.



## 00:38:59 Review: Air

![Pocket Symphony](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/68/1SZ0.jpg)

The French {genre : electronic} duo {artist : Air} gets the next review. {name : Jean-Benoît Dunckel} and {name : Nicolas Godin} got notice stateside with albums like {album : Moon Safari} and appearances on the {album : Virgin Suicides} soundtrack. Now they are back with their fourth album, {album : Pocket Symphony}, which was produced by {name : Nigel Godrich}. {name : Jarvis Cocker} of {artist : Pulp} also makes an appearance. Greg thinks this release is more challenging than previous Air albums. He thinks the duo owes a great deal to {name : Phillip Glass}, but wishes they had introduced more of their light, {genre : pop} touches. For {host : Greg}, the men of Air are better as producers than as frontmen. He gives it a {tag : Trash It}. {host : Jim} calls Greg's analysis "cracked," and thinks the combination of ambient and pop is just perfect. He gives it a {tag : Buy It}.



## 00:46:32 Review: LCD Soundsystem

![Sound of Silver](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/68/25K0.jpg)

The final review of the show is of {artist : LCD Soundsystem}'s second release, {album : Sound of Silver}. LCD Soundsystem is helmed by {name : James Murphy}, the {label : DFA} producer many credit with defining the {place : New York}  {genre : club} sound. His merging of {genre : disco} and {genre : rock} with the debut LCD release was hugely successful among critics and music fans. Now Murphy and co. are back with a second release that veers more towards the disco than the rock. Fans of the first release might be disappointed initially; this album doesn't suck you in as fast. But, both {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} urge listeners to give it more than one try. Some of the songs are less accessible, but music fans (and frustrated critics) will appreciate the many inside jokes and reference points. {album : Sound of Silver} gets two {tag : Buy It}s.
