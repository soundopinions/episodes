## 00:01:49 Intro: Music News
It's been quite a week for {artist: Kanye West}. First an album [leak](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-kanye-west-yeezus-leak-20130614,0,3633049.story), then a baby [born](http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20710060,00.html), then an album release. But leave it to {artist: Jay-Z} to steal his thunder. His upcoming album, {album: Magna Carta Holy Grail}, won't be released until next month, but already it has sold over one million copies. The buyer? {tag: Samsung}. It will be giving {tag: Galaxy} users early access to the record, which was further promoted by this [ad](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B--ZARCwSIE) during an {tag: NBA} Final game. So if {tag: Billboard} were to recognize these Samsung sales, this would be the album to beat this year.

Another chart success this week: {artist: Black Sabbath}. Only this one was over four decades in the making. {name: Ozzy Osbourne} and his bandmates (less {name: Bill Ward}) debuted at #1 in both the U.S. and the U.K. The band only came close to this kind of success once before in 1971, but {album: 13} is a record-breaker.

## 00:04:15 Interview: Bryan Ferry
In his 4 decade long career {name: Bryan Ferry} formed the hugely influential band {artist: Roxy Music}, launched a successful solo career and became a style icon. Now, he's gone "{genre: jazz}." He joins {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} to talk about his new album {album: The Jazz Age}, which features reinterpretations of his songs in a {era: 1920's} {genre: big band} style. The album reunites Ferry with his Roxy co-founder {name: Brian Eno}, and despite previous creative differences, he says Eno pushed him to places he couldn't have gone on his own. Plus, Mr. Eno has even stated that the Roxy album released after he left is the band's best.

## 00:43:37 Review: Kanye West
![Yeezus](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/395/20P0.jpg)

For the past decade, {artist: Kanye West} has been the dominant force in {genre: hip-hop} - maybe even all of {genre: pop}, {host: Jim} says. And this week he came out with album no. six, {album: Yeezus}. West's last solo record, 2010's {album: My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy}, featured rich, radio-friendly production. On {album: Yeezus}, West has scaled back the lushness, if not the egomania. {host: Greg} says he hears everything from {place: Chicago} {genre: drill} music to industrial influences on this "brutally minimalist" record. Forget the radio audience - {album: Yeezus} is about Kanye and his anger. Thematically, that means lots of songs about freedom and control, Greg says, and West's perception that, for all his sucgicess, he is still being denied a place at the "big boy table" where his fellow business and media moguls sit. Potent stuff, but West's downfall, both {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} agree, is the sloppily racist and misogynistic lyrics he relies. On the basis of the music alone, Jim says, {album: Yeezus} is a Buy it, but the lyrics are trash. Yeezus gets a double {tag: Try It}.

## 00:52:04 DIJ: Greg
{name: Kanye [West]}'s mixed success on {album: Yeezus} gets {host: Greg} thinking about West's creative predecessors, and an artist who did anger-filled "industrial rap" even better. {artist: Saul Williams}' 2004 self-titled album merged aggressive, minimalist, production with anger-filled {genre: rap} in a way that got {genre: industrial} music heavyweights like {artist: NIN}'s {name: Trent Reznor} to pay attention. (Reznor later produced an album for Williams.) Greg plays "{track: List of Demands}" for his {tag: Desert Island Jukebox} as an example of what Yeezus could have been.
