## 00:35:00 Review: Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds

![ghosteen](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/724/1MC0.jpg)

{artist : Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds} are an {genre : art rock} band that just put out its 17th album, {album : Ghosteen}. After the tragedy of suddenly losing his 15-year-old son in 2015, Cave has been making music that's more contemplative and ambient, and Ghosteen is no exception. Initially, {host : Greg} thought the record was a dud, but really did a 180. He was incredibly moved by the album and how Cave is confronting loss and depression head-on with thoughtful music. {host : Jim} couldn't disagree more. He finds Cave's lyrics to be contrived and misses his more energetic, {genre : punk}-infused work.



## 00:42:50 Obit: Ginger Baker

Drummer and {artist : Cream} co-founder {artist : Ginger Baker} recently died at age 80. He was supremely talented and passionate specifically about African rhythmns and jazz. Greg chooses the track "{track : White Room}" by Cream to highlight just what a game-changing drummer he really was.



## 00:48:10 Obit: Kim Shattuck and Ed Ackerson

He died recently at age 54.
