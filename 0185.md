## 00:01:59 News: 06.12.09
It may have been many years since you last thought about {artist: The Lemonheads}, but they are making news this week. Lead singer {name: Evan Dando} is suing {tag: General Motors} over what he claims is the unauthorized use of his song "{track: It's a Shame About Ray}," in two commercials. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} don't hear an alarming similarity, but regardless, they wonder if this is really the best time to be suing GM? Check out the [ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uex6_ad7JXQ) for yourself.

{genre: Blues} singer {artist: Koko Taylor} died last week at the age of 80. Taylor was a longtime {place: Chicago} music icon, but as Greg explains, her influence was far-reaching. She was from the last generation of blues performers to have deep connections to the South. Initially Taylor didn't have a lot of confidence in her singing ability, but she developed one of the most bold voices and personas Jim and Greg have ever experienced. Through her partnership with Chicago's {label: Alligator Records}, Koko Taylor defined the Chicago blues sound and paved the way for female blues musicians. In tribute to her our hosts play "{track: I'd Rather Go Blind}."

## 00:08:29 Interview: Steve Earle
{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} are joined this week by musician {artist: Steve Earle}. {name: [Steve] Earle} was a guest on Sound Opinions last year. This time around it's not his own music he wants to talk about, but rather that of friend and mentor {artist: Townes Van Zandt}. Earle recently released an album of Townes Van Zandt songs called {album: Townes}. He believes that the Texan ranks up there with the best American songwriters. He wrote what he knew, and for the most part, that was himself. Earle blames alcohol for his mentor's demise, and hopes this album exposes that great catalog of songs to more people.

A lot of people have heard of Townes Van Zandt, but not as many have actually heard him. Following their discussion with Steve Earle, Jim and Greg highlight two songs voiced by Townes himself: "{track: Tecumseh Valley}," which illustrates the songwriter's tragic, but beautiful melodies, and "{track: Pancho and Lefty}," which reevaluates the myth of the {place: West}.

## 00:41:12 Review: The Black Eyed Peas
![The E.N.D. (The Energy Never Dies)](//static.soundopinions.org/assets/185/1WO0.jpg "360391/318390146")
{artist: The Black Eyed Peas} are hard to miss these days. After releasing a slew of hit albums and singles, they are back with {album: The E.N.D.} and its hit song "{track: Boom Boom Pow}." {host: Jim} was concerned that {name: Will.I.Am} had lost his touch after producing a number of failures for other artists. But the self-professed fan is happy to hear that the raps and beats are as silly as ever. He calls *The E.N.D.* a great summer album and gives it a {tag: Buy It}. {host: Greg} compares the songs on this record to other frothy hits like "{track: Who Let the Dogs Out}." He admits the {genre: bubblegum} formula is successful, but would never want to listen to an entire Black Eyed Peas album. He gives *The E.N.D.* a {tag: Trash It}.

## 00:48:03 Review: Phoenix
![Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix](//static.soundopinions.org/assets/185/2830.png "5500360/315002203")
Another new summer pop album is by the French band {artist: Phoenix}. Their fourth album is called {album: Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix}. That title and their song "{track: Lisztomania}" may give listeners the impression that this is a cerebral record. That impression would be wrong, however. For {host: Greg} this is a perfectly sequenced, filler-free {genre: pop} record that combines {genre: disco} with {genre: new wave}. For {host: Jim} it's an entrancing album from start to finish. Both hosts give the new Phoenix a {tag: Buy It}.
