# Show 406: The Rock Doctors do Kung Fu & Opinions on Nine Inch Nails and Sam Phillips

![rockdoctor](//static.soundopinions.org/images/rockdocs/rockdoctor.jpg)

{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} are the {tag: Rock Doctors}. They prescribe an epic workout playlist for a martial arts instructor in need. Later they review new albums by {artist: Nine Inch Nails} and {artist: Sam Phillips}.

 ## 00:01:48 News: 09-06-13
{artist: Katy Perry} wasn't the only thing roaring at {tag: MTV}'s recent {tag: Video Music Awards}. Digital sales for artists featured on the program have seen significant bumps. Among those feeling a lift were {artist: Lady Gaga}'s {album: Applause}, which saw a 20% rise and {artist: Bruno Mars}' {album: Gorilla}, which had a staggering 175% sales increase.

In other chart news the {tag: British Phonographic Industry} recently updated its sales award [rules](http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/retail/5680083/bpi-announces-auto-updating-gold-platinum-certification). So now, a little band called {artist: The Beatles} has finally gone platinum. The official count only began from 1994, though, so actual sales of hit Beatles albums like {album: Revolver} and {album: Help} can only be estimated.

By now everyone's heard {artist: Robin Thicke}'s {track: Blurred Lines}. But, have you heard 86-year old {place: Canadian} composer {artist: John Beckwith}'s {track: Blurred Lines}? Well, thousands of listeners have, though perhaps not intentionally. Beckwith's {era: 1994} [recording](http://www.musiccentre.ca/node/23269) for {tag: harpsichord} and {tag: violin} has gotten a huge boost in online streams ever since Thicke's song of the same name came out earlier this year. Blame it on {tag: Google}, but it seems hard to mistake Thicke for Beckwith's sounds inspired by the {place: Swedish} hardanger.

## 00:05:49 Rock Doctors: Kung-Fu
Yes it's time for a visit to the doctor. But don't fret, the {tag: Rock Doctors} are way fun. During this episode {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} treat a {tag: Kung Fu} master.  "Sifu"  {name: Richard Baron} runs [Kung Fu Power](http://kungfupower.com/) in {place: Highland Park, IL}. While it isn't traditional for martial artists to train to music, he finds it helps to inspire his students. But, he admits the playlist is getting a bit stale. So he turns to Drs. Kot and DeRogatis for a prescription for new music.

Dr. DeRogatis recommends an album by {artist: Thundercat}. It's the project of Bassist/songwriter/vocalist {name: Stephen Bruner}, and {host: Jim} hopes Sifu Richard will enjoy its grooves. But, after a week of using the 2013 album {album: Apocalypse} in his classes, the diagnosis is not good. This medicine did not go down well, according to our patient. It was too discordant and lacked soul, he says.

Dr. Kot prescribed some {artist: Thin Lizzy}. He picked out the most "epic" and "awesome" songs from the band's 1975 and '76 albums {album: Fighting} and {album: Jailbreak}. Cheesy? Perhaps, but {host: Greg} vetted this with a friend of his who boxes. Sifu Richard says that some of the tracks will make it to his regular playlist, but he can't abide something like {track: The Boys Are Back In Town}.

So, the treatment had mixed results. But on the upside, Jim and Greg gained some epically awesome martial arts knowledge. Just check out [their training session](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-00P9oHF30&feature=youtu.be)!

## 00:35:00 Review: Nine Inch Nails
![Hesitation Marks](//static.soundopinions.org/assets/406/1MC0.jpg "107917/655150305")
Ever since he debuted {artist: Nine Inch Nails} in 1988, {name: Trent Reznor} has had a tortured relationship with his one-man-band. He's moved in and out of the major label system, [retired](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/trent-reznor-says-goodbye-to-nine-inch-nails-20090917), returned and done a number of [side projects](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2011/02/trent-reznor-on-the-social-network-score.html). He also made a memorable [visit](/show/186) to the Sound Opinions studios. Now, Nine Inch Nails is back with its 8th album called {album: Hesitation Marks}. A dark title, but an apt one, according to {host: Greg}. It feels like a hesitant, tentative album and one in which Reznor wasn't fully invested. It's his quietest Nine Inch Nails release, even going back to the masterful {album: Fragile} in 1999. But, there's a lot of filler. Greg says {tag: Burn It}. {host: Jim} is shocked that Greg isn't digging this groovy album full of a sonic palette unlike any other. He says {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:42:52 Review: Sam Phillips
![Push Any Button](//static.soundopinions.org/assets/406/1ZG0.jpg "523849/669216615")
If all you know about {artist: Sam Phillips} is that she used to be married to {name: T. Bone Burnett} and that she provided the delightful score to *Gilmore Girls*, you are missing out. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} point to her gorgeous songwriting, expert pop craft and skilled editing. [The Brill Building](http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/eras/C1109)-inspired songs on this latest release, {album: Push Any Button}, are concise and add up to only 29 minutes. Phillips always leaves you wanting more. Jim and Greg both say {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:48:18 DIJ: Greg
The {place: Australia}n band {artist: The Saints} has been ushering in our {tag: Desert Island Jukebox} segment for years. And this week, {host: Greg} wants to stay in that continent and add a song by {artist: The Go-Betweens}. The band's series of albums in the {era: '80s} were wonderful, but never made a big commercial impact. They reformed in {era: 2000} and had one of those rare successful second acts. And it's from that era that Greg culls his DIJ pick: "{track: Here Comes a City}" from {era: 2005}.
