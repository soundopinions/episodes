## 00:00:44 Review: Ratboys

![Ratboys The Window](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/929/1812.jpg)
{artist : Ratboys} are a {place : Chicago} group who have taken a big step up with their new album “{album : The Window}” thanks to production from former Death Cab For Cutie member Chris Walla. 

## 00:06:58 Review: Noname

![Noname Sundial](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/929/BM12.jpg)
{artist : Noname} gained acclaim as a contemporary of Chance The Rapper, but in recent years she has viewed the music industry with suspicion. “{album : Sundial}” is her third album and before it was even released a guest verse on it was stirring up controversy.
