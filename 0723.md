Plus, Jim and Greg review {album : Ode To Joy}, the latest album from {genre : alt-rock} band {artist : Wilco}.



## 00:01:21 Review: Wilco

![Wilco Ode To Joy](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/723/290.jpg)

For their 11th studio album, {artist : Wilco} somewhat ironically invoke the fourth movement of {artist : Beethoven}'s Ninth Symphony, {album : Ode To Joy}. Greg doesn't find many expressions of joy on this record, pointing out songwriter {name : Jeff Tweedy}'s tendency to worry and externalize his feelings. With most of the songs built around acoustic guitar and plodding drums, there are few moments that break through the murky anxiety, mostly {name : Nels Cline} guitar solos. {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} agree this record is unlikely to garner many new fans for Wilco, but may satisfy longtime fans who are invested in settling into this specific mood.

This week {host : Jim} is less concerned about what he's listening to on the desert island, and more concerned that the island itself may soon be underwater!
