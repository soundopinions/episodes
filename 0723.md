From {artist: Sister Sledge} to {artist: The Cowsills}, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} share some of the great {tag: Family Bands} that made it work. Plus, Jim and Greg review {album: Ode To Joy}, the latest album from {genre: alt-rock} band {artist: Wilco}.

## 00:01:21 Review: Wilco
![Wilco Ode To Joy](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/723/290.jpg)
For their 11th studio album, {artist: Wilco} somewhat ironically invoke the fourth movement of {artist: Beethoven}'s Ninth Symphony, {album: Ode To Joy}. Greg doesn't find many expressions of joy on this record, pointing out songwriter {name: Jeff Tweedy}'s tendency to worry and externalize his feelings. With most of the songs built around acoustic guitar and plodding drums, there are few moments that break through the murky anxiety, mostly {name: Nels Cline} guitar solos. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} agree this record is unlikely to garner many new fans for Wilco, but may satisfy longtime fans who are invested in settling into this specific mood.

This week {host: Jim} is less concerned about what he's listening to on the desert island, and more concerned that the island itself may soon be underwater! He's chosen {artist: John Mollusk}'s "{track: Greta Thunberg sings Swedish Death Metal}," an adaptation of the climate activist's recent speech at the U.N.
