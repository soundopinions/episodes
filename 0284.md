## 00:01:53 News: 5.6.2011
Just a couple of years ago {tag: MySpace} was the place to check out {tag: new bands} and share them with friends. Now, their user base is shrinking while {tag: Facebook} is up to {tag: 500 million} users. So they are cashing in on the music scene and re-launching {tag: Music on Facebook}. It certainly lends itself to interacting with artists, but what about the listening? That remains to be seen.

{tag: Producer} {name: Phil Spector} was once known as the architect of the "{tag: Wall of Sound}." But from now on he'll be known as a {tag: convicted murderer}. A {place: California} appeals court rejected Spector's bid to overturn his murder conviction, saying it was permissible for prosecutors to call other women who said he had threatened them with guns in the past. He's now serving 19 to life in prison. His first trial ended in a hung jury.

## 00:05:20 Interview: Titus Andronicus
The members of {artist: Titus Andronicus} named their band after a {tag: Shakespeare} {tag: play}, their first album after a {tag: *Seinfeld*} reference, and the latest called {album: The Monitor} was influenced by the {tag: Civil War.} Needless to say this isn't your average {genre: punk} band. During their visit to {tag: Sound Opinions}, lead singer {name: Patrick Stickles} talks to {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} about his book smart lyrics and {place: New Jersey} roots. They also perform live. 

## 00:41:08 Review: The Beastie Boys
![Hot Sauce Committee Part Two](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2017/artworks-000006672528-senf1x-t500x500.jpg)
{artist: The Beastie Boys} started out as snotty punks fighting for their right to party. But now they have more in common with vets like {artist: R.E.M.} and {artist: U2}. Their 8th album, {album: Hot Sauce Committee Part Two}, was much delayed, in part, because of {name: Adam "MCA" Yauch}'s battle with cancer. But now it's here, and they haven't skipped a beat. The Beastie Boys are hardly boys anymore, but they make no attempt to be up to date. What they lack in edge they make up for in humor. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} give this a joyful {tag: Buy It} rating.

## 00:47:56 Review: The Feelies
![Here Before](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/04/25/e0/0425e03b-8ff1-418d-a672-ef03db6a11a9/source/600x600bb.jpg "261716484/428844206")
Going back to {place: New Jersey}, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} next review the new album by {artist: The Feelies}. As Greg explains, they don't rush anything. The band started in the late '{era: 70s} and has only produced five studio albums. But {album: Here Before} is worth the wait. Jim has a soft spot for The Feelies, but that actually makes him a tougher critic. He initially found this release a little sleepy, but grew to appreciate its small pleasures. Greg oddly recommends this new album as an introduction to new listeners. It's a survey of the high points of their career. Here Before gets a double {tag: Buy It}.
