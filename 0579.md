# Show 579: Mixtapes 2016 & Musical In Memoriam

![Mixtapes 2016](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2016/mixtape2016_web.jpg)

Sound Opinions closes out 2016 with the year in song. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} present a {tag: mixtape} of tracks that helped define the past year. And they remember some of the many musicians who passed away in 2016.


## 00:01:45 Obit: In Memoriam
The deaths of important rock musicians has been a constant theme in 2016. This is partially a factor of demographics, as the first and second generation of rockers are reaching old age. But the monumental losses of artists like {artist: David Bowie}, {artist: Prince}, and {artist: Leonard Cohen} felt staggering. Even with all the coverage they've given this year, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} felt there were still more musical losses that deserved attention.

### Wayne Jackson
Trumpet player {name: Wayne Jackson} died in June at the age of 74. As part of the house band of {label: Stax Records} and as a member of {artist: The Mar-Keys} and {artist: The Memphis Horns}, he helped define the sound of {place: Memphis} {genre: soul}. Jackson played on an astounding number of iconic songs by artists like {artist: Otis Redding}, {artist: Wilson Pickett}, {artist: Aretha Franklin}, {artist: U2}, and {artist: Peter Gabriel}.

### Keith Emerson and Greg Lake
In 2016, we lost both {name: Keith Emerson} and {name: Greg Lake} of {artist: Emerson, Lake & Palmer}, one of the cornerstone bands of {genre: progressive rock}. Before forming that supergroup, Lake was lead vocalist and bassist on the first and possibly greatest of {genre: prog} albums, {album: In the Court of the Crimson King} by {artist: King Crimson}. Emerson started off as the flamboyant organist of {artist: The Nice} and later turned the {tag: Moog} synthesizer into an essential rock instrument.

### Prince Buster
Songwriter and producer {artist: Prince Buster} was at the ground floor of {genre: ska}, {genre: rocksteady}, and {genre: reggae}. He produced "{track: Oh Carolina}" by {artist: The Folkes Brothers} in 1960, sometimes credited as the first reggae song. He then gave us countless other classic {place: Jamaica}n hits like "{track: Madness}," "{track: One Step Beyond}," and "{track: Judge Dread}." Prince Buster died this year at 78 after leaving a permanent imprint on reggae.

### Richard Lyons
{name: Richard Lyons}, a founding member of the experimental {genre: plunderphonics} collective {artist: Negativland}, died at 57. This follows the deaths of two other members of the band, {name: Ian Allen} and {name: Don Joyce}, in 2015. Negativland was a groundbreaking band in the use of {tag: sound collage}, cutting up strange audio and reassembling it in fascinating ways. The group is most notorious for its 1991 {album: U2} EP, featuring a vulgar tape of {name: Casey Kasem} ranting about the Irish band while a rendition "{track: I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For}" plays underneath.


##  00:21:31 Feature: 2016 in Song
As is tradition, Sound Opinions closes out the year with a mixtape that sums up the year. Generally, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg }each dub a tape with their favorite tracks of the year. This time, Jim saw Greg's mix early and felt he couldn't compete. So this year's show is all Greg and the mixtape he titled: "{tag: How Many Times}". Greg says these are the songs that "speak to the moment we live in", songs that touch on the {tag: Black Lives Matter} movement and the desire to break away from societal ills which seem to repeat over and over.
