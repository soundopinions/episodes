## 00:48:32 Review: My Bloody Valentine
![MBV album art](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/376/28W0.jpg)
We highlighted {artist: My Bloody Valentine} in our {genre: Shoegaze} genre dissection a few weeks ago, and after 21 years of scattered promises, it seemed to be a pretty safe bet that a 3rd MBV album would never see the light of day. But then on February 2, 2013, {album: MBV} was quietly released on their website. Is it even possible for the band to escape from the long shadow of their legendary sophomore album {album: Loveless}? {host: Greg} says not quite. He thinks that the first few songs rehash Loveless' glory, but don't meet its standard. The second half shows the band moving into the future. He anxiously awaits that future, but in the meantime, {album: MBV } is a {tag: Burn It}. {host: Jim} thinks the band lost momentum during this two decade hiatus. And while it is no {album: Loveless}, {album: MBV }is much better than he feared it would be. He gives the record a {tag: Buy It}.
