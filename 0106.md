# Show 106: Tori Amos & Wu-Tang Clan Review
This week Jim and Greg welcome rock goddess Tori Amos to the show for an intimate conversation.

## 00:01:45 News: 12.07.07
In what is turning into a regular Sound Opinions segment: "The Recording Industry vs. The Consumer," Jim and Greg turn this week to a news item coming out of {place: Oregon}. Earlier this year the {tag: RIAA} filed a lawsuit accusing 17 unnamed suspected {tag: University of Oregon} students of illegally sharing music. The suspects are identified only by an Internet address, and industry lawyers have demanded that the university identify them. Previously when the RIAA has done this, universities cooperated. But the University of Oregon's response has been quite remarkable. UO officials are refusing to identify the students without an investigation, saying that this would compromise their privacy and property rights. Oregon's Attorney General has backed the school and is accusing the RIAA of bullying. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} speak to {name: Tony Green}, a reporter at the Oregonian, about what is fast becoming a contentious battle.

While they may not be effective, the record industry lawsuits are an attempt to maintain ground in an ever-changing landscape. The next two stories speak to this music industry flux. {label: Universal}, the top music label, has ordered its artists to take full tracks off of their {tag: MySpace} pages. While MySpace was once viewed as a great promotional tool, it's now been added to the list of digital distribution enemies. Therefore, commercial successes like {artist: Colbie Caillat} are having to remove content from their sites and explain the issue to hungry fans. This move might have been a response to losses Universal experienced last quarter. They're also laying off a number of top and mid-level executives, and {tag: Vivendi}, the company that owns the label, has announced plans to acquire video game publisher {tag: Activision}. Activision produces Guitar Hero, the game that has proven to be more successful than any music release this year.

Another area the music industry is struggling with is commercial radio. With an increasing number of alternatives to radio including internet radio and the iPod, broadcast radio listenership has been gradually diminishing over the past few years. In an effort to maintain listeners, program directors are actually choosing to play fewer songs, more times. {tag: New York Times} reporter {name: Jeff Leeds} explains that commercial radio stations are oddly choosing to keep the listeners they've got, rather than get new ones. The most recent example of this strategy is the tremendous amount of airpla{artist: y given to {artist: OneRepublic}'s hit single "{track: Apologize}." The {name: Timbaland} produced t}rack recently broke the record for the most plays of a song on the nation's {genre: Top 40} stations in a single week. It was played almost 11,000 times in one single week and was heard by more than 70 million listeners.

## 00:21:45 Interview: Tori Amos
Veteran musician {artist: Tori Amos} stopped by the studio recently to talk to {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}. The {genre: singer/songwriter} was in town on a tour to promote her most recent album {album: American Doll Posse}, which both Jim and Greg agreed was a Buy It. {name: Tori [Amos]} is known for her strong {tag: feminist} views, as well as her accomplished {tag: piano} skills. But, as she explains, both those things weren't seen as positives early on in her career. After failing with her {genre: glam rock} project {artist: Y Kant Tori Read}, Tori decided to stay true to her heart and her musical roots. She approached record companies with her honest, political, piano-driven songs and was told that no one wanted the "girl at the piano." Luckily for us she stuck with that and has gone on to make and sell records.

For this album Tori decided to collaborate with some true rockers: drummer {name: Matt Chamberlain} and guitarist/producer {name: Mark Hawley} (aka Mac Alladin aka Mr. Tori Amos). Jim and Greg talk to Tori about why she chose to do such an earthy, almost Zeppelin-esque record. She explains that the sound partly came out of the content of the songs -- which express the anger and frustration Tori felt for and on behalf of American women after 2004's presidential election. She gave a lot of thought to the different roles American women play on a daily basis, and even adopted different female characters for different songs. If you get a chance to see Tori perform on this current tour, be ready for someone different to pop up.

## 00:48:18 Review: Wu-Tang Clan
![8-Bit Diagrams](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music7/v4/1a/a8/6c/1aa86c23-c05c-139a-fd2b-a3723554d4b5/source/600x600bb.jpg "338408298/1018951711")
It's been six years since pioneering {genre: hip hop} group {artist: Wu-Tang Clan} released an album, but now they're back with a new one called {album: 8 Diagrams}. Greg explains that you can't underestimate how groundbreaking and influential the group has been. They're known for their spooky, layered sound, which often includes {genre: sci-fi} and martial arts film clips, as well as their cryptic lyricism. There's not a whole lot of that on display on 8 Diagrams however. The group's central emcee, {artist: Ghostface Killah}, appears to have put more effort into his solo album, {album: The Big Doe Rehab}. He's only on three of the Wu-Tang tracks, and has openly criticized the album. The one member who is fully invested in Wu-Tang is producer {name: RZA}. Both men could have benefited from some collaboration. {host: Greg} gives Wu-Tang's album a {tag: Burn It}, and Ghostface's a Trash It. {host: Jim} appreciated the appearance of {artist: Red Hot Chili Peppers} guitarist {name: John Frusciante}, but he agrees with Greg 100%: Ghostface needs RZA, and RZA needs Ghostface.
