![Songs About the Devil](http://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2015/devilsongs_web.jpg)

With the spooky season creeping in, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} are beginning to feel a little diabolical. In honor of {tag: Halloween}, they share their favorite {tag: *Songs About the Devil*}. Then, a more angelic sound from singer/songwriter and {tag: harpist} {artist: Joanna Newsom}.


## 00:02:21 List: Devil Songs for Halloween
Whether or not you agree {genre: rock 'n' roll} is the {tag: devil}'s music, Lucifer sure is a major player in pop. From {artist: Robert Johnson} to "{track: Sympathy for the Devil}," beelzebub gets name dropped as much as the latest {genre: hip-hop} sensation. Here are {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}'s favorites to get you in the {tag: Halloween} mood:

## 00:49:10 Review: Joanna Newsom
![Divers](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music7/v4/14/38/44/143844a7-553a-38c8-5a29-2a20445b6b4f/JoannaNewsom_Divers_Mini.jpg/600x600bb-85.jpg "5565555/1027500473")
Performing on a huge orchestral {tag: harp}, {tag: singer/songwriter} {artist: Joanna Newsom} has stood out since she arrived on the scene in the early {era: 2000s}. {album: Divers} is the fourth album of her career, and the first since the 2010 {tag: triple album} {album: Have One On Me}. {host: Greg} has always been intrigued by Newsom's work, viewing her as a complete original. But although he admired the musicianship on *Have One On Me*, he found it an exhausting listen. *Divers*, by contrast, is relatively accessible. She still peppers in obscure literary references, but lyrically she is much more direct in creating an emotional connection for the listener. For Greg, this is the album that Newsom's skeptics should dive into – he gives it a {tag: Buy It}. {host: Jim}, however, is baffled. He scoffs at Newsom's faux-Shakespearean sentence constructions. He finds the album's lyrical concept, in which Newsom reflects on mortality after marrying comedian {name: Andy Samberg}, to be bloated. Jim is usually a big fan of pretentious {genre: prog rock}, but musically he thinks *Divers* is sodden and lacking hooks. And he's extremely irritated by Newsom's voice, hearing it as the affected voice of an eleven-year-old girl. According to Jim, there's nothing at all to like here, so *Divers* gets a {tag: Trash It}.
