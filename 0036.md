## 00:03:38 Special: MTV's Silver Anniversary 
MTV turns 25 this week. To celebrate (or perhaps mourn), Jim and Greg discuss the station's impact on the music industry. To kick off the dissection, Sound Opinions surveys the opinions of festivalgoers at Chicago's {tag: Pitchfork Music Festival}.

## Interview: Paul Levinson and Ken Tucker
Before weighing in on {tag: MTV}--the good, the bad and the ugly--our hosts turn to Professor {name: Paul Levinson}, chairman of the department of communications and media studies at {tag: Fordham University}, and {name: Ken Tucker}, editor at large for {tag: Entertainment Weekly} and pop music critic for {tag: Fresh Air}. We also hear from music fans at the {tag: Pitchfork Music Festival}, which was held in Chicago last week.

## 00:40:00 Review: White Whale
![WWI](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/36/1UO0.jpg)
The first album up for review this week is by {artist: White Whale}. This up-and-coming {genre: indie rock} group from Lawrence, {place: Kansas} first caught the attention of our hosts at this year's {tag: SXSW} Music Conference. Now they have released their debut album, {album: WWI}. Whether the title refers to the Great War, or a great record, is unclear. But, both Jim and Greg agree this album is worth a listen, though not necessarily a purchase. {host: Jim} loves the {genre: prog rock} approach, but can't go with a full Buy It. {host: Greg} agrees, explaining that he likes the music and finds White Whale intriguing, but isn't clear on the emotional subtext. He wonders where the "meat" is. Therefore, {album: WWI} gets two {tag: Burn It}s.

## 00:46:43 Review: Slayer
![Christ Illusion](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/36/25V0.jpg)
Shifting gears completely, Jim and Greg move on to {artist: Slayer}. {album: Christ Illusion} is their first new release since the one they released on 9/11, and the {genre: death metal} rockers are as angry as ever. {host: Greg} describes some of the [lyrics](http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/slayer/darknessofchrist.html) on the album as a "big middle digit" to all religions and all establishments of "the man." But, as our hosts explain, you don't listen to Slayer for political science lessons. They are a "great American rock band" because of what they do with guitar, bass and drums. {host: Jim} prefers them live, but both critics give {album: Christ Illusion} a {tag: Buy It} rating.

## 00:53:03 DIJ: Greg
Greg wraps up the show by picking a classic {tag: MTV} moment for the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}. He highlights "{track: Where Did You Sleep Last Night}," which {artist: Nirvana} performed live as part of MTV's {tag: Unplugged} series. If Greg had to choose a single performance by the band, it would be this one. The late {name: Kurt Cobain} pours his heart and soul into it, and the band's backing is incredibly empathetic. Of course, Cobain did not pen this tune. It was originally recorded as "{track: In the Pines}" in the {era: late 1930s}, and [Jim and Greg discussed its evolution](/show/12/) as part of a conversation with cyberlaw and free culture guru {name: Lawrence Lessig}.
