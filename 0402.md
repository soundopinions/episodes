## 00:01:49 News: 08.09.2013
The {tag: Federal Justice department} is showing a new interest in the iTunes store (and no, it's not because the DOJ is downloading {track: "Blurred Lines"}). Following a case last month that found {tag: Apple} guilty of e-book price-fixing, the Feds announced they would be seeking oversight of the {tag: iTunes} stores operations. What effect that oversight might have on music prices remains to be seen.

## 00:04:08 Interview: Lindsey Buckingham
Jim and Greg have admired {name: Lindsey Buckingham}'s solo albums for years, but during a stop on {artist: Fleetwood Mac}'s recent tour, the {tag: guitarist} was willing to indulge all of our burning questions about the band. Jim was out of town, so Greg took the reigns on this one and covered everything from his unique guitar style, to the {artist: Buckingham/Nicks} years to the effects of all that {era: '70s} drug excess. Lindsey reveals that in today's music environment, the band would've never lasted and credits the label with letting them tweak and reconfigure before hitting it big. He also talks about his ability to compartmentalize his relationship with {name: Stevie Nicks} and the work. {album: Rumours} is either the mark of insanity or courage! Lindsey also agrees with Greg that {album: Tusk} is the stepchild of the band's catalog, and you can either fault or credit him for that. And on the Stevie front...you'd think their dynamic would've flatlined by now, but he admits that although married with children, he's still writing songs about her!


## 00:48:45 DIJ: Jim
Jim celebrates pioneering rock critic {name: Mick Farren} with his DIJ pick this week. Farren passed away recently at age 69 in true rock 'n' roll fashion: onstage performing with his {genre: proto-punk} band {artist: The Deviants}. A star correspondent for Britain's NME, Farren wasn't content just writing about music; he also made it himself. {artist: The Deviants} merged {artist: Fugs}-style primitivism with the psychedelic weirdness of contemporaries like {artist: Hawkwind}. Jim plays "{track: Garbage}." from the band's {era: 1969} debut, {album: Ptooff!}, an album that would go on to inspire later generations of UK punks.
