![mixtapes](https://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2018/mixtapes.jpg)

Sound Opinions closes out 2018 with the year in song. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} present a {tag: mixtape} of tracks that tell the story of the the past year. And we remember some of the many musicians who passed away in 2018.


## 00:01:15 {tag: In Memoriam}
![in memorium](https://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2018/2018InMemorium.png)

We pay tribute to some of the musicians who died this year, but didn't get a proper tribute before. {host: Greg} starts with {artist: Clarence Fountain}, the leader of {artist: The Five Blind Boys of Alabama}, who died in June at the age of 88. He credits the Blind Boys' "house wrecking" style of {genre: gospel} as an unsung ingredient in early {genre: rock and roll} (along with {genre: country} and {genre: blues}). They were known for whipping their audiences into a frenzy of spiritual ecstasy, and {host: Greg} says you can hear that in the live recording of "{track: I Can See Everybody's Mother}" that was released by {place: Chicago}'s {label: Vee-Jay} label in the late {era: 1940s}.

Greg also memorializes {artist: Tony Joe White}, the "{genre: swamp rock}" singer-songwriter whose songs were hits for {artist: Elvis Presley}, {artist: Brook Benton} and {artist: Tina Turner}. He died in October at age 75. Greg says his way of depicting {place: Southern} life showed more nuance than most, especially when it came to race relations. Greg says the song "{track: Willie and Laura Mae Jones}" from 1969's {album: Black and White} album is a great example of this. 

{host: Jim} devotes his memorials to {tag: drummers} we lost this year, starting with {artist: Pantera}'s {name: Vinnie Paul}, who died in June at 54 years old. The {place: Texas} {genre: heavy metal} band was founded by Paul and his brother, "{name: Dimebag Darrell}" Abbott in 1981, but really broke through with the 1990 album {album: Cowboys From Hell}. Jim remembers spending a 12 hour day with the band for a story and seeing through their tough on-stage persona. 

The {artist: Cramps} lost their leader, {name: Lux Interior}, a few years ago, but their drummer {name: Nick Knox} died in June at 60 years old. Jim credits his understated, simple style with making the band's overall {genre: psychobilly} spectacle work. 

{name: D.J. Fontana} played drums for {artist: Elvis Presley} over 14 years and appears on more than 450 recordings with "The King." He also died in June of this year at 87 years old. In addition to his classic recordings with Elvis, Fontana also worked with {artist: Waylon Jennings}, {artist: Dolly Parton} and {artist: Steve Earle}. 

One of {artist: James Brown}'s drummers, {name: Jabo Starks}, died in May at 79 years old. Starks and drummer {name: Clyde Stubblefield} worked in tandem in Brown's band, with Starks holding down the backbeat and Stubblefield adding more {genre: funk}y flourishes. Before joining Brown's band, Starks played in Bobby Bland's {genre: blues} band. After working with Brown, he went on the play with {artist: BB King} and in a group with Stubblefield called the {artist: Funkmasters}. Jim plays "{track: Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine}" in tribute. 


## 00:17:37 List: Mixtapes

As 2018 comes to a close,  Jim and Greg tackle the timeless art of making a mixtape featuring their favorite songs from the past year. 

This year, {host:  Greg}'s {tag: mixtape} is called "Undone", because of the sense of "collective anxiety" that keeps cropping up in popular music. {host: Jim}'s {tag: mixtape} was inspired by {tag: gentrification}'s impact on artists and their communities, particularly in our home base of {tag: Chicago}.
