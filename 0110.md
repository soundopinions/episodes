## 00:03:40 News: 01.04.08
With 2008 ahead of us, it's time to look back at who reigned in the year that was. According to recent figures, it was {artist: The Police}. The recently reunited group had the top grossing tour of 2007 with $132 million. Also making the top 10: {artist: Genesis}, {artist: Van Halen} and {artist: Roger Waters}. While people like {artist: Justin Timberlake} and {artist: Christina Aguilera} also had successful touring years, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} were dismayed to see how dominant aging, nostalgia acts were. It doesn't bode well for the concert industry, especially when you see that overall sales were down almost 20%. Our hosts recommend concert promoters focus more on developing younger, more diverse acts if they want to improve the numbers for next year.

Next up {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} speak with {tag: Oscar}-winning director {name: Peter Bogdanovich}, whose new film {tag: Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers: Runnin' Down a Dream}, has been airing on the {tag: Sundance} Channel and is now available on DVD. Greg notes that Bogdanovich is a director who likes to cover big subjects and big men, like {name: Orson Welles} and {name: John Ford}. And the filmmaker agrees that Tom Petty fits into that mold. He describes him as a truly "American" artist, and one that warrants a four-hour film.

## 00:21:45 Interview: The Fiery Furnaces
This week Jim and Greg also speak with {name: Eleanor [Friedberger]} and {name: Matthew Friedberger} of {artist: The Fiery Furnaces}. The {place: Oak Park}, IL natives formed their duo in {place: Brooklyn} in {era: 2002}. Their latest album, {album: Widow City}, is a favorite of both Jim and Greg's. It was an opportunity for Eleanor and Matt to indulge themselves in their {era: 1970s} upbringing. They recorded the album in a more traditional way, and used artifacts of the era like a Ouiga Board and vintage House and Garden magazines as inspiration. You can hear the classic rock influence on the tracks "{track: Widow City}," "{track: Ex-Guru}," and "{track: Japanese Slippers}."

## 00:45:35 Review: Lupe Fiasco
![Lupe Fiasco's the Cool](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/7f/30/1a/7f301a97-e7b6-8888-4668-7e3fe1a9495b/source/600x600bb.jpg "2851441/269747242")
Rapper {artist: Lupe Fiasco} has a new record out called {album: The Cool}. The {place: Chicago} native, and recent Letterman guest, got attention with his 2006 debut album {album: Food and Liquor}. With this second record, the self-professed nerd has taken a turn for the dark. His music is reflecting the serious subjects that have always been apparent in his lyrics. {host: Greg} admits that at times Fiasco borders on preachy, but he was impressed by the complexity of {album: The Cool} and gives it a {tag: Buy It}. {host: Jim} was a little lost by some of the lyrics, but finds the music incredibly inventive. He thinks people who deny that {genre: rap} is music should listen to this and also gives the record a Buy It.
