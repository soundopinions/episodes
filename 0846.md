# Show 846: Debating KISS, Opinions on Amber Mark & RIP Sam Lay

This week, hosts Jim DeRogatis and Greg Kot talk to journalist, professor and author Sam Weller about the age-old question: is KISS good? While neither of the hosts are too fond, they hear from Sam about the merits of the almost 50-year-old band and their imprint on the history of rock and roll music. Join our Facebook Group: https://bit.ly/3sivr9TBecome a member on Patreon: https://bit.ly/3slWZvcSign up for our newsletter: https://bit.ly/3eEvRnGMake a donation via PayPal: https://bit.ly/3dmt9lURecord a Voice Memo: https://bit.ly/2RyD5Ah Featured Songs:KISS, "Rock and Roll All Nite [Live]," Alive!, Casablanca, 1975Amber Mark, "Most Men," Three Dimensions Deep, PMR, 2022Amber Mark, "What It Is," Three Dimensions Deep, PMR, 2022Amber Mark, "Darkside," Three Dimensions Deep, PMR, 2022KISS, "Detroit Rock City," Destroyer, Casablanca, 1976Wicked Lester, "She," The Box Set, Mercury, 2001KISS, "Beth," Destroyer, Casablanca, 1976KISS, "I Was Made for Lovin' You," Dynasty, Casablanca, 1979KISS, "Strutter," Kiss, Casablanca, 1974KISS, "Creatures of the Night," Creatures of the Night, Casablanca, 1982KISS, "Forever," Hot in the Shade, Mercury, 1989KISS, "Black Diamond," Kiss, Casablanca, 1974The Paul Butterfield Blues Band, "I Got My Mojo Working," The Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Elektra, 1965Muddy Waters, "Long Distance Call (feat.
