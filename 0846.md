# Show 846: Debating KISS, Opinions on Amber Mark & RIP Sam Lay

![alive](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2022/kiss-alive.jpeg)

This week, hosts Jim DeRogatis and Greg Kot talk about the age-old question: is KISS good? While neither of the hosts are too fond, they hear about the merits of the almost 50-year-old band and their imprint on the history of rock and roll music.

## 00:00:50 Review: Amber Mark

![Amber Mark Three Dimensions Deep](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/846/1E3.jpg)

Jim and Greg review {album : Three Dimensions Deep}, the debut album from {artist : Amber Mark}. They compare her favorably to {artist : Prince}, but point out a few cringey lyrics.

The hosts have a lighthearted debate about the longform essay, [“A KISS ARMY LOYALIST ON HOW KISS TRANSFORMED HIS LIFE AND HOW THE BAND SHOULD END IT ALL.”](https://www.popmatters.com/kiss-should-end-it-all#content) It's the first time {artist : KISS} has been featured on Sound Opinions after more than twenty years on the air.



## 00:43:58 Feature: Obit: Sam Lay

![sam lay](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2022/sam.jpeg)

{artist : Sam Lay} was best known as {artist : Muddy Waters}'s long-time drummer, but Greg points out he had a zelig-like career. He popped up in unlikely places like backing {artist : Bob Dylan} when he went electric at the {tag : Newport Folk Festival} and giving a young {artist : Iggy Pop} on-the-job training as a drummer before he formed {artist : The Stooges}. Lay died January 29 at age 86.
