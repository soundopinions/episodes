# Show 82: Chuck D, Don Imus Controversy, & White Stripes Review
Ever since Don Imus uttered those controversial words on his radio show, hip hop has been feeling the heat. To make sense of recent debates about the genre, Jim and Greg will talk with rapper Chuck D and a panel of hip hop insiders about language, race, gender, and of course, music.

## 00:01:45 Review: Kelly Clarkson
![My December](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/82/2X0.jpg)
On June 14, {tag: Live Nation}, or the concert promoters formerly known as Clear Channel canceled {tag: American Idol} winner {artist: Kelly Clarkson}'s first nationwide arena tour due to "lackluster ticket sales." This event, combined with the firing of her manager and the anticipation of the release of her third album {album: My December} has made for a dramatic couple of weeks for the singer. {name: Clive Davis}, the music mogul responsible for signing a ton of hit acts ranging from {artist: Whitney Houston} to {artist: Barry Manilow} to the {artist: Notorious B.I.G.}, has been overseeing the careers of Clarkson and all the Idol products thus far. But, much to the chagrin of Davis and her label {label: RCA}, Clarkson took {album: My December} as an opportunity to do her own songwriting and drift away from the guaranteed success of hit-makers like "{track: Since You've Been Gone}" scribe {name: Max Martin}. Jim and Greg commentate ringside for the blow by blow between America's first {genre: pop} princess and the pop recording legend. Listening to the album, Greg cannot understand the controversy surrounding the album's pop potential, finding it reminiscent of a post-{name: Dave Coulier} {artist: Alanis Morrisette}. {host: Jim}, on the other hand, thanks Clive Davis for trying to spare us the torment of this record. He thinks Clarkson is "at the level of a sub-par Midwestern bar band." {host: Greg} gives it a {tag: Burn It}, and Jim gives it a triple {tag: Trash It}.

## 00:10:41 Interview: Chuck D
In the wake of {name: Don Imus}' offensive comments about the Rutgers women's basketball team a couple of months ago, there's been a lot of discussion about language, race and sexism that has spilled over to the hip hop realm. Black leaders such as {name: Oprah Winfrey} and {name: Al Sharpton} have been questioning the use of certain words and imagery in the {genre: hip hop} lexicon, but perhaps the most significant statement was made by one of the architects of the music genre, {name: Russell Simmons}. The {label: Def Jam Recordings} founder and leader of the {tag: Hip-Hop Summit Action Network} released a statement that recommended members of the recording and broadcast industry self-censor their use of the words "bitch," "ho" and the n-word.

{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} wanted to dedicate this segment of the show to asking the question: Do these words still have a place in hip hop? To get the answer they first invited on {artist: Public Enemy} rapper and radio personality {name: Chuck D} Chuck explains he was on tour oversees when the Imus controversy went down, and it reminded him of how "funny" language can be in America. Chuck says that he wishes people like Russell Simmons had approached long-standing members of the hip hop community and tapped into grassroots movements before crafting his statement, but he agrees that not all words should be accessible to everyone all the time. Sometimes an artist does need to use strong language, but commerce shouldn't be built around it. And, because they craft words for a living, he expects that rappers in particular should be able to be more creative with language and not rely on the same set of words.

## 00:21:45 Interview: Mark Anthony Neal and Joan Morgan
Next Jim and Greg welcome {name: Mark Anthony Neal}, a professor of Black Popular Culture at {tag: Duke University} and author of {tag: New Black Man: Rethinking Black Masculinity}, and {name: Joan Morgan}, a writer and critic who recently left her post as Executive Editor of {tag: Essence Magazine}. Joan and Mark have been debating the merits and demerits of hip hop since they grew up as friends and neighbors in "Boogie Down {place: Bronx}." And Joan was one of the first music critics to examine the dichotomy of hip hop fandom and feminism in her 1990 {tag: Village Voice} review of {artist: Ice Cube}'s first classic album {album: AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted}. Greg asks Joan what she makes of {tag: misogyny} in modern hip hop. She explains that it was always there, but the level of it has changed. That concept of women has consumed commercial {genre: rap} music, so listeners don't hear a lot of balance in perspective and tone. She also explains that something like the Ice Cube album is actually easier to wrestle with because it's a brilliant album. Joan and Mark explain that labels are as complicit as artists in perpetuating a certain level of misogyny since they are the ones actually limiting the range of what you hear in hip hop.

Greg wonders if perhaps the consumer has already begun to speak out. Last year's top hip hop act, {artist: T.I.}, sold 1.7 million copies of his album {album: King}. Those aren't paltry figures to be sure, but they are definitely much smaller than what we've seen from star rappers in years past. Mark sees less revenue and less investment in major-label hip hop as a good thing; it's an opportunity for fresher sounds to come into the marketplace. Jim likens the trend to the development of {genre: indie rock} in the {era: '80s}. That market was also glutted with big name acts like {artist: Poison} and {artist: Mötley Crüe}, leaving music fans to seek out underground rock from bands like {artist: Hüsker Dü} and {artist: The Minutemen}. Perhaps next we'll enter into an era of {genre: indie hip hop}.

When asked about the effectiveness of banning certain words in hip hop music, Joan first expresses disappointment in what came out of Simmons and the Hip Hop Summit Action Network's meetings. Without doubting Simmons' sincerity, she calls the resulting call to action anemic at best and disingenuous at worst. Mark also grates against people, especially members of the "old guard," making proclamations about culture or language. This kind of criticism is compounded by the fact that critics of rap music often don't understand aesthetics. Mark's specific example is the hit hip hop single "{track: In Da Club}." People that take issue with the shallow nature of {artist: 50 Cent}'s lyrics may be failing to hear what makes a song like that so popular -- the production and the beats. Mark furthers that rulings against specific words don't take into consideration that some rappers can make really complex, compelling statements using racial or sexist epithets. Joan adds that you can also say some really sexist, racist and homophobic things without using any "bad words" at all.

## 00:44:31 Review: The White Stripes
![Icky Thump](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/82/2270.jpg)
Jim and Greg spend the last leg of the show discussing the new album from {place: Detroit} natives Meg and Jack White. {album: Icky Thump} is {artist: The White Stripes}' sixth studio effort in nearly ten years. Jim and Greg trace the duo's trajectory from their 1999 self-titled debut, to most recently, their 2005 commercial success and sonic departure, {album: Get Behind Me Satan}. {album: Icky Thump} continues this development, demonstrating how one of the biggest {genre: rock} acts in the world are truly junk collectors. You hear them flirting with {genre: mariachi} and {genre: flamenco} music, referencing {genre: Scottish folk} songs, and even covering {genre: traditional pop} singer {artist: Patti Page}. The album shows exactly how well-listened {name: Jack White} truly is. {host: Greg} calls {name: Meg White}, "terrific," standing behind the oft-discredited drummer. He doesn't think {album: Icky Thump} is a beginning-to-end perfect album, but believes it's the band's best work to date. He gives it a {tag: Buy It}. {host: Jim} goes even further calling this release "a masterpiece." That gives the White Stripes latest a double {tag: Buy It}.
