## Review: Stereolab
{artist : Stereolab} are back with their first new album in 15 years, “{album : Instant Holograms on Metal Film}.” It is only their fourth album since band member Mary Hansen died in a tragic accident in 2002. Still, the hosts say the group is as good as ever. 

## Review: Mclusky

{artist : Mclusky} are a British post-hardcore band that originally formed in the mid-1990s. Devoted fans of The Jesus Lizard, Mclusky recorded often with Steve Albini. Their new album, “{album : The World Is Still Here and So Are We}” is only their fourth full length album- and their first since 2004. The hosts think Mclusky is an undersung influence on new bands like Idles, Viagra Boys and Fontaines D.C.
