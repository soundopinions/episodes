## Review: {artist : Horsegirl}

{artist : Horsegirl} formed in Chicago as high school students and Girls Rock Camp participants before signing with Matador and releasing their noisy debut {album : Versions of Modern Performance} in 2022. Now on their second album, {album : Phonetics On And On}, their sound is more hushed- evoking bands like The Feelies more than Sonic Youth.

Ahmir “{artist : Questlove}” Thompson is back with his follow-up documentary film after winning an Oscar for his debut, “Summer of Soul.” “Sly Lives! (aka the burden of black genius)” is a triumph according to Jim and Greg.

{artist : Sly Stone}'s memoir was something no one in the music industry expected. So the fact it exists is notable, but Jim and Greg feel it falls short of its potential since it seems Sly doesn't remember many of the most notable episodes in his life.

In 2014 Family Stone members Jerry Martini and Cynthia Robinson spoke with Jim and Greg about their work with Sly Stone during his rise and fall in the music industry.
