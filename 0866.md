## 00:00:56 Review: Angel Olsen

![Angel Olsen Big Time](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/866/1K12.jpg)

On {artist : Angel Olsen}'s sixth album, {album : Big Time}, she leans into some hallmarks of country music, but it is not a “country album.” Jim and Greg agree this is one of her best efforts, showcasing her incredible voice which has a new confidence when compared to previous albums.



## 00:08:52 Interview: Yola

British singer-songwriter {artist : Yola} made an impression with her debut album in 2019, “Walk Through Fire,” breaking stereotypes as a black British country singer. Her follow-up, “{album : Stand For Myself},” breaks out of genre boundaries and is her best work to date according to Jim and Greg. They have a wide-ranging conversation with Yola that covers how the pandemic affected her writing process, differences between racism in the U.S. and the U.K., and her role as Sister Rosetta Tharpe in the new Baz Luhrmann “Elvis” film.
