## 00:38:07 Review: Phish

![Joy (Deluxe Version)](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/197/1RJ0.jpg)

For two decades the jam band {artist : Phish} has held a massive fan base. But, as {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} explain, most of these "Phish Heads" aren't all that interested in the band's studio records; it's all about the live experience. Now, after a five-year hiatus during which lead singer {name : Trey Anastasio} battled drug addiction, the band is back with a new record called {album : Joy}. As always, the goal is to create songs that are successful on record and stage. With the exception of a couple of tracks, Greg doesn't think the songwriting holds up. He can only give {album : Joy} a {tag : Try It}. Jim wishes the band would abandon its efforts at {genre : jazz} and {genre : funk}Â  {genre : fusion} and go back to its progressive roots. He loves the 13-minute suite "{track : Time Turns Elastic}," but gives the rest of the album a {tag : Try It}.



## 00:46:58 Review: Vivian Girls

![Everything Goes Wrong](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/197/26A0.jpg)

{artist : Vivian Girls} also have a new release called {album : Everything Goes Wrong}. The title might be referring to the year the band had following their successful self-titled debut. Not only did they lose their drummer, but guitarist/songwriter {name : Cassie Ramone} also went through a bad breakup. As {host : Greg} states, their pain is our pleasure. He loves this follow-up and hears a lot of musical growth. {host : Jim} agrees, adding that the Vivians' take on female sexuality is much needed in our culture. {album : Everything Goes Wrong} gets a double {tag : Buy It}.
