## 00:38:07 Review: Phish
![Joy (Deluxe Version)](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/0d/3e/39/0d3e3948-b53c-d9da-66b1-b975370eaeba/source/600x600bb.jpg "153159/328253366")

For two decades the jam band {artist: Phish} has held a massive fan base. But, as {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} explain, most of these "Phish Heads" aren't all that interested in the band's studio records; it's all about the live experience. Now, after a five-year hiatus during which lead singer {name: Trey Anastasio} battled drug addiction, the band is back with a new record called {album: Joy}. As always, the goal is to create songs that are successful on record and stage. With the exception of a couple of tracks, Greg doesn't think the songwriting holds up. He can only give {album: Joy} a {tag: Try It}. Jim wishes the band would abandon its efforts at {genre: jazz} and {genre: funk} {genre: fusion} and go back to its progressive roots. He loves the 13-minute suite "{track: Time Turns Elastic}," but gives the rest of the album a {tag: Try It}.

## 00:46:58 Review: Vivian Girls
![Everything Goes Wrong](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/20/97/7c/20977cc9-5ecb-2c36-62d3-f70c8e63864d/source/600x600bb.jpg "289447959/324964365")

{artist: Vivian Girls} also have a new release called {album: Everything Goes Wrong}. The title might be referring to the year the band had following their successful self-titled debut. Not only did they lose their drummer, but guitarist/songwriter {name: Cassie Ramone} also went through a bad breakup. As {host: Greg} states, their pain is our pleasure. He loves this follow-up and hears a lot of musical growth. {host: Jim} agrees, adding that the Vivians' take on female sexuality is much needed in our culture. {album: Everything Goes Wrong} gets a double {tag: Buy It}.
