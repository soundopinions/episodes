{tag : John Carpenter} is best known as the director of horror masterpieces like {tag : Halloween} and {track : They Live}, but his innovative film scores elevate the films to a whole other level. Carpenter explains to Jim and Greg that he initially started composing synthesizer-based scores for his movies as a cost-saving measure. He downplays his musical skill, but says he does enjoy performing his music in a group with his son and godson.
