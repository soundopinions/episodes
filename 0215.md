## 00:05:13 News: 1.08.2010
Sad news this week week: {place: Memphis} musician {name: Willie Mitchell} has died at the age of 81. Mitchell was a {tag: trumpeter}, {tag: arranger} and {tag: producer} for {label: Hi Records}.

They two even teamed up again in 2005 for the album {album: Everything's OK}. To honor the musician {host: Jim} and Greg play one of their favorite tracks—{artist: Ann Peeble}'s "{track: I Can't Stand the Rain}," as produced by Willie Mitchell.

## 00:10:22 Interview: Kid Sister
{place: Chicago} rapper {name: Melisa Young}, better known as {artist: Kid Sister}, joins {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} in the studio this week. She began to get notice after releasing her breakthrough hit "{track: Pro Nails}" in 2007, and since then has become a mainstay in the club and festival circuit. However, it wasn't until November {era: 2009} that she released her full-length debut {album: Ultraviolet}. Melisa explains to Jim and Greg that it just wasn't perfect, and she wouldn't release it until it was. Now the album is an up-tempo blend of hip hop, electronica and house, and features guest [appearances](http://hypem.com/track/988485/Kid+Sister+-+Daydreaming+Ft+Cee+Lo+) by {artist: Cee-Lo Green} and {artist: Kanye West} on a new version of "{track: Pro Nails}." But, Melisa assures Jim and Greg she hasn't gone Hollywood. She's still got plenty of energy and appears to be happier just jamming out at the gym.

## 00:39:57 Review: Vampire Weekend
![Contra (Bonus Track Version)](//static.soundopinions.org/assets/215/1UL0.jpg "259437105/340465551")
The first review of the new year goes to {artist: Vampire Weekend}. Their album {album: Contra} is the follow-up to their {era: 2008} debut—one that {host: Greg} explains had a backlash even before its release. The {place: Brooklyn} certainly seems to polarize. In fact, Jim absolutely hated the debut.  But do they deserve such passionate hatred or praise? With {album: Contra}, they are trying to be more ambitious musically. There are elements of reggae, dub and even autotune. But, Greg still [hears](http://leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com/turn_it_up/2010/01/album-review-vampire-weekend-contra.html) a perfectly nice pop band—nothing more, nothing less. He gives the record a {tag: Burn It}. {host: Jim} [admits](http://blogs.suntimes.com/derogatis/2010/01/vampire_weekend_contra_xl_1_st.html) Vampire Weekend has a terrific drummer and undeniable hooks, but he can't get past the preppy yacht schtick. He wishes they were more critical and thoughtful in their lyrics and gives {album: Contra} a {tag: Trash It}.

## 00:46:45 Review: Alicia Keys
![The Element of Freedom (Deluxe Version)](//static.soundopinions.org/assets/215/25X0.jpg "316069/1147810482")
{genre: Pop} and {genre: R&B} singer {artist: Alicia Keys} also has a new album out this week called {album: The Element of Freedom}.  This is the 4th record from one of the biggest artists of the last decade, and [according](http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/chi-sc-music-quarter-keys-1211dec15,0,6116849.story) to {host: Greg}, she's being more conservative and less gimmicky. The album is therefore more consistent, but lacks the rough edges you can hear in a song like "{track: Love is My Disease}." He wishes she'd let lose more and gives the record a {tag: Burn It} rating. {host: Jim} is [able](http://blogs.suntimes.com/derogatis/2010/01/alicia_keys_the_element_of_fre.html) to overlook Keys' horrible lyrics, but can't get over the hair metal production. He thinks these songs fit better in the hands of {artist: Jon Bon Jovi} and gives {album: The Element of Freedom} a {tag: Trash It}.
