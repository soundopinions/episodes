# Show 426: Bands of The Bermuda Triangle

## 00:02:33 News: 01.24.14 
Digitally-savvy {tag: Deadheads} rejoice! {name: Jerry Garcia}'s official website is getting an impressive makeover which includes a massive archive of 15,000 hours worth of {artist: Grateful Dead} material to listen to for free, some of them fan recordings. {host: Jim} notes that these bootlegs have been circulating around for a long time, usually traded in person. But now with this update, fans can swap in a virtual "Parking Lot." The website is so comprehensive that {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} think the only offerings missing are grilled cheese sandwiches and mind-altering substances.

Tweens across the country are raising their tiny fists to self-empowerment anthem "{track: Let It Go}" from {tag: Disney}'s latest animated feature, {tag: *Frozen*.} The single, sung by {artist: Demi Lovato}, is flying up the {tag: Billboard} charts with over a half million downloads sold. But, only six {host: radio} stations nationwide have reported playing the song on-air. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} say this isn't the first time an album or single has made it big without the help of radio. Just look at {artist: Beyonce}'s latest release or the {tag: *Les Misérables*} soundtrack. Both hosts take this as just another sign of the FM dial is loosing its hit making-or-breaking influence.

{artist: Ella Fitzgerald} is known for her {tag: perfect pitch}, something long thought to be a skill developed early in life by only a lucky few. But Professor {name: Takao Hensch} of {tag: Harvard University} says that he's got a pill that makes it possible for anyone to gain that skill, regardless of age. The pill is normally used to treat epilepsy by temporarily retiring the brain to a juvenile-like state, which just happens to be the perfect time to learn all kinds of things. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} smile at the idea of auto-tune going by the wayside. But, is taking a pill for perfect pitch like taking steroids in sports? Also, if every artist had perfect pitch, the world may never know another {artist: Bob Dylan} or {artist: Lauren Hill} whose voices brim with personality. Perfection is overrated, says Jim. 

## 00:09:10 List: Bands of the Bermunda Triangle

## 00:49:09 Review: Warpaint
![Warpaint](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d8/Warpaint_-_Warpaint_album.jpg/220px-Warpaint_-_Warpaint_album.jpg "305664605/725462668")
{place: Los Angeles} {genre: space pop} quartet {artist: Warpaint} is back with a self-titled sophomore record. Formed in 2004, Warpaint spent years refining its sound and lineup before dropping its debut LP, {album: *The Fool*}, in {era: 2010}. By that time, founding members {name: Theresa Wayman}, {name: Jenny Lee Lindberg}, and {name: Emily Kokal} had brought onboard gifted Aussie drummer {name: Stella Mozgawa}. {host: Jim} enjoyed {album: *The Fool*} and had high-hopes for the follow-up—but when he saw super-producers {name: Flood} and {name: Nigel Godrich} behind the board on this album, he prepared for bombast. What he found instead was subtle music that rewards close listening. It's a strong soundtrack for household chores and {tag: Valentine's Day} alike, and Jim would definitely {tag: Buy It}. {host: Greg} is impressed with how this band has evolved, with Mozgawa's drums perfecting the give-and-take between all four instruments. Although this record has fewer rock hooks than their debut, he salutes Warpaint for infusing {genre: ambient} music with unexpected harmonies and "shimmy." You might have to dig deep to find the groove, says Greg, but if you invest the time, {album: Warpaint} is a surefire Buy It.
