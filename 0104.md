## 00:01:45 News: 11.23.07
Two scientists out of the {tag: University of London} recently announced findings that file-sharing in {place: Canada} has no negative effect on CD sales. In fact, it increases sales. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} speak with one of the researchers, Dr. {name: Birgitte Andersen}, about the study and its implications for the music industry. Dr. Andersen explains if you just compare (illegal) downloaders with non-downloaders, the downloaders don't purchase any more or fewer CDs than those who purchase music traditionally. And if you just look at the purchasing patterns of downloaders, those who download a lot bought more music than those who downloaded a little. There's been quite a lot of discussion about the meaning of this study, but it seems the music industry needs to find something else to blame for its lack of sales.
