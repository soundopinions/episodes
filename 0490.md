# Show 490: Going Solo & Opinions on Modest Mouse

![goingsolo](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2015/goingsolo_web.jpg)

It's been 45 years since {artist : Paul McCartney} broke away from {artist : The Beatles} to release his first solo album. To mark the occasion, Jim and Greg talk about other artists' efforts toward {tag : Going Solo}. Later they review the latest from {album : Modest Mouse}.



## 00:02:07 Intro: Music News

{artist : Percy Sledge} died this week at the age of 74 from cancer. The {genre : soul} singer was most famous for his hit song "{tag : When a Man Loves a Woman}." The story goes that as a young man he was working in a hospital when a patient overheard him singing and suggested he record music for a living. His songs have been covered numerous times, most prominently by {artist : Michael Bolton}, which caused a resurgence of popularity for Sledge in the '{era : 90}s. He continued making music and performing up until his death.

It's no secret that {artist : Ringo Starr} is a great drummer but should he be in the {tag : Rock and Roll Hall of Fame} as a {tag : solo artist}? {artist : Paul McCartney} thought so and worked with {artist : Bruce Springsteen} and {artist : Dave Grohl} to get Starr inducted as a special candidate. Ringo received the "Musical Excellence Award" - only the fourth recipeint in HOF history.



## 00:08:32 List: Going Solo

{artist:Paul McCartney} released his first post-{artist : [The] Beatles} album 45 years ago this month, launching a commercially successful {tag : solo} career that is still going strong. Sometimes members of a famous band go out on their own and fall flat on their faces. But in this segment, {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} share examples of artists {tag : going solo} and living up to expectations.

## 00:49:08 Review: Modest Mouse

![Strangers to Ourselves](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/490/29W0.jpg)

After making fans wait 8 years, {artist : Modest Mouse} is back with {album : Strangers to Ourselves}. The {place : Washington} band graduated college rock and had a brief taste of big time success with "{track : Float On}." But, disappointingly for {host : Greg}, they haven't used this extended break to make any sonic shake-ups. It's more of the same - almost like lead singer {name : Isaac Brock} has been sleeping these past years and woke up just prior to recording. He says {tag : Trash It}. {host : Jim} wonders why all the shade, Greg?! True, Modest Mouse does one thing, but they do it really well. The album is admittedly a few tracks too long (especially the track "{track : Pistol}"), but Jim thinks the band really succeeds at giving listeners a lilting, wistful, psychedelic sound that also delivers pop hooks. He says {tag : Buy It}.
