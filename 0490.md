# Show 490: Going Solo & Opinions on Modest Mouse

![goingsolo](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2015/goingsolo_web.jpg)

It's been 45 years since {artist: Paul McCartney} broke away from {artist: The Beatles} to release his first solo album. To mark the occasion, Jim and Greg talk about other artists' efforts toward {tag: Going Solo}. Later they review the latest from {album: Modest Mouse}.

## 00:02:07 News: 04.17.15
{artist: Percy Sledge} died this week at the age of 74 from cancer. The {genre: soul} singer was most famous for his hit song "{tag: When a Man Loves a Woman}." The story goes that as a young man he was working in a hospital when a patient overheard him singing and suggested he record music for a living. His songs have been covered numerous times, most prominently by {artist: Michael Bolton}, which caused a resurgence of popularity for Sledge in the '{era: 90}s. He continued making music and performing up until his death.

It's no secret that {artist: Ringo Starr} is a great drummer but should he be in the {tag: Rock and Roll Hall of Fame} as a {tag: solo artist}? {artist: Paul McCartney} thought so and worked with {artist: Bruce Springsteen} and {artist: Dave Grohl} to get Starr inducted as a special candidate. Ringo received the "Musical Excellence Award" - only the fourth recipeint in HOF history.

## 00:49:08 Review: Modest Mouse
![Strangers to Ourselves](http://assets.rollingstone.com/assets/2015/media/188312/_original/1425920120/1035x1035-MI0003830238.jpg "467112/949625576")
After making fans wait 8 years, {artist: Modest Mouse} is back with {album: Strangers to Ourselves}. The {place: Washington} band graduated college rock and had a brief taste of big time success with "{track: Float On}." But, disappointingly for {host: Greg}, they haven't used this extended break to make any sonic shake-ups. It's more of the same - almost like lead singer {name: Isaac Brock} has been sleeping these past years and woke up just prior to recording. He says {tag: Trash It}. {host: Jim} wonders why all the shade, Greg?! True, Modest Mouse does one thing, but they do it really well. The album is admittedly a few tracks too long (especially the track "{track: Pistol}"), but Jim thinks the band really succeeds at giving listeners a lilting, wistful, psychedelic sound that also delivers pop hooks. He says {tag: Buy It}.
