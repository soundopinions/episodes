*...the Eternal Struggle... The Hits Pt. 2*

For his 2019 Holiday Spectacular, Andy Cirzan completes his look back on his first 30 years of making Christmas music mixes. The title is inspired by a clip of dialogue from a dubbed version of the Mexican film "Santa Claus." It covers a wide range of genres from there, concluding with the first appearance of South Korea's He-5 doing a psych-rock version of "Auld Lang Syne."

And, sorry to be a Scrooge, this year's mix isn't available for download. But please download and share the podcast which contains full tracks.
