# Show 923: RIP Sinéad O'Connor



## 00:00:00 Intro: Coming Soon

Hosts Jim DeRogatis and Greg Kot bid farewell to the late singer, songwriter and activist Sinéad O'Connor, who recently died at age 56. Jim and Greg are longtime fans of both O'Connor's music and her devotion to speaking truth to power, even when the world felt like it was against her. The hosts revisit their interview with documentarian Kathryn Ferguson about her 2022 film Nothing Compares, plus they share some of their favorite Sinéad tracks.
