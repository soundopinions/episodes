## 00:01:45 Special: Ask the Critics
To kick off the first show of the new year, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} answer some of your questions.

{name: Mark} from {name: Chicago} and {name: John} from {place: Lexington, SC} want to know how Jim and Greg choose reviews and how they listen to those albums? Jim explains that we first narrow 
down a list of albums that are either interesting or making news. Then it comes down to what would make a good mix for the show. So if the feature segment is all about {genre: soul}, we might like to get a little {genre: punk} at the end. Greg answers part two, and explains that he tries to listen to an album as many times as possible and, most importantly, in as many different scenarios as possible. He hears music very differently whether he is driving down {tag: Lake Shore Drive} in {place: Chicago} or doing dishes at home.

This leads to question #2. Nathan in {place: Chicago} is looking for suggestions on how to heighten the digital music experience. Can we do better than just {tag: headphones} in an {tag: iPod}? Jim and Greg admit they are not always seeking the most hi-fi experience, so they turn to {name: Bob Gendron}, copy editor for {tag: Music Direct} and contributor to the {tag: Chicago Tribune}. Bob recommends Nathan get a pair of {tag: Grado SR-60i} headphones. Priced at $79, they give nice bang for the buck. But if Nathan is a high roller who wants his mind blown, Bob refers him to the {tag: Audeze LCD-3}.

Chris from {place: Corvallis, OR} emailed interact@soundopinions.org for recommendations on songs to learn to play on {tag: ukulele}. All the uke players around Sound Opinions H.Q. say that {artist: Paul McCartney} is a great place to start; the simple pop melodies are perfect for the four-stringed instrument. Greg adds a vote for {artist: Weezer}. YouTube is filled with ukulele love.

## 00:10:19 Genre Dissection: Shoegaze
Today {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} dive into "{genre: Shoegaze}." In the late '{era: 80s} and early '{era: 90s}, this sound developed in the {place: U.K.} and was typified by lots of guitar, lots of atmosphere and lots of noise. But while the height of Shoegaze only lasted a few years, its influence looms large today. As Jim and Greg explain, the artists of this movement were students of rock history. They looked at the guitar as something more than a traditional blues instrument. Those hunks of wire and wood could act as a sound machine. You can trace a line from bands like {artist: The Velvet Underground} and {artist: Dinosaur Jr.} to key Shoegaze bands like {artist: My Bloody Valentine}, {artist: Lush}, {artist: Ride} and {artist: Slowdive}. And their desire to marry rock drive with otherworldly ambience is what carries the genre into the present moment. It's also important to note that while the term "shoegazer" began as derisive-musicians staring at their shoes are no fun to watch-seeing these acts live was really a special, albeit loud, experience.

## 00:49:12 Review: Big Boi
![Vicious Lies and Dangerous Rumors](//static.soundopinions.org/assets/371/2A00.jpg "130023951/580845949")

We may not have heard new {artist: Outkast} since 2006's {album: Idlewild}, but one-half of that groundbreaking {place: Atlanta} {genre: hip hop} duo has a new record out. {artist: Big Boi}'s first solo album, {album: Sir Lucious Leftfoot...The Son of Chico Dusty}, came out in 2010 to positive reviews. Now he's followed it up with {album: Vicious Lies & Dangerous Rumours}. How does the new record stack up? Well {host: Jim} calls it "hip-hop at its best." Big Boi's been playing the rock festival circuit and he's nothing if not ambitious with his collaborations on Vicious Lies. Everyone from indie band {artist: Wavves} to more traditional hip-hop guest {artist: Kid Cudi} makes an appearance on this record. For Jim, the songs succeed or fail on the strength of the guest, which makes this only a {tag: Try It} album. {host: Greg} agrees. Big Boi's solo records mostly remind him of how much he misses Outkast. Can't those two guys get back together already? {album: Vicious Lies & Dangerous Rumours} gets a double {tag: Try It}.
