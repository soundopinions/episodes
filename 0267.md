## 00:01:52 News: 01-07-2011 
After {artist: The Beatles} finally announced the band would put its catalog on {tag: iTunes}, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} noted that only a few major artists remained holdouts. One such musician is {artist: Kid Rock}, and according to a recent {tag: Billboard} article, this might be a smart move if your goal is making money. Kid Rock's recent release {album: Born Free} has sold over 612,000 copies, but reporter {name: Glenn Peoples} says that he would have only sold 294,000 had digital singles been available. So by forcing consumers to buy whole albums, Kid Rock may have made an additional $3 million.

Next, Jim and Greg play catch up on some big news that broke over the holidays. {genre: Rock & roll} experienced one of its greatest losses: {name: Don Van Vliet}, otherwise known as {artist: Captain Beefheart}. Jim remembers Beefheart and his band's off the wall performance on {tag: *Saturday Night Live*}. It illustrates what a unique performer he was. But, as Jim goes on, Beefheart wasn't just weird, he was an ambitious perfectionist – and one that influenced many and was imitated by none, according to Greg. To honor Captain Beefheart, Jim and Greg play "{track: Ella Guru}" from his {era: 1969} album {album: Trout Mask Replica}.

## 00:47:13 Review: Nicki Minaj
![Pink Friday (Deluxe Edition)](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/9b/4b/b1/9b4bb1fb-361a-a614-3d5c-8ec1f106baf9/source/600x600bb.jpg "278464538/443207964")
{artist: Nicki Minaj} has taken the {genre: rap} world by storm. Some are comparing her to {artist: Lady Gaga}, while others say {artist: Lil' Kim}. But neither do justice to Minaj's flair for role-playing and rhyme skills. {host: Jim} doesn't think all of the tracks on her debut {album: Pink Friday} are successful, but when she's on, she's on. He'd also add {artist: Missy Elliott} and {artist: Peter Gabriel} to the list of comparisons. Jim gives the record a {tag: Burn It} rating. {host: Greg} has been blown away by the rapper's cameos on other records, but the situation is reversed on *Pink Friday* – the guest stars outshine her. Despite the ruckus Minaj has caused in the rap world, Greg is let down. He gives *Pink Friday* a {tag: Trash It}.
