## 00:00:00 Review: Julien Baker and Torres

{artist : Julien Baker and Torres} are both accomplished artists in their solo careers, but the breakout success of Baker’s group Boygenius has put more attention on “{album : Send A Prayer My Way},” the duo’s debut album. Though Baker and Torres are more associated with the indie underground, this album aims squarely at mainstream country music.

Jenny Toomey and Kristin Thomson led the indie rock band {artist : Tsunami} throughout the ‘90s, but that’s far from their only contribution to the independent music scene. The label they founded, Simple Machines, helped artists get their music out in the world without being exploited. And the advocacy group they founded, The Future of Music Coalition, sought to make digital music distribution more fair for artists. The duo talk with hosts Jim DeRogatis and Greg Kot about their perspective on that work with the advantage of hindsight and getting the band back together and on the road.
