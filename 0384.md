## 00:01:49 News: 4.05.2013
{genre: Rock} lost two behind-the-scenes heavyweights last week: America's first rock critic {name: Paul Williams}, and record {tag: producer} {name: Phil Ramone}. Williams launched {tag: Crawdaddy!} magazine while still in college, beating {tag: Rolling Stone} to the rock-criticism game by a year. Never one to dwell on the rock's celebrity aspect, Williams found less commercial success than prot'eg'e {tag: Jann Wenner}, but his intellectual criticism was an inspiration for rock critics to come (Jim and Greg included).

Phil Ramone's contributions to classic records like Dylan's {album: Blood on the Tracks} and {artist: The Band}'s self-titled album made him a sought-after producer for over half a century. But Greg says it's his work with {artist: Paul Simon} that cements his reputation. Greg plays Simon's "{track: Gone at Last}" in remembrance of Ramone.

## 00:06:24 Interview: Emeli Sande
{artist: Emeli Sande} went from virtual unknown to performing at the 2012 Olympics closing ceremonies, and in between she penned songs for {artist: Leona Lewis }and even {artist: Susan Boyle}. She's also made it her personal mission to put the poetry back in {genre: pop} music. It's a mission that has caught on in the U.K. Emeli received a {tag: Brit Critics Choice Award} (previously won by {artist: Adele} and Florence + the Machine) and was asked to open for {artist: Coldplay} on a recent American tour. So {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} were eager to have this rising star perform in the studio. They describe her music as a mix of {artist: Nina Simone} and {artist: Lauryn Hill}. 

## 00:43:24 Review: Low
![The Invisible Way](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/384/20C0.jpg)

There's a lot to be impressed by when it comes to {artist: Low}. First, they've consistently made good records for two decades. Second, the two core members, {name: Mimi Parker} and {name: Alan Sparhawk}, have managed to do all that while maintaining a marriage and family. On the most recent {label: Sub Pop} release {album: The Invisible Way}, the band has tweaked the formula a bit, and for the better, according to {host: Greg}. {tag: Bassist} {name: Steve Garrington} is playing a lot more piano. And Mimi is singing more. Greg loves her voice, especially on anthems like "{track: So Blue}." Professor DeRogatis has always given Low a B+, but {host: Jim} thinks {album: The Invisible Way} is an A+ masterpiece. The songwriting, and especially the religious imagery, is deeper and more ambiguous giving Low a double {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:50:16 DIJ: Greg
After a recent experience seeing {artist: Emmylou Harris}, {host: Greg} was reminded of the songwriting talent of the great {artist: Townes Van Zandt}. Many, including Ms. Harris, have performed his song "{track: Pancho and Lefty}," but it's the Townes original that Greg wants to have with him on the island. The song tells the tale of two men living on the margins of society, and wonders who fares better: Pancho, who is betrayed and left to die, or Lefty, who is left alone "livin in cheap hotels."
