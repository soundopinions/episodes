## 00:01:45 Intro: Music News
After being heralded as the next wave of music retail, Starbucks' {label: Hear Music} label is folding and moving its artists to {label: Concord Music}. Apparently {tag: Starbucks} has realized that physical music sales is not an easy business. And now artists like {artist: Paul McCartney}, {artist: James Taylor} and {artist: Sia} won't be able to depend on the coffee chain for their...um...buzz.

{host: Jim} and {host: Greg}'s next news item concerns one of the biggest selling bands of all time: {artist: Coldplay}. But this time, the British {genre: pop} group is making headlines for making absolutely no money at all. The {name: Chris Martin}-fronted band released their new single "{track: Violet Hill}" as a free download earlier this week, and so far their strategy is a success. Within a day over 600,000 people downloaded the song the song for free. Jim and Greg will review the {name: Brian Eno}-produced album when it comes out in June, but right now they're more interested in this promotional plan. In the music industry's new era, even a band as established as Coldplay has to shake up the formula to get and keep fans.

## 00:10:31 Interview: Laurie Anderson
Another artist who is never afraid to try new things is {artist: Laurie Anderson}, Jim and Greg's guest this episode. Anderson has been making music, along with other forms of art, for almost 30 years. But, as she explains, her career began by accident. Anderson's song "{track: O Superman}" became a surprise hit in the {place: UK} and got her a recording contract. That never stopped Anderson from experimenting though. As {tag: NASA}'s first and only artist-in-residence, it's always been important for her to explore lots and lots of areas, and never become "an expert." This attitude contributed to Anderson's decision not to cancel her {place: Chicago} show on {tag: September 11}, 2001. {host: Greg} remembers her performance that night as one of the most powerful he's ever witnessed.

## 00:39:41 Review: The Roots
![Rising Down (Bonus Version)](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/127/1U50.jpg)

{genre: Hip hop} group {artist: The Roots} released its 10th album this week, {album: Rising Down}. The band started out with a more {genre: neo-soul} vibe, but as Greg points out, over the years The Roots have gotten a lot harder and edgier. Some of the album's songs are downright creepy, and {host: Greg} loves {name: ?uestlove}'s drumming. But he can't go so far as to give it a {tag: Buy It}. Jim has loved a number of Roots' albums, especially {era: 1999}'s {album: Things Fall Apart}, but he finds their efforts inconsistent. This time around The Roots called in a number of guest stars, but {host: Jim} wishes they had stuck to their own members. {album: Rising Down} has some good moments, but both critics can only give it a {tag: Try It}.

## 00:48:22 Review: Portishead
![Third](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/127/28M0.jpg)

Now onto the {place: U.K.}'s answer to hip hop... {genre: trip hop}. {artist: Portishead}, pioneers of the moody, sample-based genre, also have a new album out called {album: Third}. It's the group's first album in 10 years, so fans have been heavily anticipating what they have to offer. But, Greg is concerned that people accustomed to the cool, sophisticated sound of {era: 1994}'s {album: Dummy} will be taken aback. {album: Third} is no dinner-party soundtrack. It's jarring and subversive, but {host: Greg} loves it. {host: Jim} agrees, but doesn't think it's actually a radical reinvention. Singer {name: Beth Gibbons} has always been moody, only now she is looking outward rather than in. And the music is still filled with synths, beats and weird sounds. Both Jim and Greg give {album: Third} a {tag: Buy It}.
