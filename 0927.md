## 00:00:40 Review: Big Freedia

{artist : Big Freedia} is known as “The Queen of Bounce” and has done more than arguably anyone else to spread that New Orleans style of dance music around the world. Their new album, “{album : Central City}” is only their second full length studio album, though they are constantly releasing new music. Hosts Jim and Greg both love the new effort and say it’s a welcome addition to their late summer listening.

Greg notes that with {artist : Al Green}’s recent cover of “{track : Perfect Day}” by {artist : Lou Reed}, it’s high time to acknowledge that the song has been having a cultural moment for a few years now.
