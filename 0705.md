## 00:34:36 Interview: Ex Hex

{artist : Ex Hex} is a trio who celebrate {genre : guitar rock}, even 1980s albums by bands like {artist : Def Leppard} and {artist : Poison}, which is surprising if you consider the indie rock scene from which they sprang. {artist : Mary Timony} was the singer and guitarist of {artist : Helium} for much of the {era : 1990s} and before that the short-lived {artist : Autoclave}. Both were groups that could almost be considered the exact opposite of {genre : arena rock}. But, as she tells {host : Jim} and {host : Greg}, Timony heard bands like {artist : Van Halen} with fresh ears when working as a guitar teacher after quitting music in her mid-30s. Students would ask to learn {genre : classic rock} songs and in order to teach them, Timony would learn them, too. When members of {artist : Sleater Kinney} and {artist : The Minders} asked her to join the supergroup {artist : Wild Flag} in 2010, she brought her new knowledge of guitar shredding with her: rolling on the floor and doing windmill guitar moves frequently while on tour.

When Wild Flag split up before doing a second album, Timony took the songs she'd already started and formed Ex Hex with {name : Betsy Wright} of {artist : Bat Fangs} and drummer {name : Laura Harris}. Ex Hex takes that guitar hero aspect and turns it up to eleven. On their second album, {album : It's Real}, Ex Hex seems to be fully committed to this approach to music that would have been so at odds with Timony's early work. As our audience at the Goose Island Tap Room knows, the band is more concerned with making good, fun music than expressing deep angst.
