# Show 634: New Wave & Alison Moyet

![New Wave](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2018/flock_of.jpg)

{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} talk to {name: Lori Majewski} about her book *Mad World: An Oral History of New Wave Artists and the Songs That Defined the 1980s*, co-written with Jonathan Bernstein. In it, the authors reveal why {genre: New Wave} caught on so strongly with {genre: pop} fans and the media, especially {genre: post-punk} in the {place: U.K.} Plus, an interview with {artist: Alison Moyet}, an English {genre: singer-songwriter} that came up in the New Wave scene, and is still making waves musically.


## 00:01:31 Feature: New Wave
No one of a certain age can hear "{track: Rio}" without picturing {name: Simon LeBon} and the members of {artist: Duran Duran} crooning off the side of a yacht. They were the "{artist: Rolling Stones} of the {genre: New Wave} era" according to writer {name: Lori Majewski}, and those videos represented everything you either love or hate about the {era: 1980s}â€”the excess, the sex, the fashion and the pure {genre: pop} production. But, while this was a very visual era of music (with infamous clothes and even more infamous hair), there's a lot to be said for the sound, which was made possible by then-new technology like the digital synthesizer. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} talk to Lori about her 2014 book {tag: *Mad World: An Oral History of New Wave Artists and the Songs That Defined the 1980s*}, co-written with {name: Jonathan Bernstein}. In it, the authors reveal why New Wave caught on so strongly with pop fans and the media, especially post-punk in the U.K. (Certainly the {tag: *NME*} would rather photograph {artist: Adam Ant} than a spitting {name: Johnny Rotten}).


## 00:28:37 Interview: Alison Moyet

Songs like "{track: Only You}" and "{track: Situation}" showcased her soulful vocals and dynamic voice. Since the group broke up in 1983, she's gone on to have a successful solo career and recently released her latest album, {album: Other}, which talks about the beauty in diversity, change and more. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} talk to Alison about her new material, lifestyle changes and being an outsider in the music industry.
