![Start](https://mcusercontent.com/d44d9928fb4c332abb986525c/images/1a7f2f73-9c79-41d6-a1fc-4663d3c082e2.jpg)

Oftentimes the best way to celebrate a new venture is with great music, and we could all use a fresh start right about now. Hosts Jim DeRogatis and Greg Kot share some of their favorite songs about new beginnings. They also review new records from country singer-songwriter {artist: Margo Price} ({album: That's How Rumors Get Started}) and the late Chicago rapper {artist: Juice WRLD} ({album: Legends Never Die}).
