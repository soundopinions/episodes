![I Want You Back](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2018/iwantyouback.jpg)


When candy, flowers, and love notes fail to woo your sweetie back, there's only one thing left to do: stake out under a window, hold up that boom box and blast an "{track: I Want You Back}" song. This {tag: Valentine's Day}, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} present their favorite pleading songs. Plus, they'll review the new album from {artist: Justin Timberlake}.


## 00:01:31 Review: Justin Timberlake
![Man of the Woods](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/637/2J0.jpg)

After a five year recording hiatus, {artist: Justin Timberlake} has returned with {album: Man of the Woods}. The album is a sonic departure from the soul-infused pop of his earlier releases such as {album: Justified} and {album: FutureSex/LoveSounds}. According to Jim, Justin's goal with Man of the Woods was to make an album that was "{genre: Americana} with {tag: 808s}â€¦ old {genre: country} with {tag: drum machines}." Jim loved that concept; but believes that despite production from {artist: The Neptunes} and {artist: Timbaland}, the resulting album fell flat. {host: Greg} finds the working man character on tracks like "{track: Livin' Off the Land}" hard to swallow, and calls "{track: Her}," a spoken word interlude featuring Justin's wife, {name: Jessica Biel}, to be "embarrassing" and a "Hallmark commercial." Ultimately, {host: Jim} questions whether the whole project is supposed to be taken seriously at all, or whether it's a "{tag: Portlandia}-level joke." The hosts give {album: Man of the Woods} a double {tag: Trash It}.
