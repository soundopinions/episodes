Since joining The Drive-By Truckers right out of high school, {artist : Jason Isbell} has been a formidable creative force. Since leaving the Truckers and getting sober, he's been on a hot streak with his group The 400 Unit. Their newest album, “{album : Weathervanes}” shows no signs of that streak cooling off. But the new album comes just after the Sam Jones documentary “Running With Our Eyes Closed” showed revealing struggles in the studio and at home during the making of Isbell's previous album, “Reunions.” In conversation with hosts Jim and Greg, Isbell is candid about where his head is at and what's next- including his acting debut in Martin Scorsese's “Killers of the Flower Moon.”
