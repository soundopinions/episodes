## 00:02:14 News: 05.29.09
First up is the news that one of music's most successful major label artists is going indie. {artist: Jay-Z} gave notice to {label: Def Jam}, the label for which he formerly served as president. He plans on being a "a completely independent artist." But, given his 360 deal with {tag: Live Nation}, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} aren't sure this statement carries much weight.

In other {genre: hip hop} news, rapper {artist: T.I.} has headed off to jail this week. He'll be serving a one year and one day sentence on a weapon charge. While this is not the first time an esteemed musician has served prison time, it is unique that both T.I.'s albums and singles are thriving on the {tag: Billboard} charts. So while the "{tag: King of the South}" takes a time out, his career moves on full steam ahead.

After years of singing about darkness and pain, {name: Trent Reznor} of {artist: Nine Inch Nails} is showing his softer side. He has helped a 27-year-old fan raise more than $800,000 for a life-saving heart {tag: transplant}. By asking fans to pay $350 for pre-show access and $1000 for dinner with the band, he has been successfully helping {name: Eric de la Cruz} to reach his goal. In one day alone, Reznor took in $250,000, proving he really is the master of web marketing and distribution.

Music fans were sad to learn of the death of {name: Jay Bennett} this week. The multi-instrumentalist and former {artist: Wilco} member died at the age of 45. While the cause of death is not known, what is known is Bennett's great talent. Many people take their image of him from the Wilco film {tag: I Am Trying to Break Your Heart}, but Jim and Greg both believe Bennett will be sorely missed and stress the positive effect he had on the band's music. In honor of Jay Bennett, they play "{track: Pieholden Suite}," from Wilco's {era: 1999} album {album: Summerteeth}.

## 00:11:48 Review: Wilco
![Wilco (The Album)](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music1/v4/54/19/f2/5419f2b3-bc8d-1a1a-adb7-777b358049c5/source/600x600bb.jpg "147603/926186587")
Just as they are dealing with the news of Jay Bennett's death, the members of {artist: Wilco} are preparing to release their seventh studio record. {album: Wilco (The Album)} features "{track: Wilco (The Song)}," one of their best according to Greg. {host: Jim} agrees, but doesn't think the album breaks any ground for the band. He calls it a summing up, albeit a perfectly executed summing up. {host: Greg} wouldn't argue, but did hear a few more surprises. Either way, both hosts give {album: Wilco (The Album)} a {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:19:14 Interview: Dan Deacon
{host: Jim} and {host: Greg}'s guest this week is {artist: Dan Deacon}. Or rather, {name: Dan Deacon}'s guests are Jim and Greg. He welcomed our hosts for a conversation and live performance before his recent show at the {tag: Metro} in {place: Chicago}. Dan is known for creating {genre: electronic} magic with his laptop computer and keyboards and for his energetic, unique performance style. He's often right in the middle of the audience, sweating and dancing -- nerd punk style, if you will. For Jim and Greg he stayed onstage with his band, but the music was no less amazing. 

## 00:47:02 Review: Grizzly Bear
![Veckatimest](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/ec/4e/c4/ec4ec404-b318-2914-5d03-aeca2d519c75/source/600x600bb.jpg "29836830/314837656")
The final album up for review is the third release from {place: Brooklyn} quartet {artist: Grizzly Bear}. {album: Veckatimest}, named for an island off the coast of {place: Massachusetts}, is already getting hailed by many as one of the top albums of the year. {host: Jim} hears a lot of similarities to what bands like {artist: Fleet Foxes} and {artist: Blitzen Trapper} are doing, but with the addition of synths, {artist: Jeff Buckley}-style vocals, and lo-fi production. In other words, it drives him crazy. A few moments of beauty, but he gives it a {tag: Try It}. {host: Greg} loves how the band creates its own space in the album. He can picture the room they made it in. The record is not accessible, but when you are in the right mood to be shut in, {album: Veckatimist} will hit you. Greg gives it a {tag: Buy It} rating.
