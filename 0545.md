# Show 545: Seinabo Sey & Opinions on Brian Eno

![Seinabo Sey](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2016/seinabosey_web.jpg)

{place: Swedish} {genre: neo-soul} singer {artist: Seinabo Sey} is emerging as a major voice in {genre: pop} music, blending {genre: R&B} and {place: Africa}n rhythms. She joins Jim and Greg for a conversation and performance. Then they review the new album from pioneering {genre: ambient} producer {artist: Brian Eno}.


## 00:02:04 News: 05.06.16
The hype of {artist: Beyoncé}'s {album: Lemonade} has effectively swept the nation–all 12 tracks rank among the {tag: Billboard} Hot 100, the phrase 'good hair' will never again be used so nonchalantly, and the singer has become the first act to not only reach #1 with her first six studio albums, but also debut at that top spot. 

As we've said before, death is always a good career move. And {artist: Prince} is also having a good sales week. While it remains to be seen who will benefit from such sales,  five Prince albums–including some "Greatest Hits"– rank among the top 10. This feat hasn't been achived since 1963. While {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} understand the outpouring of affection for the Minneapolis singer, they aren't sure why fans need to own multiple copies of "{track: Kiss}."

![Dweezil and Frank](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2016/dweezilfrank.jpg)
Guitarist {artist: Dweezil Zappa}, son of rock legend {name: Frank [Zappa]}, has made changes to the name of his current tour "{tag: Zappa plays Zappa}" to avoid a  $150,000 lawsuit threatened against him by his siblings. Since Frank's widow {name: Gail Zappa} died in October, two of the four Zappa children, {artist: Ahmet [Zappa]} and {name: Diva [Zappa]}, control the {tag: Zappa Family Trust}. It was this trust that informed Dweezil he did not have the permission to tour under his act's former name. So, he's being forced to tour as "{tag: Dweezil Zappa plays Frank Zappa}." Doesn't exactly roll off the tongue, does it?

## 00:07:26 Interview: Seinabo Sey

{tag: Swedish} artist {artist: Seinabo Sey} may be a bit of an old soul, but her music is breaking new ground. This week, {host: Greg} and {host: Jim} chat with {genre: pop}/{genre: neo soul} singer Seinabo Sey, who just released her debut album {album: Pretend}. Sey was raised in {place: Sweden}, born to a Swedish mother and a Gambian father (musician {tag: Maudo Sey}), but growing up, she idolized American {genre: pop} & {genre: R&B} stars like {artist: Beyoncé}, {artist: Lauryn Hill}, {artist: Erykah Badu} and {artist: Alicia Keys}, which is evident in her sound.

A few years ago, she teamed up with {tag: Magnus Lidehäll}, an accomplished producer who has worked with {artist: Katy Perry}, {artist: David Guetta}, {artist: Avicii} and more. The result really lets Sey's authetic voice shine through. 


## 00:43:49 Review: Brian Eno
![The Ship](//static.soundopinions.org/assets/545/2110.jpg "38124/1083897139")
If you've ever listened to Sound Opinions, you've learned one thing – {host: Jim} loves himself some {artist: Brian Eno}. Eno has worn many hats over his long career, starting as a member of {artist: Roxy Music}, collaborating with artists like {artist: David Bowie}, and producing commercial successes for {artist: U2}, {artist: Talking Heads}, and {artist: Coldplay}. His own solo output has varied wildly in style, recording {genre: pop} albums in the {era: '70s} and basically inventing {genre: ambient} music. His latest work, {album: The Ship}, is a concept album about the {tag: Titanic} and the slaughter of {tag: World War I}. {host: Greg} says Eno is finally merging his pop and ambient music, resulting in one of his best albums yet. He's freed himself from traditional song structures and rhythms to create cinematic images filled with orchestral synthesizer colors. Greg gives it a {tag: Buy It}, impressed that Eno is still coming up with new ways to express himself. In a shocking turn of events, Jim is less impressed. He thinks that Eno's voice is the strongest tool in his arsenal, yet here he's burying it under the mix and fussing with {tag: Vocoder}s. Jim loves some ambient Eno, but feels he's done it better than on The Ship. But Jim says the {genre: doo-wop} inflected cover of {artist: The Velvet Underground}'s "{track: I'm Set Free}" is amazing, earning {album: The Ship} a {tag: Try It} rating.


## 00:51:11 DIJ: Greg
Lost in the global media spotlight on {artist: Prince}'s death was the passing of another important musical innovator – guitarist {artist: Lonnie Mack}, who died at 74 on April 21. Born an {place: Indiana} farmboy, Mack inspired generations of artists by blending {genre: country}, {genre: blues}, and {genre: soul} on his famous {tag: Flying V} guitar. He was one of the first to turn the {tag: whammy bar} into a true textural instrument. But {host: Greg} feels Mack's vocal style is sadly underrated. He was a true soul singer, and Greg calls his recording of "{track: Why}" from the {era: 1963} debut album {album: The Wham of That Memphis Man!} one of the great vocal performances of the era. Because of that, it's Greg's {tag: Desert Island Jukebox} selection of the week.
