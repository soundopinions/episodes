![Al Green](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2017/algreen_web.jpg)

{artist: Al Green} sang some of the most acclaimed {genre: soul} songs of the {era: 1970s}. So when he decided to leave it all behind for the church, many questioned why. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} discuss Al Green's life and his pivotal transitional record, {album: The Belle Album}, with biographer {name: Jimmy McDonough}. Plus, a review of new music from {artist: Taylor Swift}.




## 00:02:19 Classic Album Dissection: The Belle Album
![The Belle Album](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/fe/71/ee/fe71ee96-28c1-02f9-99a1-1f38e7ab4393/source/600x600bb.jpg "99603/1196494913")

{artist: Al Green} is known for archetypal {genre: soul} hits like "{track: Love & Happiness}," "{track: Let's Stay Together}," and "{track: I'm So Tired of Being Alone}." But, while Al's songs are known around the world, the man himself is a bit of an enigma. To get a better sense of who Al Green is, Jim and Greg sat down with {name: Jimmy McDonough}, author of a new biography called {name: Soul Survivor}.

 They also unpack a lesser known album from Al Green's catalogue: {album: The Belle Album}. The album, released in {era: 1977}, came out at a crucial period in Green's life. He had just left a lucrative career in soul music for the ministry. The album was his first {genre: gospel} album, one that blended {genre: funk}, {genre: disco}, and according to Jim, even elements of {genre: punk}. It was also Al's first dip into self-producing an album. His previous work had been produced by the legendary {name: Willie Mitchell} at {label: Hi Records} in {place: Memphis}. The album with its rough, almost garage-gospel sound is an outlier among Green's earlier works. {album: The Belle Album} means a lot to both Jim and Greg. Greg calls it "a transitional album that was also a masterpiece."



## 00:43:47 Review: Taylor Swift
![reputation](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music128/v4/bc/84/77/bc847733-8fcd-1040-8ddb-4271601f4151/source/600x600bb.jpg "159260351/1274999981")
{artist: Taylor Swift} has been the most dominant pop star of the last decade, selling record-setting numbers of albums and winning 10 Grammy Awards (two for album of the year.) She's back for her 6th studio album, {album: reputation}, which she collaborated on with star producers {name: Max Martin}, {name: Shellback} and {name: Jack Antonoff}. {host: Jim} compares reputation to a brand new, state-of-the-art {tag: Tesla}. It's got everything a person could ever want, but it's just *too* perfect. While he thinks that Swift is a talented lyricist and performer, he's irritated that she's still letting petty feuds with {artist: Kanye West} and various ex-boyfriends dominate her music. However, Jim believes there are some solid pop moments on reputation and gives it a {tag: Try It}. {host: Greg} agrees that as a writer and performer, Taylor is one of the strongest in the {genre: pop} landscape. However, he finds the record to be sonically overproduced and feels Swift is less relatable because of some of the superficial content she sings about on reputation. For Greg there are highlights of pop brilliance ("{track: Getaway Car}") and his favorite track is the stripped-down acoustic closer "{track: New Year's Day}." He thinks it's the embodiment of Swift's strengths and she's singing about something genuine. Greg gives reputation a {tag: Try It}.
