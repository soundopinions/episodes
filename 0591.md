# Show 591: Remembering Chuck Berry

![Chuck Berry](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2017/chuckberry_web.jpg)

{artist : Chuck Berry}, one of the architects of {genre : rock 'n' roll}, has died at age 90. {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} reflect on the life, music, and enduring legacy of the legendary guitarist, lyricist, and singer.



## 00:01:45 Special: Remembering Chuck Berry

Born in {place : St. Louis} in 1926, {artist : Chuck Berry} began his professional music career fairly late in life. In fact, his breakthrough hit, 1955's {track : "Maybellene"} was recorded when Berry was 28 years old.

{host : Jim} says that Berry helped craft the very identity of {genre : rock and roll}, often name checking the burgeoning genre in his lyrics.  Berry's songwriting on tracks like {track : "School Day"} and {track : "Roll Over Beethoven"} deftly expressed the angst and rebelliousness of youth culture; and his guitar-led sound influenced rock outfits for generations to come. According to Jim, the Berry attitude: "sly, sarcastic, risque... conspiratiorial" is an element of his persona that has served as a template for rockers, as well. {host : Greg} notes that in addition to teen anthems, Chuck Berry's catalogue also contains sophisticated lyrics, like those found in 1959's {tag : "Memphis, Tennessee"}, a song about a father estranged from his 6 year old daughter, Marie.

To learn more about {artist : Chuck Berry}'s life and legacy, Greg and Jim spoke with {name : Ed Ward}, a writer and author of *The History of Rock & Roll Volume 1: 1920 - 1963.* Ed also wrote the seminal rock criticism book {name : "Rock of Ages: The Rolling Stone History of Rock & Roll."}

The hosts also sat down with drummer {name : Steven Gillis}. Steven played with Chuck Berry at a 2011 Chicago concert that made headlines when the then-84 year old rock legend had to be rushed to the hospital mid-show.  Steven shares his memories of sharing the stage with Berry that night.
