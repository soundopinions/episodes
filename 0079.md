# Show 79: Cover Songs
Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery...or so they say. This week on Sound Opinions Jim and Greg will discuss rock music's form of imitation: the cover song. Tune in to hear the hosts' picks for best cover songs, as well as some of yours. Then, they'll review new cover albums from Patti Smith and Bryan Ferry.

## 00:01:45 List: Best Cover Songs
In the age of karaoke and "American Idol," it's easy to forget how great a {genre: cover song} can be. But, as Jim and Greg discuss, an artist's interpretation of someone else's song can often be better than the original. In those cases, the performer brings passion and a new spin to a song. During the course of the show, Jim and Greg run down their picks for best cover songs. (For an even longer list of noteworthy cover songs, go to the thread on the Sound Opinions Message Board.)

### Greg
- {artist: Isaac Hayes}' cover of "{track: By the Time I Get to Phoenix}" by {artist: Jimmy Webb} 
- {artist: Richard Thompson}'s cover of "{track: Oops...I Did It Again}," by {artist: Britney Spears}
- {artist: The Clash}'s cover of "{track: Police On My Back}," by {artist: The Equals}
- {artist: Tricky}'s cover of "{track: Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos}") by {artist: Public Enemy}

### Jim
- {artist: The Byrds}' cover of "{track: Mr. Tambourine Man}" by {artist: Bob Dylan}
- {artist: John Cale}'s cover of "{track: Hallelujah}" by {artist: Leonard Cohen}
- {artist: Hüsker Dü}'s cover of "{track: Eight Miles High}," by {artist: The Byrds}
- {artist: The Kingsmen}'s cover of "{track: Louie, Louie}" by {artist: Richard Berry}

### Listeners' Picks:
- Ian: {artist: Bauhaus}' cover of "{track: Ziggy Stardust}" by {artist: David Bowie}
- Scott: {artist: Johnny Cash}'s cover of "{track: Personal Jesus}" by {artist: Depeche Mode}
- Jim: {artist: Slayer}'s cover of "{track: In A Gadda Da Vida}" by {artist: Iron Butterfly}
- Christine: {artist: The Sundays}' cover of "{track: Wild Horses}" by {artist: The Rolling Stones}

The inspiration for this show's theme came from the recent release of three new albums that all celebrate the art of the cover song. Jim and Greg take on all three to see how they fare on the Buy It, Burn It, Trash It rating system.

## 00:44:03 Review: Bryan Ferry
![Dylanesque](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/79/21F0.jpg)
First up is {album: Dylanesque}, {artist: Bryan Ferry}'s new collection of {artist: Bob Dylan} {genre: cover}s. Ferry is one of rock's quintessential cover artists, having brought his own spin to songs like "{track: Jealous Guy}" and "{track: Like a Hurricane}." In fact, {album: Dylanesque} is the former {artist: Roxy Music} front man's fifth covers album. But, this time around, Jim and Greg don't think that Ferry fares as well. {host: Greg} explains that he isn't really taking the songs anywhere new, though he appreciates how Ferry has keyed into the strengths of Dylan's melodies. He gives it a {tag: Burn It}. {host: Jim} was also disappointed in {album: Dylanesque}, but thinks that fans of Ferry should definitely {tag: Burn It}.

## 00:49:36 Review: Patti Smith
![Twelve](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/79/2AO0.jpg)
{artist: Patti Smith} is another artist who is known for her ability to do a great {genre: cover} song. Early on in her career she did successful rendition of songs like {artist: Van Morrison}'s "{track: Gloria}" and {artist: Bruce Springsteen}'s "{track: Because the Night}." Now she has a collection of cover songs called {album: Twelve}. Jim thinks there are many "interesting" covers on this album, but interesting doesn't necessarily mean good. Patti Smith is still a vital artist though, so {host: Jim} recommends listeners {tag: Burn It} just to sample her versions of famous songs. {host: Greg} is also a big Patti Smith fan, so it pains him to say that most of the songs on {album: Twelve} are poor and predictable. He shocks Jim and Sound Opinions H.Q. with a {tag: Trash It} rating.

## 00:52:14 Review: A Tribute to Joni Mitchell
![A Tribute to Joni Mitchell](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/79/2F20.jpg)
The last album up for review is {album: A Tribute to Joni Mitchell}. On this album, tracks penned by the famous songwriter are performed by {artist: Prince}, {artist: Sufjan Stevens}, {artist: James Taylor} and {artist: Elvis Costello} among them. {host: Greg} explains that {artist: Joni Mitchell} is a difficult artist to {genre: cover}, and with the exception of singers like {artist: Caetano Veloso}, many of the artists on this tribute just simply aren't good enough to tackle her work. {host: Jim} agrees, noting that all of the artists on the album are on the {label: Nonesuch} roster. He predicts that the record would have been stronger if more obscure performers were chosen. Therefore {album: A Tribute to Joni Mitchell} gets two {tag: Burn It}s.
