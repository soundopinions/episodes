## 00:01:45 News: 06.06.08
Every week Sound Opinions reports music news, but we've never before been in it. As many listeners are probably aware, this was a busy week for our host Jim. His reporting was central to the indictment of {genre: R&B} star {artist: R. Kelly}, who is currently on trial for charges of {tag: child pornography}. So, on the day this episode of Sound Opinions was taped, Jim was required to appear in court. Upon advice of his {tag: Chicago Sun-Times} counsel, he cited the first and fifth amendments and did not have to testify. Sound Opinions will keep you updated as the trial progresses, and we look forward to having Jim back next week. 

{artist: Bo Diddley} died this week at the age of 79. Greg discusses how much of an impact the former boxer made on rock and roll and how he never got the credit he deserves. This is largely because Diddley was ahead of his time, but by the time the Brits invaded the music scene, it was apparent what a musical stamp he left. Read Greg's obituary of Diddley [here](http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/chi-bo-diddley-story.html).

## 00:10:25 List: Ultimate Summer Mixtape
{tag: Summer} officially begins in a couple of weeks, and in honor of these lazy, hazy days and hot, sweaty nights, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} have decided to re-run one of their favorite shows which celebrates the best songs of the season. These are the tracks that would make up their ultimate summer mix-tape:

- {artist: The Rivieras}, "{track: California Sun}"

- {artist: Patti Smith}, "{track: Dancing Barefoot}"
- {artist: Wire}, "{track: Sand in My Joints}"
- {artist: Wreckx-N-Effect}, "{track: Rump Shaker}"
- {artist: Big Bad Voodoo Daddy}, "{track: Mr. Heatmiser}"
- {artist: Sly and the Family Stone}, "{track: Hot Fun in the Summertime}"
- {artist: Bananarama}, "{track: Cruel Summer}"
