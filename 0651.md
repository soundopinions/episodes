For the last 50 years, {artist: John Prine} has garnered a multi-generational fan base through his nuanced storytelling as a songwriter and performer.

## 00:01:16 Interview: John Prine
![John Prine](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2018/john_prine5.jpg)
This week, our guest is {genre: singer-songwriter} {artist: John Prine}. Born and raised just outside of {place: Chicago}, Prine began his career as a mailman and started writing {genre: folk} songs along his route. He performed them live in the Chicago folk scene and was soon signed to a major label. While he put out great releases in the '{era: 70s}, record companies often didn't know what to do with him - he was a talented songwriter and a gregarious performer, but he just didn't fit the rock mold at the time. Prine started his own label {label: Oh Boy Records} in 1984 and has remained independent since. Over time, Prine has managed to get better at his craft while also having to overcome cancer, which altered his singing and speaking voice, making it deeper and more gravelly. His latest album, {album: The Tree of Forgiveness}, is his first in 13 years and is his best performing album of his entire career. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} talk with John about his career journey, writing songs like "{track: Sam Stone}" and about working with everyone from {artist: Steve Goodman} to {tag: Phil Spector}.


## 00:41:41 Review: Courtney Barnett
![Tell Me How You Really Feel](https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music118/v4/10/0e/07/100e07ff-6c49-0baf-16f9-09999aed86e5/source/600x600bb.jpg "479276137/1341943567")
Jim thinks that {artist: Courtney Barnett} is one of the most important discoveries of the past decade. Her well-received debut album, 2015's {album: Sometimes I Sit and Think, and Sometimes I Just Sit}, helped to introduce her clever lyricism and skillful guitar work to the world. Her 2017 album with {artist: Kurt Vile}, {album: Lotta Sea Lice}, followed. And for fans of Barnett, her sophomore solo album, {album: Tell Me How You Really Feel}, doesn't disappoint. Greg notes there is "a little bit of humor" and fun. He likes her penchant for writing about "everyday details" and her ability to "boil it down for you in just a few words." Jim enjoys both the "melodic riffs, and the wonderful squalls of noise" that draw comparisons to {artist: Kurt Cobain}. But he notes that Courtney's lyricism is much more poetic than Cobain. On this album, she touches on issues like {tag: misogyny}, with songs like "{track: Nameless, Faceless}" which quotes {name: Margaret Atwood}, who once said that "Men are afraid that women will laugh at them. Women are afraid that men will kill them." Both {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} give the album an enthusiastic {tag: Buy It}.
