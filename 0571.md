On {album: What's Going On}, Gaye wrote and sang about polarizing and controversial topics at the time, like racism, the environment, drugs and the Vietnam War. He also wrote about his personal struggles, such as difficulties within his marriage and the heartbreaking death of his duet partner and close friend {artist: Tammi Terrell}.

## 00:44:18 Review: Common
![Black America Again (feat. Stevie Wonder) - Single](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/f4/b5/79/f4b579ee-d065-1b31-7da4-00bd877dca3d/source/600x600bb.jpg "64490/1159055707")

  {artist: Common} is one of the many {genre: hip-hop} talents to come out of {place: Chicago} in the last 15 or so years. His masterful free-styling and charisma took him beyond music to an acting career that, at times, took away from his music career. {host: Greg} says his latest, {album: Black America Again}, is a return to the vitality of his early albums. He hears Common taking on the role of a "spiritual messenger" as he weaves together African-American history with music resulting in a concept album about the continuing struggle for full freedom for African-Americans. It is a {tag: Buy It} for Greg. {host: Jim} wholeheartedly agrees, as Common's mastery of words mixes humor with super serious messages resulting in an honesty to his songs. {album: Black America Again} is a double Buy It. 


## 00:50:39 DIJ: Greg
{artist: [Bob] Dylan} is not America's only great literary songwriter. {artist: John Prine}, now 70, has been championed by legendary figures from {artist: Johnny Cash}, {artist: Kris Kristofferson}, {artist: Bonnie Raitt}, and Dylan himself. Born in {place: Maywood}, {place: Illinois}, Prine moved to {place: Chicago} as a young man, performing three times a week at an open mic night at a club called {place: The Fifth Peg} where he was discovered. Even at that young age, {host: Greg} feels his songs featured an astounding amount of empathy. That's best seen in "{track: Angel From Montgomery}," written from the perspective of a 47-year-old woman trapped in a marriage. Greg nominates Prine's 1970 live performance at the Fifth Peg, when he was still an unknown, to the Desert Island Jukebox.
