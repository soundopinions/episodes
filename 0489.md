# Show 489: Sleater Kinney and Opinions on Death Cab for Cutie

![sleater](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2015/sleater_web.jpg)

{genre : Riot grrrl} pioneers {artist : Sleater-Kinney} have reunited after a decade-long hiatus to release a blistering new album. They stop by the studio for a performance and a career-spanning interview.



## 00:02:11 Intro: Music News

The original manuscript to {artist : Don McLean}'s {era : 1971} hit "{track : American Pie}" sold to an anonymous bidder at Christie's for $1.2 million – enough cash to buy a new Chevy and maybe even finally saturate that levee. McLean has always been cryptic about what his lyrics mean, but the 16-page document may offer some clues. {host : Greg} reads the song as a crash course in {genre : rock 'n' roll} history of the years between {artist : Buddy Holly}'s death and the writing of the song.

There's still another chance to bid on some {genre : pop} memorabilia, however: the estate of {name : Davy Jones} is putting several items belonging to the late {artist : [The] Monkees} singer on the auction block in May. If you're lucky, you might be able to snag some of his gold records, guitars, or costumes. But {host : Jim} is most excited about the {tag : tambourine} for sale – after {name : Linda McCartney} of {artist : Wings}, Jones may be the most famous tambourine player in {genre : rock}.

## 00:05:06 Interview: Sleater-Kinney

{name : Carrie Brownstein}, {name : Corrin Tucker} and {name : Janet Weiss} of {artist : Sleater-Kinney} had released their most critically lauded album to date, {album : The Woods}, in {era : 2005} when they decided to put the band on indefinite "hiatus." Now, 10 years later, they have returned with a [critically acclaimed](http://www.soundopinions.org/show/478/#sleaterkinney) new album, {album : No Cities to Love}, and sold out shows across the {place : United States}. {host : Greg} sat down with Carrie, Corin and Janet earlier this year and talked about the {genre : Riotgrrl} origins of the band, why exactly they decided to go on hiatus and why it was important to them to make such a high energy new album. {host : Greg} and {name : Carrie Brownstein} also talked about her new found fame as 1/2 of the comedic duo with [Fred Armisen](http://www.soundopinions.org/show/327/#fredarmisen) in {tag:

*Portlandia*}.



## 00:49:06 Review: Death Cab for Cutie

![Kintsugi](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/489/29U0.jpg)

{genre : Alternative rock} mainstay {artist : Death Cab for Cutie} has been going through some tough times lately and it's reflected in their latest record. {album : Kintsugi} is all about lead singer {name : Ben Gibbard}'s divorce from actress {name : Zooey Deschanel}. Plus founding member, guitarist and producer {name : Chris Walla} announced he would be departing from the band in 2014. {host : Greg} thinks that the turmoil within the band makes this feel like a solo record and the new producer didn't make much of an impact. While the album had the potential to be melodramatic, it luckily wasn't. The band just needed to get this record out of its system and Greg gives it a {tag : Try It}. {host : Jim} enjoys *Kintsugi* more than Greg, and likes how the band has brought in more {genre : electronic} sound and {tag : keyboards}. He finds it to be another fine collection of songs and gives it a {tag : Buy It}.
