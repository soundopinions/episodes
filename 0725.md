{host : Jim} and {host : Greg} offer up a {tag : classic album dissection} for {album : Exile on Main St.} by {artist : The Rolling Stones}, a recording that's still shrouded in mystique over 45 years later. Jim says that even after loving this album for decades, "he has yet to plumb the surface" of the double album. He adds, that the genre-blurring album reflects "the American music canon, the weirder things in Grandma's attic."

Exile on Main St. is the band's 10th studio album. In many ways, its dark, murky sound makes it a bit of an outlier in their extensive catalog. That often imitated sound was a product of being recorded in the basement of {artist : Keith Richards}'s villa in {place : France}. Jim and Greg explore the recording process, the sound and the infuence on what Greg calls "The Post-Exile generations" from the {artist : New York Dolls} to the {artist : White Stripes}.
