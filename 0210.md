# Show 210: Dhani Harrison & Opinions on Chris Brown

{name : Dhani Harrison} visits Sound Opinions with his band {artist : Thenewno2}. Harrison, the son of the late Beatle George, talks to {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} about his musical upbringing, the perils of celebrity and even {tag : *The Prisoner*}.

## 00:01:45 Intro: Music News

Last week {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} predicted that {artist : Susan Boyle} would be one of the year's biggest success stories. But they had no idea she'd make chart history. Despite coming in #2 on {tag : *Britain's Got Talent*}, Boyle shot to {tag : #1}on the {tag : U.S. charts} with over 700,000 copies sold. This is the biggest opening sales figure for any debut album since {artist : Snoop Dogg}'s in 1993-and that's during CD's heyday. Furthermore, Jim notes that Boyle's success is also remarkable in that only 6% of sales for {album : I Dreamed a Dream} were digital. One can imagine that Boyle's standards' covers appeal to an older demographic...one that still buys physical product...one that the record industry will continue to tap.

{name : Bob Keane}, the founder of {label : Del-Fi Records}, {tag : died} last week at the age of {tag : 87}. Keane was behind the sound of acts like the {artist : Bobby Fuller Four} and {artist : Ritchie Valens}, and as {host : Greg} explains, those Del-Fi recordings are highly coveted by collectors and music fans because the sound is so raw and pristine. Keane wanted listeners to really get a sense of each band. After both Fuller and Valens died tragically at young ages, Keane decided to close the Del-Fi doors in 1967. Jim and Greg play Valens' 1958 hit "{track : Come On. Let's Go}," in honor of Bob Keane.



## 00:08:35 Interview: Dhani Harrison

This week's guests are {name : Dhani Harrison} and his band {artist : Thenewno2}. The current incarnation of the fluid group consists of Dhani on {tag : guitar}, {name : Jonathan Sadoff} and {name : Jeremy Faccone} on guitar, {name : Nick Fyffe} on {tag : bass} and {name : Frank Zummo} on {tag : drums}. But the group's constant is Dhani, {tag : son} of the late Beatle {name : George Harrison}. The story of famous rock children going out for their own musical glory is nothing new, but Dhani actually resisted this path. After studying industrial design and physics at {place : Brown [University]}, he entered the car-racing world. Now he's returned home in a sense with Thenewno2's debut album {album : You Are Here}. As Dhani discusses with {host : Jim} and {host : Greg}, he chose the band's cryptic name in order to give the music some anonymity. He hopes listeners love or hate it based on the music alone, rather than his celeb status. So you be the judge: check out Thenewno2's performance live on the show.



## 00:41:17 Review: Chris Brown

![Graffiti (Deluxe Version)](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/210/1WT0.jpg)

Last week {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} reviewed {artist : Rihanna}'s new album {album : Rated R}. This week they look at her former boyfriend {artist : Chris Brown}'s new album {album : Graffiti}. The {genre : R&B} star's third album is being released only months after he pleaded guilty to assaulting Rihanna, and Jim and Greg hear more of a botched public relations attempt than a good record. The songs might have been innocuous had Brown not addressed the violent incident, but he does and seemingly without much remorse. To Greg it's a taudry he said/she said game. To Jim it's bad experimentation, not to mention creepy. Either way, it's a {tag : Trash It}.



## 00:48:59 DIJ: Greg

Talking with {name : Dhani Harrison} reminded Greg of {artist : George Harrison}'s often un-sung guitar skills. And one of George Harrison's biggest influences was {artist : Carl Perkins}. In fact all {artist : The Beatles} adored Perkins and his {genre : rockabilly} picking, Mersey beat sound they made famous. So for his {tag : Desert Island Jukebox} selection this week, Greg wanted to choose a song that referenced the Beatles' love of Carl Perkins and Harrison's terrific guitar work. "{track : Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby}" is his tribute to two quiet, talented guys.
