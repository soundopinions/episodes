They'll also review the first post-retirement album from hip-hop mogul Jay-Z and make holiday gift suggestions for the music lover in your life.

## 00:01:54 Intro: Music News
First up in the news is a discussion of the legacy of {genre: R&B} singer {artist: Ruth Brown}. She passed away earlier this week at the age of 78. One of the original divas, Brown helped establish {label: Atlantic Records} and the {genre: R&B} sound as we know it today. In fact, Greg explains that Brown even predates the great {artist: Ray Charles}. She also won a {tag: Tony Award} for her part in {tag: Black and Blue}, and starred as "Motormouth Maybelle" in {tag: Hairspray}. The singer was an activist in the music industry and pushed Atlantic to start the {tag: Rhythm and Blues Foundation}, which worked toward royalty reform and distributed millions of dollars directly to musicians in need.

## 00:04:35 Review: Jay-Z
![Kingdom Come](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/52/7N0.jpg)
After a much-hyped "retirement," {artist: Jay-Z} has returned with a new album, {album: Kingdom Come}. While many folks take up pottery or flock to Florida during their retirement, the {genre: hip-hop} star became a [CEO](http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/65356/jay-z-named-def-jam-presidentceo), bought a basketball team, and made a number of [cameos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViwtNLUqkMY&feature=kp). Perhaps this life didn't satisfy J-Hova, because he was compelled to return to rapping after only three years. But, neither {host: Jim} nor Greg can understand the urgency. To them, he just sounds bored. This is not a new issue for Jay-Z -- he's often been plagued with a great voice and very little to say. But {host: Greg} thinks {album: Kingdom Come} is his worst effort ever. The album gets two {tag: Trash It}s.

## 00:11:35 Review: Tom Waits
![Orphans](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/52/JB0.jpg)
Next up is a review of the new album by {artist: Tom Waits}. Longtime listeners know that Waits is often a bone of contention between our two hosts, and this time is no different. The new record, {album: Orphans}, is a three-disc set that began as a trip through the Waits archive. But Waits also added 30 new recordings to the mix. Jim thinks this is a perfect example of the songwriter's consistent inability to self-edit. He used to love Waits, but now just plain hates him. For {host: Jim}, Waits is an {genre: art-rock} caricature, and this album is a {tag: Trash It}. {host: Greg} is a tried and true Waits fan, and thinks that his storytelling is in top form. He is also interested in the sonics on {album: Orphans} and thinks it's one of Waits' best albums. He recommends listeners {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:21:46 Special: Turkey Shoot 2006
