## 00:01:49 News: 01.02.09
One of the biggest news stories of 2008 is undoubtedly the economy. But how does that relate to music? According to Professor {name: Terry Pettijohn} there are links between musical tastes and economic patterns. In a study published in  {tag: Psychology of Music}, Pettijohn and fellow researcher {name: Donald Sacco}, explain that during times of socioeconomic challenges, popular songs are more "meaningful." But, during easier times, the hits are more fun and frivolous. For example, during the economic boom of the late {era: '50s}, songs like "{track: At the Hop}" were all the rage. And in {era: 1968}, during a period of social unrest, people were attracted to "{track: Hey Jude}." So, what does this say about our current society?

## 00:11:55 Review: Common
![Universal Mind Control](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music1/v4/79/24/50/79245010-6abd-9535-c411-a8a66c14af95/dj.wzmltrdy.jpg/600x600bb-85.jpg "64490/298084892")

One of the big new releases this month is from rapper {artist: Common}. {album: Universal Mind Control} was initially supposed to be released over the summer, and Jim and Greg wonder if the party atmosphere would have been better suited for the warmer months. But, even the sunshine can't improve this disappointing album. Both {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} have lauded the {place: Chicago} native for years, so it breaks their hearts to see him reduced to what Jim describes as a "horrible, sexist, derogatory empty" album. With {era: 2008} being such a landmark year, particularly for African-Americans, Greg thinks {album: Universal Mind Control} was a missed opportunity for the usually thoughtful rapper. Both critics give Common's record a {tag: Trash It}.
