# Show 13: Feist and Beauty & the Beast Duets
On this week's episode of Sound Opinions, Jim DeRogatis and Greg Kot sit down with indie rock chanteuse, {artist: Feist}. Jim and Greg also review the new duet record by {artist: Isobel Campbell and Mark Lanegan} and look back at some of rock's other great duet performances.

## 00:02:17 Intro: Music News
This week {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} play scientist and talk to two professors, {name: P. Jason Rentfrow} of {tag: Cambridge} University and {name: Duncan Watts} of {tag: Columbia University}, about recent studies that seek to find out why we like the music we do. The first study asked college students to rate one another based on their favorite music. According to Dr. Rentfrow's findings, people who like music with a lot of vocals were found to be more extroverted. In addition, people who have eclectic taste in music were considered to be more open-minded and intellectually curious -- a fact that bodes well for Sound Opinions listeners.

The second experiment conducted at Columbia University confirmed two widely held suspicions: Most people are sheep, and you can't predict a hit. Duncan Watts and his graduate students asked participants to go online, listen to a selection of songs and download what they liked. The results showed that people tended to choose songs which had already been chosen a number of times. This may account for why some songs stay on the {tag: Billboard} charts for as long they do. The study also found that there was really no formula for song popularity. One song, "{track: Lockdown}" by {artist: 52Metro}, ranked first in one test, but only 40th out of 48 in another. 

The next story involves the perpetual newsmaker {artist: Michael Jackson}. After {tag: Hurricane Katrina} first devastated the gulf coast, Jackson announced that he would produce a single to raise money for disaster relief. Well, that was many moons ago, and the world has yet to hear a tune. Recently, however, an announcement was made regarding the song's status by the {artist: Prince of Bahrain}, the king of pop's newly crowned representative. {name: Sheik Abdullah bin Hamad Al Khalifa}, will release the record on his own {label: 2 Seas} label. While the song reunites Jackson with [partner-in-crime](http://www.allmusic.com/song/you-are-not-alone-mt0033168301) {artist: R. Kelly}, as well as {artist: Ciara} and {artist: Snoop Dogg}, it does not have the star power of previous releases like "{track: We Are the World}."

## 00:16:49 Interview: Feist
This week's guest is {name: Leslie Feist}, an up-and-coming {genre: singer/songwriter}. Born in {place: Calgary} and bred in the {place: Toronto} music scene, Feist is one of many Canadian {genre: indie} acts rising in popularity. It seems that our neighbor to the north is the next {place: Seattle} or {place: Portland}. Bands like {artist: Broken Social Scene} and {artist: Peaches}, who can both claim {artist: Feist} as collaborators, plus {artist: The Arcade Fire}, {artist: Wolf Parade}, {artist: Metric}, {artist: Stars}, {artist: The Constantines}, {artist: Hidden Cameras}, and {artist: Death from Above 1979}, are all coming out of {place: Canada} (and are all a far cry from {artist: Shania Twain} or {artist: Bryan Adams}). During her interview with {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}, {artist: Feist} performs "{track: Gatekeeper}," "{track: Mushaboom}," and a cover of "{track: Secret Heart}" by {artist: Ron Sexsmith}. There are a number of covers on her latest album, {album: Let It Die}, including "{track: In and Out}" by {artist: The Bee Gees} and "{track: Now at Last}" by {artist: Blossom Dearie}. 

## 00:41:51 List: "Beauty and the Beast" Duets 
The album up for review this week is {album: Ballad of the Broken Seas} by {name: Isobel Campbell} and {name: Mark Lanegan}. Before our hosts review the new record, they take a look back at a few of rock's other "Beauty and the Beast" duets: 

 - {artist: Emmylou Harris and Gram Parsons}, "{track: Love Hurts}"
 - {artist: Serge Gainsbourg and Brigitte Bardot}, "{track: Bonnie and Clyde}"
 - {artist: Ja Rule and Ashanti}, "{track: Always on Time}" 
 - {artist: Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazlewood}, "{track: Some Velvet Morning}"

## 00:53:41 Review: Isobel Campbell & Mark Lanegan
![Ballad of the Broken Seas](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/13/2HH0.jpg)
After listening to some of {artist: [Mark] Lanegan} and {artist: [Isobel] Campbell}'s predecessors, Jim and Greg discuss their modern take on the "Beauty and the Beast" formula. Many people know Lanegan from his days with the {artist: Screaming Trees} in the {era: '90s}. Campbell recently [left](http://www.absolutelyrics.com/lyrics/view/belle_%26_sebastian/dress_up_in_you/) {artist: Belle and Sebastian}, a band Jim and Greg [reviewed](/show/12/) last week, and her first move was asking Lanegan to join her for a duet album, {album: Ballad of the Broken Seas}. While in many of the songs above, the Beast seems to be preying on the poor innocent female, it is {name: Isobel Campbell} who is controlling most of the content on the record. Her voice is a sweet counterpart to {name: [Mark] Lanegan}'s low, masculine rumble, but she was the {tag: songwriter} and the {tag: producer}. Both {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} give her efforts a "{tag: Buy It}" rating.

## 00:53:11 DIJ: Jim
{host: Jim} picks a song to add to the **{tag: Desert Island Jukebox}** this week. All that talk about {place: Canada} got him thinking about one of his favorite bandsâ€”{artist: Rush}. This band might not always get a lot of respect, but Jim believes they gave virtuoso {genre: prog rock} performances. He chooses not to go with one of Rush's epic songs, which could take up half a show, and instead picks a track called "{track: Trees}." This song, released on the band's {era: 1978} album {album: Hemispheres}, tells the story of a battle of the wills between maple trees and oak trees. If that doesn't convince you of the band's greatness, listen for drummer {name: Neal Peart}'s woodblock solo!
