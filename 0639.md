![Don Was](https://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2018/don_was.jpg)

{artist: Don Was} is a bassist in the band {artist: Was (Not Was)}, a successful music producer for artists like {artist: The Rolling Stones} and {artist: Bob Dylan}, and the president of legendary {genre: jazz} label {label: Blue Note Records}. This week, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} pick the brain of the multi-talented Don Was about his influences, what he looks for in an artist and what he loves about music. Plus, Jim and Greg review new albums from {genre: indie rock} band {artist: Superchunk} and {genre: rap}per {artist: Dessa}.


## 00:01:31 Review: Superchunk
![What a Time to Be Alive](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music118/v4/f5/f8/db/f5f8db95-3cbf-8670-b2dc-18bc56ab7bcb/source/600x600bb.jpg "3647724/1298680293")
{artist: Superchunk} has returned with their 11th album, {album: What a Time to be Alive}. According to Greg, in recent years the {place: North Carolina} {genre: indie rock}ers tend to put out work only when they have a purpose behind it. Jim and Greg both believe this album strikes a particularly insistent {tag: political} tone. In fact, Greg adds that the album "just roars." He's never heard singer/guitarist {artist: Mac McCaughan} sound so worked up, and adds that with tracks like "{track: Reagan Youth}" Superchunk "return the favor" to groups like {artist: Reagan Youth} that inspired them back in the {era: 1980s.} Jim says that in times of crisis, music helps motivate people. He thinks that songs like "{track: Break the Glass}" fuel that motivation. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} give the record a double {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:09:20 Review: Dessa
![Chime](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/71/4d/d2/714dd281-f653-6571-9cfd-8ae60c607b1a/source/600x600bb.jpg "281439497/1322884136")
{album: Chime} is {artist: Dessa}'s fourth full-length album, and the singer/{genre: rap}per/philosopher has given us an album that is according to Jim "brilliant," even name-checking St. Thomas Aquinas. Greg notes that the record explores how "women measure their lives today" in a world where getting through the day without incident is a win; and suggests that she's saying "we need to have a better world than this." He praises the creative production, whether it's a {tag: sitar} sample (in "{track: Fire Drills}") or a {genre: chamber pop} {tag: cello} solo (in "{track: Velodrome}.") Greg thinks Dessa's {genre: pop} vocals are less unique, but concedes that they provide a "good counterbalance" to heavier themes. Jim says the record balances "self-empowerment and sensitivity." Chime gets a Double {tag: Buy It} from {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}.
