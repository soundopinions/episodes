# Show 467: Broken Bells 
![brokenbells_web](http://static.soundopinions.org/images/2014/brokenbells_web.jpg)

{artist: The Shins} frontman {name: James Mercer} and super-producer {name: Danger Mouse} are the celestial {genre: rock} duo {artist: Broken Bells}. The pair joins Sound Opinions in {place: Portland}, {place: Oregon} for a special live performance and conversation.  

## 00:02:06 News: 11.7.14

While {artist: Taylor Swift} fans may think she made history way back in {era: 1989} by simply being born, the charts will remember Swift for the year {era: 2014}, as it marks the first time in twelve years that an artist's album has sold more than one million copies in its debut week. This feat, achieved by Swift's fifth studio album {album: 1989}, is no small one given our age of {tag: streaming music} services and record leaks. That's why the secret to Swift's physical album sales success might just be her recent decision to pull all her music off of streaming music supergiant {tag: Spotify}. Swift now joins a growing chorus of musicians like {artist: Radiohead}'s {artist: Thom Yorke} who reject Spotify's business model, one that only pays artists a fraction of a penny for each stream of their songs. Spotify, of course, defends its model, but Swift stands by her assertion that music is art, art is valuable and therefore it should be paid for. And yes, by art she means "{track: Shake It Off}."

On the opposite end of the commercial spectrum from superstar {artist: Taylor Swift} is the self-described  "Liberian/Nigerian/Scottish psychedelic hip-hop electro boy band,"  {artist: Young Fathers}. Despite the {genre: alternative hip-hop} group's relative obscurity, its album, {album: Dead}, just won the {place: UK}'s {tag: Mercury Prize}, an annual honor given to the best British or Irish album of the year. The win was an upset for more buzzed about artists like {artist: FKA Twigs} and {artist: Damon Albarn}, and many criticize the award for favoring obscure bands that are never heard from again. To be fair, well-known and still active acts like {artist: PJ Harvey}, {artist: Franz Ferdinand} and {artist: Arctic Monkeys} have taken the prize home in the past, but whether Young Fathers have staying power or not remains to be seen.

## 00:06:46 Interview: Broken Bells
{name: James Mercer} of {artist: The Shins} and {name: Brian Burton} ({name: Danger Mouse}) formed a band called {artist: Broken Bells} that combines Mercer's songwriting abilities with Burton's incredible production techniques. The duo has released two albums under that moniker and the project has two fans in {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}. The band met at the {place: Roskilde Festival} in {place: Denmark} have continued to work together on-and-off since. Brian talks about their songwriting process which essentially boils down to late night chats about everything under the sun, and then putting those ideas to music in the studio. James describes how Brian pushed him as a singer--making him do take after take until he got it right. Broken Bells' newest album As {host: Greg} notes, {album: After the Disco} is evocative of that 3 a.m. feeling when things "wear off." The band joined Jim and Greg for a special performance at the historic {name: Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall} in {place: Portland, OR}. The crowd was courtesy of our friends at [**{tag: opbmusic}**](http://www.opb.org/opbmusic/) 


## 00:49:55 DIJ: Jim
{artist: Cream} {tag: bassist} {artist: Jack Bruce} recently passed away at age of 71, and as Jim explains, he played an important part in the {era: '60s} English music scene. Bruce had a long career as an underground musician playing {genre: jazz}, {genre: rock} and {genre: avant-garde} music. To pay homage to him, {host: Jim} chose a song for the {tag: Desert Island Juxebox} that was actually not from his time with Cream. Instead, he goes with "{track: Silver Bullet}" by the {artist: Golden Palominos}. Jim had the pleasure of seeing the larger-than-live Bruce perform this track live, and he'll never forget it.
