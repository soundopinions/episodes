## 00:07:59 Interview: Torres
{place: Georgia}-born musician {name: Mackenzie Scott} emerged out of the {place: Nashville} scene in 2013 with a critically-lauded debut under the moniker {artist: Torres}. Her {era: 2015} followup {album: *Sprinter*}, recorded with {artist: PJ Harvey} collaborator {name: Rob Ellis}, has earned even more acclaim, including a spot in {host: Greg}'s [Best of 2015 (So Far)](http://soundopinions.org/show/498) list. Torres joined {host: Jim} and Greg in the studio to discuss her emotionally charged and unconventional songwriting. She became devoted to music early on, idolizing {artist: Taylor Swift} as a teen and then earning a college degree in songwriting. Her songs are both intensely personal and also sung behind the guise of characters, drawing inspiration from varied sources like the {tag: Old Testament} and {name: J.D. Salinger}. Torres explains how music allows her to confront feelings about her childhood when other methods of communication have failed.

{album: *Wild Heart*} is the third studio album from cutting edge {genre: R&B} singer and songwriter Miguel. {artist: Miguel} who is of both Mexican American and African American heritages, has always had a different approach to the {genre: R&B} genre. While his first album was tinkered with by A&R folks, his last record was his coming-out party; displaying his affection for multiple genres and subject matter of an adult variety. On this third album, *Wild Heart*, {artist: Miguel} continues his exploration into genre and sexuality. {host: Jim} thinks he comes from the school of thought of {artist: Marvin Gaye} and {artist: D'Angelo}, artists whose avant garde nature scared traditionalists. He gives this album a {tag: Buy It} rating. {host: Greg} agrees and says the orchestration and the honest lyrics make this album one of his favorites of the year. He gives it a {tag: Buy It} as well.
