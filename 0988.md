## 00:00:00 Review: Alan Sparhawk
 
For more than 30 years {artist : Alan Sparhawk}’s primary artistic outlet was the band Low, with his spouse Mimi Parker. Parker died in 2022, effectively ending Low as an active project. “{album : White Roses, My God}” is Sparhawk’s second solo album, and goes even further into electronic sounds than Low’s last few records.
