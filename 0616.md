![Late Bloomers](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2017/latebloomers_web.jpg)

Some say that making music is a young person's game, but several artists beg to differ. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} share some of their favorite "late blooming" musicians â€“ artists that didn't achieve success or even start music until later in life. Plus, a review of the debut album from rock {tag: supergroup} {artist: Filthy Friends} and a {tag: Hooked on Sonics} from Swedish {genre: electronic} band {artist: Little Dragon}.


## 00:02:05 Review: Filthy Friends
![Invitation](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/616/3H0.jpg)
The {genre: indie rock} {tag: supergroup} {artist: Filthy Friends} initially formed in 2012 as a cover band. Led by {artist: Sleater-Kinney}'s {name: Corin Tucker} and {artist: R.E.M.}'s {name: Peter Buck}, along with {name: Kurt Bloch}, {name: Scott McCaughey}, and {name: Bill Rieflin}, the group has released its debut album of originals, {album: Invitation}. {host: Jim} is skeptical of all supergroups, but thinks that Filthy Friends gels as a real band. He finds the guitar interplay to be a joy and loves the little allusions the band makes to their musical heroes. Jim calls {album: Invitation} a fun ride worthy of a {tag: Buy It}. {host: Greg}, however, finds the album to be a tentative effort. Tucker's vocals are uncharacteristically restrained, he says, and the record lacks any musical surprises. According to Greg, the album is pleasant enough, but he can't imagine listening to it a year from now, so all he can give it is a {tag: Try It}.


## 00:08:36 List: Late Bloomers

It's not where you start, it's where you finish! {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} are showing their love for the {tag: late bloomers} of music - artists who either didn't achieve success or even start their careers until later in life.

## 00:46:10 Feature: Hooked On Sonics: Little Dragon
![Little Dragon](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/616/24Y0.jpg)
{place: Swed[en]}ish band {artist: Little Dragon} has been churning out catchy electronic soul since 2006; but their connection to soul music started much earlier. Lead vocalist {name: Yukimi Nagano} and drummer {name: Erik Bodin} told us about the song that helped Yukimi to embrace her own unique voice in the latest edition of {tag: Hooked on Sonics}. A fan of American {genre: soul} music, it was the voice of {name: Aaron Neville} of {artist: The Neville Brothers} singing {artist: Sam Cooke}'s "{track: A Change is Gonna Come}" that blew her mind.


## 00:50:57 DIJ: Jim
This week's {tag: Desert Island Jukebox} pick is an earworm that just might get stuck in your head. That's because  {artist: Nikki Sudden} & {artist: Dave Kusworth} of the British band {artist: Jacobites} crafted one of Jim's favorite pop songs ever with their 1984's {track: Shame For The Angels}. A song about unrequited love, Shame For The Angels might not be on your radar, but {host: Jim} thinks it ought to be.
