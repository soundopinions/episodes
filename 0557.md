![Tortoise](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2016/tortoise_web.jpg)

With an eclectic all-instrumental blend of {genre: rock}, {genre: jazz}, {genre: dub}, {genre: electronics}, and the {genre: avant-garde}, {artist: Tortoise} emerged as the leading band of {place: Chicago}'s so-called "{genre: post-rock}" scene in the {era: 1990s}. On its seventh album {album: The Catastrophist}, the group has introduced a radical new element: vocals. Tortoise joins {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} for a conversation and performance. Jim and Greg also explore the history and legacy of the post-rock movement. Plus, a tribute to {name: Alan Vega} of {artist: Suicide} and a review of the new album from {place: British} {genre: soul} musician {artist: Michael Kiwanuka}.

## 00:01:45 Genre Dissection: Post-Rock

With {artist: Tortoise} joining them in the studio this week, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} take a moment to give a primer on the {genre: post-rock} movement. Like virtually all genre labels, "post-rock" is a term rejected by most of the artists associated with it. It generally refers to a set of mostly instrumental bands in the {era: 1990s} who used non-traditional instrumentation and a collage-like approach to blending genres. Jim and Greg trace the origins of the movement to {place: German} {genre: krautrock}, experimental {era: '60s} {genre: jazz-rock} bands, and {genre: dub reggae}. There were major post-rock acts across the globe, including in the {place: UK} ({artist: Stereolab}), {place: Montreal} ({artist: Godspeed You! Black Emperor}), and especially in {place: Chicago}. From Tortoise to {artist: Gastr Del Sol} to {artist: The Denison/Kimball Trio}, Chicago's scene fostered an eclectic experimentation with styles.

## 00:10:28 Interview: Tortoise
By the late {era: '90s}, {artist: Tortoise} became the leading band of not only the {place: Chicago} scene, but the global {genre: post-rock} movement. The all-instrumental band was founded by {name: Doug McCombs} and {name: John Herndon} as a bass and drums duo in the late '80s, inspired by {place: Jamaica}n rhythm-section-for-hire {artist: Sly and Robbie}. Eventually the band came to include {name: John McEntire}, {name: Dan Bitney}, and {genre: jazz} guitarist {name: Jeff Parker}. Tortoise received massive critical acclaim for the 1996 album {album: Millions Now Living Will Never Die} and 1998's {album: TNT}. On the latest record {album: The Catastrophist}, the band experiments with the strangest innovation of all: vocals. Tortoise joins {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} for a conversation and live performance.

## 00:45:14 Special: Remembering Alan Vega
![Alan Vega](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/557/23E0.jpg)
This week {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} pay tribute to {name: Alan Vega}, former singer for electronic {genre: protopunk} band {artist: Suicide}. Jim discusses the importance of Suicide in transforming the conception of the {tag: synthesizer} from suitable for use solely in melodic or dance music into an abrasive instrument. Suicide's music often warranted extreme hate from crowds of listeners, and their aggressive {genre: electronic} music helped pave the way for {genre: punk} music. Suicide was widely influential and beloved by many artists –even  {artist: Bruce Springsteen} has been covering the band's music. Vega passed away on July 16 at the age of 78. 

## 00:50:11 Review: Michael Kiwanuka
![Love & Hate](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/557/2BN0.jpg)

British {genre: soul} artist {artist: Michael Kiwanuka} first came to public attention after opening for {artist: Adele} in {era: 2011}. Five years later, he's released his second album called {album: Love and Hate}. While his first record had a vibe that resembled classic {genre: soul folk} artists like {artist: Bill Withers}, he went in a different direction the second time around. {host: Greg} loves Kiwanuka's sophomore effort because of his departure from his initial style. He thinks that Kiwanuka has found his voice as an artist, speaking out about his experiences as a "{track: black man in a white world}" as he sings in a track with the same name. Greg thought his collaboration with {name: Danger Mouse} really elevated his music to another level, he gives this album a {tag: Buy It}. {host: Jim} also thought very highly of *Love & Hate*. He admires his willingness to speak openly about issues he is passionate about, and appreciates Kiwanuka's melding of different genres. Jim also gives the album an enthusiastic {tag: Buy It}.
