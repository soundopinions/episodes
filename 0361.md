## 00:49:09 Review: Converge
![All We Love We Leave Behind (Deluxe Edition)](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/55/4e/a1/554ea1f0-f4e0-910a-6151-5258c26cd5e3/source/600x600bb.jpg "15405383/566635636")

How could we not end the Halloween special with a band from {place: Salem, Massachusetts}? {genre: Metal} group {artist: Converge} has a new album out called {album: All We Love We Leave Behind}, and it continues their successful two-decade run. Converge is often referred to as "smart metal," but {host: Jim} thinks "ambitious metal" is more apt. This especially applies to the drummer's range of almost jazzy 
rhythms. {host: Greg} says few bands combine aggression with virtuosity better than Converge. The soundscapes are dreamlike and the guitar bursts mind-boggling. *All We Love We Leave Behind* gets two {tag: Buy It} ratings.
