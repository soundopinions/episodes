## 00:01:44 News: 11.18.2011
One of the biggest sales in record company history has just been completed. {label: EMI}, until now one of the four remaining major labels, is being broken up and sold off by the megabank {tag: Citigroup} for a combined $4.1 billion. After many months of negotiations, French media company {tag: Vivendi}, which owns {label: Universal Music Group}, will buy EMI's recorded music division and {tag: Sony Corp}. will pick up the publishing arm. Now we're down to three. But some people speculate that consolidation is necessary for this industry's survival. One thing is certain, Universal, already the largest music company in the world, with an estimated 27% of the global market, is now an even bigger giant with the addition of {artist: Coldplay}, {artist: Katy Perry} and {artist: Pink Floyd} to its roster. 

It may be years too late, but {tag: Google} is finally in the digital music business. They launched their {tag: online store} with a splash on Wednesday, demonstrating how its 13 million songs will be integrated with {tag: Android} and can be accessed across various devices and shared with friends. The {tag: Internet company} inked licensing deals with 2 of the 3 labels, save Warner Music Group, but it seems unlikely Google be able to compete with reigning digital music king {tag: iTunes}, as well as services from {tag: Amazon} and {tag: Spotify}. The secret to success rests with its dominant search engine. People will come to {tag: Google Music} first. But will they stay is the real question.

## 00:07:13 List: Turkey Shoot
Time to round up the turkeys! Jim and Greg name this year's most disappointing albums as part of their {tag: Thanksgiving Turkey Shoot}. These aren't just bad records, but ones that should have been so much better. Here are the Butterballs and Tofurkeys for {tag: 2011}:

## 00:43:23 Review: Drake 
![Take Care (Deluxe Version)](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/a3/5d/af/a35dafc5-a190-2f00-1744-a20271a18152/source/600x600bb.jpg "271256/479756751")

Is the new album by rapper {artist: Drake} another contender for the Turkey Shoot? According to Jim, yes. He really enjoyed the former Degrassi star's debut in 2010. But on {album: Take Care}, Jim just hears a young man whining about his wealth and fame. And worse, that whining stays in the same tempo for 17 tracks. {host: Jim} says {tag: Trash It}. Greg had a completely different reaction. He thinks this sophomore effort is an improvement and doesn't hear whining as much as an honest depiction of what happens when fame shatters your moral compass. {host: Greg} also appreciates the way Drake blurs the lines between {genre: hip-hop} and {genre: R&B}. This host would encourage you to {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:50:41 DIJ: Greg
The {tag: Desert Island Jukebox} segment is often an opportunity to give love to an artist who doesn't get enough of it. Prime example? {artist: Earth, Wind and Fire}. Sure we've all heard the hits at weddings. But brothers Verdine and Maurice White were musical geniuses in Greg's opinion. And one of their strengths was linking the {genre: funk} of the {era: 1970's} to its roots in {place: Africa}. They did this through dress, but also through the use of instruments like the {tag: Kalimba}. Check out the rhythms in Greg's choice of the week, "{track: Kalimba Story}."
