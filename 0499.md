# Show 499: The Life and Music of BB King & Opinions on Richard Thompson

![BB King](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2015/bbking_web.jpg)

International blues ambassador {artist: B.B. King} passed away in May. Jim and Greg celebrate the life and music of the great guitarist with a classic album dissection of {album: Live at the Regal}.


## 00:02:23 News: 06.19.15
Jim and Greg kick off the show by celebrating the life of another great artist: {tag: saxophonist} and {genre: free jazz} pioneer {artist: Ornette Coleman}, dead at the age of 85. While critics sometimes loosely toss around phrases about musicians changing music, in this case, it is an undisputed truth. Coleman forever set {genre: jazz} on an entirely new path, with an influence spreading into the world of {genre: rock}, as well. Artists like {artist: Patti Smith}, {artist: The Velvet Underground}, and {artist: Sonic Youth} all stood in the shadow of Coleman's innovations. He developed a musical philosophy he called "{tag: harmolodics}," which set aside the traditional approach of adhering to chord changes and instead created intricately layered melodies that favored each instrument equally. Though sometimes dismissed as dissonant noise, {host: Greg} contends that Coleman had one of the greatest ears for melody in music. As an example of Ornette's unique approach to ensemble playing, Greg plays "{track: Jump Street}" from Ornette Coleman's 1979 album {album: Of Human Feelings}.

## 00:07:42 Classic Album Dissection: Live at the Regal
![Live At the Regal](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/pf/us/r30/Music6/v4/9c/b1/81/9cb18113-c3db-e421-9b75-049cfc45c9f5/dj.lkbzexuh.600x600-75.jpg "75207/62772")
{artist: B.B. King} was the face of the {genre: blues} for much of the world. Sadly, we'll never get to hear him play his trusty {tag: guitar} {tag: Lucille} again. He passed away on May 14, 2015 at age 89. To honor the late great bluesman, we're offering a {tag: Classic Album Dissection} of his {album: Live at the Regal} {tag: concert album}, recorded in {place: Chicago}'s {place: Bronzeville} neighborhood in {era: 1964}. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} are joined by photographer, writer, promoter and {tag: Blues Hall of Fame} inductee {name: Dick Waterman}. Waterman was a long-time friend of B.B.'s and co-author of *{tag: The B.B. King Treasures}*. He explains that while King was pleased that *Live at the Regal* achieved iconic status, he didn't think there was anything special about his performance that night. Had they taped any other show around that time, the results would have been much the same. Still, the masterful control that B.B. had over his raucous crowd that evening became legendary. For Jim, the album resembles a celebratory church service more than any depressing blues stereotype. 

If B.B. King's on-stage persona is that of a humble, genial man, that's because he truly was one in real life. According to Waterman, B.B. devoted hours after each show to meeting with his fans as a show of appreciation for their contribution to his success. Even after the mainstream commercial success of "{track:The Thrill is Gone}," he always stayed true to his vision, never watering it down for his new white audience. He was one of the last of his generation of blues artists, but his legacy is going to live on.

## 00:42:24 Review: Richard Thompson
![Still](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/pf/us/r30/Music7/v4/b8/a4/06/b8a40644-ceac-ba04-4734-793921755665/UMG_cvrart_00888072372771_01_RGB72_1500x1500_14CMGIM01805.600x600-75.jpg "264023/986229457")
{album: Still} is the 25th solo album from {genre: folk rock} guitarist, {artist: Richard Thompson}. The former {artist: Fairport Convention} musician collaborated with {artist: Wilco} frontman and producer {name: Jeff Tweedy}. {host: Greg} wasn't exactly disappointed, but a little let down after Thompson's ferocious {era: 2013} album, {album: Electric}. In *Still*, he explores some darker and more serious themes like loss of faith in humanity. However Greg was happy he balanced those tracks with lighter and more humorous songs like "{track: Guitar Heroes.}" He gives it a {tag: Buy It}. {host: Jim} actually found "Guitar Heroes" cheesy. He also doesn't think Tweedy added much in his production. But because of wins like "{track: Josephine}" and "{track: Long John Silver}," Jim says {tag: Buy It}. 

## 00:50:57 DIJ: Jim
Recently {host: Jim} re-watched {name: David Lynch}'s {era: '90s} {tag: supernatural} TV show {tag: *Twin Peaks*}. The program uniquely incorporated music to complement its twisted murder-mystery storyline. {tag: Singer-songwriter} {artist: Julee Cruise} frequently offered her vocals to the show's soundtrack and collaborated with producer Lynch and composer {artist: Angelo Badalamenti} on her debut album {album: Floating into the Night}. The single "{track: Falling}," featuring Lynch's haunting lyrics and Badalamenti's dark composition, was used as the theme song for *Twin Peaks* throughout its run and remains one of Jim's favorite tracks.
