## 00:02:32 Review: tUnE-yArDs

![tuneyards](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2025/tuneyards.jpg)

{artist : Tune-Yards}' sixth studio album “{album : Better Dreaming}” is the first since duo Merrill Garbus and Nate Brenner became parents. The hosts agree that it may be Tune-Yards' most danceable album yet.



## 00:09:49 Review: Pelican

{artist : Pelican}'s mostly instrumental metal music is in fine form on their seventh album “{album : Flickering Resonance}.” It is a return to a two guitar approach with touches of space rock and ambient vibes.



## 00:18:12 Review: Shamir

{artist : Shamir} has declared that the new album, “{album : Ten},” is his last. In the ten years since his debut album, “Ratchet,” Shamir Bailey has focused primarily on electronic music, but this features live instrumentation. Host Jim DeRogatis theorizes that post-COVID many people are having mid-life crisis at age 30 and hope Shamir will find a way to continue making music.  



## 00:00:00 Interview: Jill Sobule

{artist : Jill Sobule} tragically died in a house fire on May 1 at age 66. The singer-songwriter had a few hit singles in the 1990s, then pioneered a more direct relationship with her fans, performing house concerts and crowdfunding recording sessions. In 2009, she and Julia Sweeney of Saturday Night Live recorded a session for Sound Opinions, which we revisit this week.
