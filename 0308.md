# Show 308: Cut Copy & Björk Review
The Australian electronic pop band {artist: Cut Copy} performs live in the studio.

## 00:01:44 News: 10.21.2011
{tag: Amazon} recently announced its move into the {tag: publishing} world. Authors like {tag: *Laverne and Shirley*}'s {name: Penny Marshall} have inked deals to have their books published and distributed by the online retailer. These kind of deals are similar to the exclusive releases sold by music retailers like {tag: Wal-Mart} and {tag: Starbucks}. So it begs the question: Is Amazon the music label next?

Longtime {genre: soul} musician {artist: Syl Johnson}'s songs have been sampled by countless other artists. And consequently he's turned into a "{tag: serial litigator}" according to {host: Greg}. The latest people to face his legal wrath: {artist: Kanye West} and {artist: Jay-Z}. The {genre: hip-hop} stars used a sample of Johnson's track "{track: Different Strokes}" in their song "{track: The Joy}" from {album: Watch the Throne}. And now Johnson is seeking an injunction, damages and legal fees. 

In other music news, {artist: Stone Roses} fans will be happy to learn that the {place: Manchester} band will hit the stage for the first time in 15 years. Greg compares the group to the {artist: Oasis} of its time, but wonders if they'll still have the chops. After all, The Stone Roses split after a disastrous show at the {place: Reading Festival} in {tag: 1996}.

## 00:06:58 Interview: Cut Copy
Next up Jim and Greg are visited by members of the {place: Australian} quartet {artist: Cut Copy}. The group merges classic {genre: pop} sounds with {genre: electronic} dance beats, but began as just a bedroom project for former graphic designer and {tag: DJ} {name: Dan Whitford}. He added guitars, drums and keyboards to the mix, and the result is a live instrumentation that rivals the production you'll hear on record. Cut Copy performs songs from their recent album {album: Zonoscope}, which packs in hooks and a sheen that harkens back to '70s pop radio. Check out [video](http://www.wbez.org/story/cut-copy-performs-wbez-studios-sound-opinions-93332) of the band in the studio.

## 00:44:47 Review: Björk
![Biophilia](http://betaisbetter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/bjork-biophilia.jpg "295015/468271934")
{artist: Björk} is always ambitious. And on her latest release {album: Biophilia}, she releases her {tag: iPad} compositions as a full-blown {tag: multimedia project} with {tag: apps} and {tag: animation}. You have to admire it, but the music is something else for {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}. She employs custom instruments and unconventional rhythms and time-signatures, but nothing comes out very coherent or melodic. It's robotic and lacks emotion, and Jim and Greg say {tag: Trash It}.

## 00:51:12 DIJ: Greg
It's Greg's turn to drop a song in the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}, and he chooses to honor {artist: Bert Jansch} who died recently at age 67. The Scottish folk guitarist can count Neil Young and Jimmy Page among his followers, and his east meets west sound continues to be an influence for a new generation of folk artists such as Beth Orton and Devendra Banhart. Greg chooses the tune "{track: When the Sun Comes Up}," featuring Orton from his 2006 release {album: Black Swan}.
