## 00:02:09 Intro: Music News
Over the years a number of politicians have butted heads with rockers over the use of {tag: music} in {tag: campaign ads}. Not surprisingly most of the squabbles have been with {tag: Republican} candidates. But this most recent lawsuit between {artist: Talking Heads} singer {name: David Byrne} and former {place: Florida} {tag: Governor} {name: Charlie Crist} has a new twist. Not only did Crist have to [apologize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4k13LmlcUE) for using "{track: Road to Nowhere}" without permission, but he had to do it on {tag: YouTube}!

## 00:05:13 Interview: Drive-By Truckers
The term "{genre: Southern rock}" brings images of long hair, confederate flags and {artist: Lynyrd Skynyrd} to mind. But when it comes to the {artist: Drive-By Truckers}, you have to push that all aside. {name: Patterson Hood}, son of {artist: Muscle Shoals } {tag: bassist} {name: David Hood}, and {name: Mike Cooley} formed the group in {place: Athens, GA} in {era: 1996}, and since then they've consistently toured, recorded and pushed the envelope of Southern sound. In {era: 2001} people took notice with {album: Southern Rock Opera}. Now three members of the band, Hood, {name: Jay Gonzalez} and {name: Shonna Tucker}, stop by the studio to perform new tracks from {album: Go-Go Boots}, as well as an {artist: Eddie Hinton} {tag: cover}. 

## 00:42:54 Review: Gorillaz
![The Fall](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/282/1ZI0.jpg)
{artist: Gorillaz}, the {tag: animated act} fronted by {name: Damon Albarn} of {artist: Blur}, has a new album out called {album: The Fall}. The title is both a reference to the band and also to the fact that this might be their last album. Albarn {tag: recorded} the songs on his {tag: iPad} while traveling on the last tour. Therefore, it's lower-key with fewer guest stars. {host: Jim} appreciates this quiet, ambient sound. It's a little sleepy at points, but he says {tag: Buy It}. {host: Greg} admires the modest, headphone quality of the record, but defines this as a "must-own" only for hardcore fans. For the rest of you, he says, {tag: Burn It}.

## 00:48:40 DIJ: Jim
Jim noted that 20 years ago on April 23, 1991, {artist: Johnny Thunders} died. The former {artist: New York Doll[s]} sadly became as famous for his bad heroin habit as he was for his music. So, Jim uses his turn at the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox} to remember the music. He plays a song about addiction, "{track: Chinese Rocks}," which was written by fellow {genre: punk} legends {artist: Dee Dee Ramone} and {artist: Richard Hell}, and performed by Thunders and his band {artist: The Heartbreakers} in {era: 1977}.
