# Show 452: Rosanne Cash & Opinions on Jenny Lewis
![Rosannecash](http://static.soundopinions.org/images/2014/Rosannecash2.jpg)

{genre: Singer-songwriter} {artist: Rosanne Cash} performs songs from her recent album {album: The River & the Thread} and talks about carrying on her family's legacy and why there's no love lost between her and {genre: country} music. This interview was recorded in front of an audience at {tag: WXPN} in {place: Philadelphia}. Later {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} review the new release from another singer-songwriter, {artist: Jenny Lewis}.

## 00:02:13 News: 7.25.14
A sad music headline kicks off this episode. {place: Texas} {genre: Blues} {tag: guitar}ist {artist: Johnny Winter} died last week at age 70. Greg notes that it's significant that Winter died while on tour in {place: Europe}, as he kept on working until the very end. And he encouraged his heroes to do the same. Winter, who had hits with his brother {artist: Edgar [Winter]} and with singer {artist: Rick Derringer} in the {era: 1970's}, produced three late-career albums for Blues legend {artist: Muddy Waters}. You can literally [hear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgaxYEsEVVY) Winter's stamp on songs like {track: "Mannish Boy"} from {era: 1977}'s {album: Hard Again}.

## 00:05:27 Interview: Rosanne Cash
Considering that {artist: Rosanne Cash} was born into music royalty, she's a veteran of the business. But that hasn't stopped her from blazing her own trail. The eldest daughter of {artist: Johnny Cash}, Rosanne, too, is something of a maverick, never fitting into any proper "{genre: Country}" or "{genre: Rock}" cagetories. She eschewed the binding confines of {place: Nashville} for {place: New York City}, where she lives with husband and musical partner {artist: John Leventhal}. Rosanne recently released her 13th studio album, {album: The River and the Thread}, and she joined us for a special live performance at the {place: WXPN} studios in {place: Philadelphia}. She talked with {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} about her father's legacy, working with her husband, breaking away from the {place: Nashville} industrial complex, and how she can write a beautiful song based on a tweet. 

## 00:49:17 Review: Jenny Lewis
![The Voyager](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music5/v4/73/4b/38/734b380c-eeb0-68f8-662d-8dd2baed70a8/dj.yavqkbgv.jpg/600x600bb-85.jpg "117038088/883276305")

It has been 6 years since {place: California} {genre: folk}-{genre: rock} siren {artist: Jenny Lewis} released her last solo album, and {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} have been chomping at the bit to see what her most recent release has to offer. The former child actress turned indie songstress lived through some turbulent stresses during that time, including the death of her estranged father, a bout of insomnia and the break-up of her band, the power pop group {artist: Rilo Kiley}. All of this made its way onto {album: The Voyager}, a slow syrupy overflow of calming soundscape reminiscent of {place: California}'s late {era: 60's}/early {era: 70's} {genre: Laurel Canyon} sound. Greg was taken by its deceptive smoothness. His only critique points toward the balmy sweetness of the music. However, that sound provides a great foil to the complicated lyrics. He says {tag: Buy It}. Jim agrees, though he's less of a fan of Lewis' obvious inspiration (Fleetwood Mac to name one). But, he describes the album as brave and seconds the {tag: Buy It}.
