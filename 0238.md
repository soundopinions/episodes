## 00:01:45 List: Guilty Pleasures

Everyone has a cheesy pop skeleton in his or her musical closet–even rock critics. This week {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} fess up and reveal their musical {tag : Guilty Pleasures}. These are songs that our hosts know are not "cool" or "artistic," but for whatever reason, they love 'em. And at Sound Opinions we have a completely populist philosophy about music. If it's got a good beat, and you can dance to it, enjoy it.

Here are Jim and Greg's Guilty Pleasures:


### Jim

- {artist : Everlast}, "{track : Saving Grace}"
- {artist : P.M. Dawn}, "{track : Downtown Venus}"
- {artist : Ted Nugent}, "{track : Good Friends and a Bottle of Wine}"


### Greg

- {artist : John Fred And His Playboy Band}, "{track : Judy in Disguise (With Glasses)}"
- {artist : Sweet}, "{track : Blockbuster}"
- {artist : The Moody Blues}, "{track : Late Lament}"


### Listeners

Jim and Greg didn't want to be alone in confessions. They invited some listeners to come clean as well:

- Alec from New Orleans, {artist : Captain and Tennille}, "{track : Love Will Keep Us Together}"
- Liana from Portland, "{track : Part of Your World}" from {album : The Little Mermaid}
- Dan from Philadelphia, {artist : Cyndi Lauper}, "{track : Girls Just Wanna Have Fun}"
- Brady from Concord, NH, {artist : Richard Harris}, "{track : MacArthur Park}"



## 00:40:30 Review: Tom Petty

![Mojo](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/238/1VI0.jpg)

In his four decades in music, {name : Tom Petty} has appeared to do it all. He's been inducted into the {tag : Rock and Roll Hall of Fame}, he's performed at the {tag : Superbowl}, and he's collaborated with everyone from {artist : George Harrison} to {artist : Johnny Cash}. So, {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} wonder, what's left to accomplish? On his new album {album : Mojo}, it sounds like the only goal was to have an easygoing jam. That's not a bad thing, necessarily, but Jim feels like the fight has gone out of Petty. Greg agrees, explaining that Mojo is more about the band's performances and the songs themselves. Both critics give {artist : Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers} a {tag : Try It} rating.



## 00:47:25 Review: Rhymefest

![El Che](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/238/2710.jpg)

After years battling with his major label {label : J Records}, rapper {artist : Rhymefest} has finally released an album on his own. {album : El Che} is his second official release, though he put out a fascinating (and unauthorized) Michael Jackson tribute in 2008. As Greg explains, this record definitely doesn't fit in a major label model–it's too hard to market as one thing. It's funny, political and poppy. But, because of that, the sound of El Che is sometimes erratic and not as strong as his debut. {host : Greg} gives the record a {tag : Try It}. {host : Jim} disagrees. He hasn't seen this kind of strength of character in hip hop in a long time. Rhymefest is indeed weird, but he's funny, unique and totally himself. Jim gives El Che a {tag : Buy It}.
