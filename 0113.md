## 00:01:45 News: 01.25.08
{artist: The Rolling Stones} made headlines this week after inking an exclusive recording deal with {label: Universal Music}. This has prompted speculation that the Stones are planning to leave longtime label {label: EMI}, which is restructuring under new ownership. This would be one of many big name acts rumored to be headed for the hills, including {artist: Coldplay} and {artist: Robbie Williams}. {artist: Paul McCartney} and {artist: Radiohead} have already fled, and the potential loss of the Stones catalog could cost EMI over $6 million. New CEO {name: Guy Hands} refuses to express concern, but Jim and Greg predict that the music industry may come down from the six major labels it had at the turn of the century, to only three.

Singer/songwriter {name: John Stewart} passed away earlier this week at the age of 68. Stewart penned {artist: The Monkees}' classic tune "{track: Daydream Believer}," but many listeners may not know about the huge song catalog he left behind. He recorded nearly four dozen solo albums and helped to create what we now know as "{genre: Americana}." In addition to influencing artists like {artist: Lucinda Williams}, {artist: Steve Earle} and {artist: Roseanne Cash}, he was idolized by {name: Lindsey Buckingham}, the {artist: Fleetwood Mac} member who teamed up with him and {name: Stevie Nicks} for Stewart's hit single "{track: Gold}."

## 00:06:31 Interview: Anthony Bourdain
Many people know {name: Anthony Bourdain} from his many books, his TV show "{tag: No Reservations}", and his successful restaurant {tag: Les Halles}. But, you may not know that he's a die-hard rock and roll fan. Bourdain recently chronicled his punk past in the Spin essay "Eat to the Beat," and when he was in town on a book tour, Jim and Greg invited him into the studio to talk turkey (and {genre: rock}).

Anthony, or Tony as he likes to be called, explained to Jim and Greg that there are a lot of connections between members of the food world and the music world, the first of which is simply the hours. Both subcultures are nocturnal pleasure-seekers who often frequent the same greasy spoons and the same dive bars. But on a more cerebral level, music geeks and foodies are both obsessed, both opinionated, and both hate {artist: Billy Joel}. Tony explains that when he's serving up grub to guests he prefers the tunes of {artist: Edith Piaf}, {artist: Serge Gainsbourg}, and even {artist: Connie Francis}. 

## 00:29:55 Special: Culinary Music

- {name: Wesley Genovart} of {tag: Degustation} in {place: New York}

- {name: Craig Serbousek} of {tag: Crow and Bette} in {place: Seattle}
- {name: Graham Elliot Bowles} of {tag: Avenues} in {place: Chicago}

To cap off this show, Jim and Greg run through their favorite culinary-inspired songs. All of them are either about food, inspired by {tag: food}, or simply name foods, and all of them certainly rock.
