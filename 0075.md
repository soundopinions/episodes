# Show 75: Summer 2007 Review Roundup
With every new album comes another opportunity for Jim and Greg to head to head. Tune in this week as they debate the merits of new releases from Björk, Mavis Staples, and the Arctic Monkeys, plus many more.

## 00:01:45 Review: Feist
![Let It Die](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/00/ee/d2/00eed223-d2c1-2da6-c59a-4697b6238a84/source/600x600bb.jpg "13453308/278765960")
{artist: Feist} has the first album up for review this week. {name: Leslie Feist} has performed with {artist: Broken Social Scene} and {artist: Peaches}, and broke out as a solo artist with her 2004 album {album: Let It Die}. {album: The Reminder} marks the Canadian's move to {place: Paris}, and is another collection of romantic, intimate {genre: cabaret} songs. {host: Jim} compares Feist's music to that of {artist: Nina Simone} and {artist: Sade}, but notes that it is a pale comparison. He "isn't buying" her {genre: easy-listening} act, and wishes she'd do something half as dynamic as what she does with Peaches and BSS. Jim doesn't hesitate to give this [former Sound Opinions guest](/show/13/) a full-out {tag: Trash It}. {host: Greg} is a little more kind, but wishes that the bedroom singer had actually emerged from her bedroom to make this record. He thinks her voice sounds terrific as always, but wasn't won over by most of the songwriting. He gives {album: The Reminder} a {tag: Burn It}.

## 00:10:22 Review: Battles
![Mirrored](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/83/ad/28/83ad28e0-554b-25db-fc10-cba78243cefb/source/600x600bb.jpg "33568718/251186625")
Up next is {album: Mirrored} by the {genre: math rock} outfit {artist: Battles}. The {place: New York} quartet has been getting a lot of attention by {genre: indie rock} fans for their unique take on {genre: instrumental} music. In fact, the band won't even describe their music as instrumental, but rather music without any lyrics. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} both love the combination of {genre: electronica} and {era: 1970s} {genre: prog rock}. Greg even compares their unique melodies and compositions to that of {genre: space age pop} musician {artist: Esquivel}. Both critics note how this cerebral brand of music can usually be kind of cold and off-putting, but, Battles has put a human touch to it. Therefore {album: Mirrored} gets two {tag: Buy It}s.

## 00:21:50 Review: The Arctic Monkeys
![Favourite Worst Nightmare](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/40/d3/c1/40d3c1e5-915d-a641-3ad2-09bd3de394d5/source/600x600bb.jpg "62820413/251499221")
{artist: The Arctic Monkeys} is one of the biggest success stories of recent years. The English group's debut album {album: Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not}, was the fastest selling album in {place: U.K.} history. Their U.S. sales were not as strong, but people were still anxious to hear what the group would do for its sophomore act. In fact, they face the same scrutiny that hot debut bands like {artist: Franz Ferdinand} and {artist: The Strokes} had to overcome. Neither {host: Jim} nor {host: Greg} think that their new album, {album: Favourite Worst Nightmare}, will be any more successful stateside than the last, but both urge listeners to give it a listen. Greg compares lead singer and chief songwriter {name: Alex Turner} to some of the best British wits including {name: Ray Davies} and {name: Damon Albarn}, and likens his songs to short stories. Jim agrees, calling Turner an astute social critic. The Arctic Monkeys may not be the phenomenon it once was, but {album: Favourite Worst Nightmare} gets two {tag: Buy It}s.

## 00:30:12 Review: Mavis Staples
![We'll Never Turn Back](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music117/v4/fa/4b/f6/fa4bf693-dbe5-3235-2cfe-d7052a847229/source/600x600bb.jpg "49985/262485518")
{artist: Mavis Staples}' new album, {album: We'll Never Turn Back}, is up next. Inspired by current racial violence and tension, the {artist: Staples Singers} vocalist was joined by {name: Ry Cooder}, {name: Jim Keltner}, and members of {artist: The Freedom Singers} to make an update of the civil rights music of the {era: 1960s}. This is a perfect fit for Mavis. Her father, {name: Pops Staples}, steered their family toward freedom songs, and eventually the Staples Singers became {name: Martin Luther King, Jr.}'s favorite group. The result is something that pays respect to the past, but is very relevant in the present. {host: Jim} gives the credit to Mavis. He thinks she is completely underrated and calls her a "national treasure." He wishes that Mavis and the band were doing more shows in support of the album and gives it a {tag: Buy It}. {host: Greg} goes even further by naming {album: We'll Never Turn Back} the best album of 2007 -- and it's only May! He commands listeners to Buy It for themselves and everyone they know.

## 00:41:42 Review: El-P
![I'll Sleep When You're Dead](https://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2016/El-P.jpg)
Rapper and producer {artist: El-P}'s new album is {album: I'll Sleep When You're Dead}. This is the second solo release for the {place: Brooklyn} artist, who made his dent as the founder of {genre: hip hop} group {artist: Company Flow} and {genre: indie} label {label: Definitive Jux}. El-P prides himself on making hip hop that is in keeping with the genre's roots: two turntables and a microphone. But, rather than rely on beats and {genre: soul} samples, El-P's collages are futuristic, and according to Greg, "skuzzy." So much so, that he compares the rapper to {name: Trent Reznor}, who also makes an appearance on the record. As {host: Jim} explains, the dark, complicated soundscapes match the verses, which talk about violence and paranoia in the post-9/11 world. The songs are political, but not preachy, and Jim recommends them to anyone who is a fan of hip hop, or just a fan of interesting music. {host: Greg} praises El-P for being a classicist who can also look to the future. There's nothing stale or nostalgic here, but Greg warns that {album: I'll Sleep When I'm Dead} could be a little too challenging for some people's ears. With that small advisory, El-P gets two {tag: Buy It}s.

## 00:49:17 Review: Björk
![Volta (Deluxe Version)](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/a5/3e/c8/a53ec881-6330-09c4-b943-81483a7e5021/source/600x600bb.jpg "295015/252664478")
Finally, we get to {artist: Björk}. The reigning {place: Iceland}ic music queen just released her sixth studio album, {album: Volta}. After abandoning her trademark {genre: electronic} beats for vocals with {album: Medulla}, Björk has returned to form and enlisted the help of beat-makers like {name: Timbaland}. She is also joined by Antony of {artist: Antony and the Johnsons} and {place: Mali}an kora player {artist: Toumani Diabate}. While listeners hear two of the more upbeat tracks, including the Timbaland produced "{track: Earth Intruders}," the rest of the album is more of a mixed bag -- a fact that is frustrating to Greg. To him there were great moments, but also abysmal ones. He realizes that Björk is being intentionally political and provocative, but the album as a whole is just too incoherent for her message to be heard. {host: Greg} can only give {album: Volta} a {tag: Burn It} rating. {host: Jim} can't even agree that Björk is being provocative. To him, the singer is just trying to make us think, ["Boy, isn't she weird?"](http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2001/03/26/bjork.gif) He found himself hating this record, describing it as cold, pretentious and dreadful. Jim not only gives {album: Volta} a {tag: Trash It} rating, but would like to give away the copy he currently has.
