# Show 516: Twin Peaks & Opinions on The Dead Weather

![Twin Peaks](http://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2015/twinpeaks_web.jpg)

{place: Chicago} {genre: garage-rock} band {artist: Twin Peaks} formed when its members were still in high school. Now the group is playing big festivals and shows around the world. They join {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} for a special live performance and conversation at the {place: Goose Island Barrelhouse}. Plus, a review of the new album from {name: Jack White}'s band {artist: The Dead Weather}.


## 00:02:13 News: 10.16.15
    
"{tag: Hamilton}" is making history this week, not only because it's the first {genre: hip-hop}-driven {place: Broadway} musical recounting the life of our nation's original Treasury secretary, but because its album debuted at #12 on the Billboard 200. That is the highest a cast recording debut has seen since {era: 1961}. It sold 30,000 copies in its first week, so the playwright/performer {name: Lin-Manuel Miranda} is doing something right with this peculiar pairing of history and hip-hop.  

{tag: Pandora Media}, the biggest name in {tag: Internet radio}, stepped into the ticketing business Wednesday after buying {tag: Ticketfly}, a vendor that last year sold 16 million tickets worth $500 million. Pandora is known for gathering {tag: user data} for {tag: targeting}, and with this new purchase, {tag: venues} and {tag: promoters} can target cities and markets where {tag: concerts} would be most successful. With an 80 million-strong audience, the Pandora-Ticketfly partnership will pose a challenge to major Ticketfly competitor, {tag: Ticketmaster}. 

Feline Internet sensation {name: Lil Bub} is making a name for herself in the music industry. Coming off a performance on a track in {artist: Run the Jewels}' cat-ified album, {album: Meow the Jewels}, this cool cat is striking out on her own, announcing Wednesday that she will release a debut album called {album: Science & Magic}. According to her album co-producer {name: Matt Tobey}, Bub has a vision, and the result is sure to be meow-velous.

## 00:08:35 Interview: Twin Peaks

Our guests this week are {genre: garage rock}ers, {artist: Twin Peaks}. This 5-piece up-and-coming band from {place: Chicago} consists of singer and guitarist Cadien Lake James, bassist Jack Dolan, guitarist Clay Frankel, drummer Connor Brodner and recent addition, keyboardist Colin Croom. They started the group back in {era: 2009} as high schoolers and later decided to drop out of college to pursue music full-time. Some of their influences include {artist: The Rolling Stones}, {artist: The Beach Boys} and {artist: The Stooges}, which you can hear in their debut album, {album: Sunken}, released in {era: 2013}. Last year, they released their second album, {album: Wild Onion}, to critical acclaim and in {era: 2015} performed at {tag: Lollapalooza}. Their youthfully energetic performance style, {genre: guitar-based rock and roll} and playful song lyrics make them a draw for young adult music fans looking for something other than {genre: EDM}. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} spoke to them a few weeks ago at the {tag: Goose Island Barrelhouse} in Chicago and gave a performance afterwards.


## 00:40:20 Review: The Dead Weather
![Dodge and Burn](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music7/v4/b5/e2/81/b5e28186-b20d-0e95-12b0-640e3d09a051/DW_DodgeAndBurn_Cover_iTunes_3000x3000.jpg/600x600bb-85.jpg "307168816/1029604013")
{artist: The Dead Weather} formed in 2009 as a {tag: supergroup} of sorts, sporting a lineup of {artist: Jack White}, {name: Alison Mosshart} of {artist: The Kills}, {name: Dean Fertita} of {artist: Queens of the Stone Age}, and {name: Jack Lawrence} of {artist: The Raconteurs}. Now the band has returned with its third album, {album: Dodge and Burn}. White is taking a literal and figurative back seat here as he remains behind the drum kit, and {host: Greg} is grateful for the showcase of Mosshart's excellent vocal talents. He also cites Fertita as the band's secret weapon, using distorted guitars and keyboards to bring an element of pure nastiness to the record. Despite a couple of missteps, including the odd closing piano ballad "{track: Impossible Winner}," *Dodge and Burn* is a {tag: Buy It} for Greg. {host: Jim} concurs – the dirty {genre: blues} {genre: garage rock} may be nothing new, but its swampy, {tag: southern Gothic} flavor is perfect for {tag: Halloween} season. It's a Buy It for him, too.


## 00:49:02 DIJ: Greg
{host: Greg} has been enjoying {artist: Elvis Costello}'s new memoir {tag: *Unfaithful Music & Disappearing Ink*}. While he finds Costello's career as a whole to be hit-or-miss, he's reminded of how great the first four or five albums were – in particular, 1978's {album: This Year's Model}. Costello was often lumped into {genre: punk} and {genre: New Wave}, but his band {name: The Attractions} had more musical chops than most bands in those movements. Their instrumental virtuosity really came out performing Costello's claustrophobic songs about anger, frustration, and guilt. "{track: Lipstick Vogue}" features an incredible drum part by {name: Pete Thomas} that, according to Greg, is a highlight of Costello's entire career. That warrants its inclusion into the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}.
