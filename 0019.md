# Show 19: Jenny Lewis & Reviews of Prince and The Flaming Lips

This week Jim and Greg get a visit from one of the reigning indie pop queens—{name : Jenny Lewis}. Plus they'll review the new albums from {artist : Prince} and {artist : The Flaming Lips} and pop a quarter into the Desert Island Jukebox.

## 00:02:11 Review: Prince

![3121](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/19/3N0.jpg)

This week's show begins with a discussion of the artist formerly known as the artist formerly known as {artist : Prince}. The enigmatic musician made news this week when his new album {album : 3121} debuted at Number 1 on the {tag : Billboard} charts. Hard to believe, but this was Prince's first number-one debut. He has since been dethroned by {place : Atlanta} rapper {artist : T.I.}, but it was certainly an impressive comeback for this revolutionary {genre : pop} icon. Before giving reviews of the album, {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} discuss other late-career comebacks. In the {era : '90s} the {artist : Grateful Dead} found a new audience with their only {genre : Top 40} song, "{track : Touch of Grey}." {artist : Santana} is another artist whose first couple of albums went platinum, but did not find further success until 1999's {album : Supernatural}. That album, which paired the guitarist with {genre : contemporary pop} artists like {artist : Rob Thomas}, {artist : Wyclef Jean} and {artist : Everlast}, sold 15 million copies. {name : Clive Davis} tried this same approach with Prince on the album {album : Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic}, but the results were not as, um, fantastic. Other late career successes include {artist : Eric Clapton}, {artist : Bonnie Raitt}, and most recently, {artist : Mariah Carey}. So is {album : 3121} an artistic comeback as well as a commercial one? For {host : Jim}, it is not the achievement that Prince's earlier albums were, but still merits a {tag : Buy It} rating. {host : Greg} is not so kind. There are a handful of tracks that are worth sampling, but this critic only suggests you {tag : Burn It}.



## 00:15:13 Intro: Music News

{host : Jim} and {host : Greg} take time to pay tribute to {artist : Buck Owens}. The {genre : country} pioneer died recently at the age of 76 and was buried this week in his hometown of {place : Bakersfield, CA}. While most of the headlines simply refer to Owens as the "star of Hee Haw," he made significant contributions to {genre : rock} and {genre : country} music. According to Greg, he was one of the first musicians to use the {tag : Telecaster}. You can hear some of that great, gritty fuzz tone in "{track : Who's Gonna Mow Your Grass}." He also played with the original {genre : alt-country} rebel, {artist : Merle Haggard}. Owens was not the cornpone country singer that Hee Haw made him out to be, and for this reason he was respected by people like {artist : The Beatles}, {artist : Dwight Yoakam} and {artist : Steve Earle}.



## 00:21:43 Interview: Jenny Lewis

Another {place : California} native with a {genre : country} spirit is {genre : singer/songwriter}  {artist : Jenny Lewis}. The {artist : Rilo Kiley} frontwoman joins {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} to talk about her latest solo album, {album : Rabbit Fur Coat}. Last year Rilo Kiley achieved some success with their second album {album : More Adventurous}, and even opened for {artist : Coldplay} and played at {tag : Coachella}. Therefore, the timing of this solo project seems to be curious. As Jenny explains, however, doing solo projects and side projects has always been apart of her band's experience. She previously worked with {name : Ben Gibbard} on {artist : The Postal Service}, and Rilo Kiley bandmate {name : Blake Sennett} has another band called {artist : The Elected}.

One of Jenny's motivations for this solo album was her desire to sing with women. She is joined on {album : Rabbit Fur Coat} and in our studio by {artist : The Watson Twins}, Chandra and Leigh Watson. Jenny explains that she grew up singing with her mother and was inspired by albums like {album : Gonna Take a Miracle} by {artist : Laura Nyro and LaBelle}.

It should be noted that Jenny didn't just grow up singing. She was also a fairly successful child actress and appeared in '{genre : 80s} movies like {tag : Troop Beverly Hills} and {tag : The Wizard}. She explores some of that history on the album. She also addresses people who are skeptical of her authenticity -- being that she was born in {place : Las Vegas} and bred in {place : L.A.} rather than Kentucky. But, as Jenny points out and as listeners learned in the previous segment, California and towns like Bakersfield have significant country roots. Oddly enough, Jenny is not the only member of Rilo Kiley to have that dreaded "child actor" label. Blake Sennett was a regular on shows like {tag : Boy Meets World} and {tag : Salute Your Shorts}.



## 00:43:48 Review: The Flaming Lips

![At War with the Mystics](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/19/2100.jpg)

Next up is a review of the new {artist : [The] Flaming Lips} album {album : At War With the Mystics}. The {place : Oklahoma} band has been around for almost 25 years, and this is their 12th album. The Lips' first big breakthrough came in 1993 with {album : Transmissions from the Satellite Heart}. That album was lauded by {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} at the time, and the single "{track : She Don't Use Jelly}" was one of the big {genre : alternative} hits of the year. Then, in 1999, the band released {album : The Soft Bulletin}, which became a huge critical success, and in 2002, the band finally got some commercial recognition with their first Gold album {album : Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots}. After listening to one of the new songs, "{track : Pompeii am Gotterdammerung}" (which gives multi-instrumentalist and musical wizard {name : Steven Drozd} his first stab at vocals), Greg gives his review of the album. Jim refrains from offering his review because he feels he is too close to the work. Mr. DeRogatis just released his 5th book, {tag : *Staring at Sound: The True Story of Oklahoma's Fabulous Flaming Lips*}, and the journalist in him can't give a rating of the record. However, listeners can certainly surmise his opinions after listening to our hosts' discussion. Greg admits off the bat that he is not blown away. He feels like the band tried to out-gimmick itself, providing the song "{track : Yeah Yeah Yeah}" as an example. Greg admits that the songs translate better live, and Jim predicts that come this summer, when the Flaming Lips perform at {tag : Lollapalooza}, Greg will have to eat his {tag : Burn It}. We'll just have to wait and see.



## 00:55:39 DIJ: Greg

This week Mr. Kot makes a {tag : Desert Island Jukebox} pick. He chooses "{track : Fever}" by {artist : Peggy Lee}. "{track : Fever}" is a rare example of a white singer covering a song by a black artist and actually bringing something positive to it. "{track : Fever}" was originally recorded by {artist : Little Willie John}. Greg points out that Peggy Lee is the last person you'd imagine covering a testosterone-fueled {genre : R&B} song like "{track : Fever}," but she certainly was up to the task.
