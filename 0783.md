## 00:28:25 Feature: Pylon
![Pylon](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2020/pylon.jpeg)

{artist: Pylon} came and went about 40 years ago. All they did was help build a scene in {place: Athens, Ga}., in the {era: late ‘70s}, hot on the heels of {artist: the B-52’s} but before {artist: R.E.M.} got rolling. The four University of Georgia art students released a handful of recordings, including two albums, filled with jagged-edge {genre: post-punk} songs you could dance to.

And then they quietly called it a night, destined to be an obscure if important footnote at a key moment in music history. A new box preserves the legacy, the rare band that didn’t release a single throwaway. It could be argued that Pylon pulled the plug too soon, but Jim and Greg are grateful for what they left behind. It’s never too late to fall in love, again, with a great band.
