## 00:02:01 News: 6.6.14
If you've ever purchased tickets through {tag: Ticketmaster}, then you probably understand it can be a frustrating experience, especially with those extra fees.  Well, as it turns out, some of those {tag: fees} were misleading. According to a lawsuit, those so-called "convenience" and "facility" fees were actually just ways for Ticketmaster to make a profit. In {era: 2003}, ticket buyers began to complain, and now ten years later, the class action {tag: lawsuit} between {tag: Live Nation} (which acquired Ticketmaster in 2010) and 50 million ticket buyers has been settled with Live Nation on the hook for almost $400 million. But before you start making plans for what to do with your piece of the pie, beware that the "payment" to wronged ticket buyers will actually only be a limited number of discount codes for $2.50 off your next Ticketmaster purchase.

## 00:04:04 Interview: Richard Thompson
{artist: Richard Thompson} is a {genre: rock} survivor, and with each decade comes a new successful era--whether it's {artist: Fairport Convention} in the {era: 1960's}, with {name: Linda Thompson} in the {era: '70s} or as a solo artist. (You can check out producer, Joe Boyd, talking about Thompson & Fairport Convention [here](/show/387/#joeboyd).) In fact, he's one of only a handful of artists, along the likes of {artist: Bob Dylan} and {artist: Neil Young}, who have sustained a high level of artistic intensity and integrity since the {era: '60s}. And to further set him apart, he's one of few guitar heroes from that generation without an obvious debt to the {genre: blues}. Instead, you'll hear blends of Eastern tones, {genre: jazz}, {genre: Scottish balladry} and {genre: Celtic folk}. Jim and Greg agree he's one of the most underrated guitarists and songwriters in {genre: folk} history and would urge acts like {artist: Mumford & Sons} to "Listen and Learn." The first step would be to study his live performance, which includes a gem from the "{label: Capitol }years," the yet to be released "{track: Fergus Lang}," and the Richard and Linda classic "{track: I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight}." Plus, check out the bonus track, Greg's request, "{track: Dimming of the Day}," which may be his most beautiful love song to date. 


## 00:49:27 Review: Jack White
![Lazaretto](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music2/v4/15/57/2a/15572ad7-d59d-9a5a-94c3-5df973308289/source/600x600bb.jpg "826980/855605167")
{artist: Jack White} has just released his second solo album, {album: Lazaretto}. Jim and Greg both [loved](http://www.soundopinions.org/show/335/review/jackwhite) the previous solo album {album: Blunderbuss}, because it distinguished White's solo work from his other various projects like {artist: The White Stripes}, {artist: The Raconteurs} & {artist: The Dead Weather}. {host: Jim} thinks that {album: Lazaretto} is very similar to {album: Blunderbuss}, and that's a good thing. The hooks are there, the melange of genres; garage rock, blues, gospel are there, and his guitar playing is as good as ever. Jim gives {album: Lazaretto} a {tag: Buy It} rating. {host: Greg} thinks the album is very good as well, but wishes there was more of a departure sonically from {album: Blunderbuss}. He thinks {artist: Jack White} has more sounds up his sleeve wishes he showcased them more on Lazaretto. As a result, Greg gives the album a {tag: Try It} rating.
