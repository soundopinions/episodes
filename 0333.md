# Show 333: Alabama Shakes & Opinions on Nicki Minaj

![main image](http://static.soundopinions.org/images/2012/alabamashakes.jpg)

Tune in for a {tag: live performance} from the breakout band of the moment, {artist: The Alabama Shakes}. 

## 00:01:44 News: 04.13.12
There's no limit to the inspiration {artist: Bob Dylan} provides in every medium. The latest example? A Brazilian production company has acquired the rights to adapt Dylan's 1975 album {album: Blood on the Tracks} into an English-language feature film. Whether you subscribe to the theory that the album was inspired by Dylan's marital woes or {name: Anton Chekhov} short stories, as Dylan asserts, the producers plan on capturing the "feeling" of the album. Jim and Greg suggest some albums that might make better cinematic adaptations:

- {album: The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society}
- {album: The River}
- {album: The ArchAndroid}
- {album: Parklife}
- {album: Zen Arcade}
- {album: The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway}
- {album: Funeral}

{name: Jim Marshall}, the father of loud and the inventor of the {tag: Marshall amp} died last week at age 88. As Jim explains, nothing beats the power of the Marshall. Its sound was coveted by everyone from {artist: Jimi Hendrix} to {artist: Nirvana}. Only {artist: Spinal Tap}'s Nigel Tufnel felt the need to improve it.

## 00:10:16 Interview: The Alabama Shakes
{artist: The Alabama Shakes} have only just released one full-length album and its members are only their early 20s, but already they are receiving a staggering amount of praise. Their fans include critics as well as {name: Patterson Hood} of the {artist: Drive-By Truckers} and {artist: Jack White}. Jim and Greg think they deserve every accolade they get for successfully bringing back and updating that great {genre: soul} and {genre: rock} sound of the {place: south} in the '{era: 60s} and '{era: 70s}. The quartet includes lead {tag: singer} {name: Brittany Howard}, {tag: guitarist} {name: Heath Fogg}, {tag: bassist} {name: Zac Cockrell}, and {tag: drummer} {name: Steve Johnson}, plus touring {tag: keyboard player} {name: Ben Tanner}. And Brittany and Heath explain to our hosts that they have diverse musical tastes, but are certainly very influenced by the Muscle Shoals sound. Another key to loving the Alabama Shakes? Brittany's voice, of which she's too modest. 

## 00:49:15 Review: Nicki Minaj
![Pink Friday (Roman Reloaded) [Deluxe Edition]](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/07/f7/d4/07f7d47f-d337-c477-6bcf-2179ce895344/source/600x600bb.jpg "278464538/525256507")

She may be {genre: hip hop}'s answer to {artist: Lady Gaga}. {artist: Nicki Minaj} has the hair and costumes, and now chart success to boot. Her new album {album: Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded} has gone to #1, taking down fellow diva {artist: Madonna}. It's a follow up to 2010's {album: Pink Friday}, which Jim thought had an interesting and unlikely combination of diverse elements including Missy Elliott's eccentricity and Lil Kim's provocation. But now she's added pop to the stew, and things aren't melding as well. {host: Jim} criticizes the sub-American Idol balladry and her awful singing. But most offensive is her harsh language about women. {host: Greg} agrees Minaj is a frustrating artist. He's fascinated by some of her work and her alter-ego Roman Zolanski, but she falls into some terrible clich√©s. *Roman Reloaded* gets a double {tag: Trash It}.
