# Show 199: U2 & Opinions on Anvil
Love 'em or hate 'em, {name: Bono} and {artist: U2} are one of the biggest forces in music today. Tune in to hear {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} trace their path from {place: Dublin} kids to stadium giants. Later they review the new album from {genre: heavy metal} band {artist: Anvil}.

## 00:02:02 News: 09.18.09
{artist: The Beatles} remasters were a big success story for {label: Apple Corp}. In one week they sold more than 600,000 albums in the {place: U.S.} and had 13 of the 14 best-selling catalog albums. So the question is, are they worth it? {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} give their answers. The sound is improved, but the packaging isn't much to write home about. And, as Jim says, how many new Beatles formats should fans be expected to buy? Greg thinks the real gems are the Fab Four's mono mixes, but those are only available as a separate and pricey box set. Jim and Greg think fans deserve a little more for their money.

Two rock lawsuits are making the news. First, The {name: Ellen DeGeneres} Show is being sued by some of the largest record companies for copyright infringement. As viewers know, Ellen frequently and enthusiastically dances during the show. Unfortunately for her she doesn't like any fair-use beats. Instead she's boogied down to over 1,000 copyrighted pop songs without permission. As Jim notes, the ironies abound: Ellen has not only hosted the recording industry's biggest award show, The Grammys, but she's been tapped as a new judge on {tag: American Idol}, who works in partnership with {label: Sony Music}, one of the plaintiffs.

Next is an update on a lawsuit Jim and Greg discussed earlier this year. Guitar shredder {artist: Joe Satriani} sued {artist: Coldplay} for ripping off his composition {track: If I Could Fly}, in their track {track: Viva La Vida}. The suit has been dropped, and while no financial details have been revealed, Coldplay doesn't have to admit to any guilt.

![Jim Carroll](http://static.soundopinions.org/images/2009/jim_c.jpg)Famed poet, spoken word artist and punk rocker {artist: Jim Carroll} passed away last week at the age of 60. Carroll may be best known for his 1978 book {tag: The Basketball Diaries}, which was adapted into a film of the same name. He was also very involved in the CBGB's punk scene of the 1970s, and under the encouragement of {artist: Patti Smith}, transformed his poetry into music. To honor Carroll, Jim and Greg play {track: People Who Died} from his 1980 album {album: Catholic Boy}.

## 00:20:45 Special: U2
{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} recently experienced the launch of {artist: U2}'s new arena tour. While neither believe that music is at its best in a stadium, Greg admits that the band has mastered the art of spectacle. Jim was happy to hear a number of songs from U2's latest album {album: No Line on the Horizon}, but wouldn't recommend anyone pay over $200 to see the show.

The concert got our hosts thinking about U2's place in music history. Very few rock bands from the {era: '70s} and {era: '80s} can still sell out stadiums around the world. But they didn't begin at such a large scale. Jim and Greg trace U2's journey to this blockbuster point and discuss the band's different artistic phases and career highs and lows. They agree that {album: Achtung Baby} is U2's masterpiece, and can't stomach some of the righteousness and bombast of records like {album: The Unforgettable Fire} and {album: The Joshua Tree}. But each has a unique favorite. Jim chooses to highlight {track: An Cat Dubh} from the 1980 album {album: Boy}, and Greg plays "{track: Your Blue Room}" from the 1995 {artist: Brian Eno} produced album {artist: Passengers}: {album: Original Soundtracks 1}.

## 00:47:14 Review: Anvil
![This Is Thirteen](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/f7/d4/b3/f7d4b359-9be3-aafe-a2ae-0eba81efe480/source/600x600bb.jpg "129779577/329675819")

{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} end the show with a review of {album: This Is Thirteen} by the {place: Toronto} {genre: metal} band {artist: Anvil}. Anvil is influential in the speed and thrash communities, but hasn't received much mainstream attention until now. The reason for the increased exposure is the release of the critically acclaimed documentary {tag: Anvil! The Story of Anvil}, which chronicles the band's tough road. Jim calls Anvil a "meat and potatoes" metal band, but hears the conviction and heart in their music. He gives {album: This is Thirteen} a {tag: Try It}. Greg loves their sound. They aren't on the {artist: Motorhead} level of fame, but have a similar hard, no-nonsense style. The drummer really kicks it into gear for Greg, and he gives Anvil's new record a {tag: Buy It}.
