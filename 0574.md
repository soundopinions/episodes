![Jon Brion](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2016/jonbrion.jpg)
{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} revisit one of their favorite interviews in the history of the show: a 2006 conversation with multi-instrumentalist, songwriter, producer, and film composer {artist: Jon Brion}. Brion has produced for artists like [{artist: Aimee Mann}](http://soundopinions.org/show/372/), {artist: Fiona Apple}, [{artist: Spoon}](http://soundopinions.org/show/476/), and {artist: Kanye West} and worked as a session player for {artist: Macy Gray} and others. He's collaborated with filmmakers like {name: Paul Thomas Anderson}, {name: Michel Gondry}, and {name: Charlie Kaufman}, providing the score for {album: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind}, {album: Punch-Drunk Love}, {album: Synechdoche, New York}, {album: I ♥ Huckabees}, and more.

But Jon Brion is also an accomplished solo artist with one solo album, {album: Meaningless}, to his name. Brion has grown a devoted following for his decades-long residency at the {place: Los Angeles} club {place: Largo}. At his shows, Brion improvises spectacular sets of originals and covers as he shows off his virtuosity on every instrument. He demonstrates his skills through performances of some of his compositions in front of a small audience. He also demonstrates to Jim and Greg the difference between the art of songwriting (as exemplified by {artist: [George] Gershwin} and {artist: Kurt Cobain}) and what he calls "performance pieces."


## 00:49:47 Review: Emeli Sandé
![Long Live the Angels](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/d4/92/ad/d492ad06-6fdf-9abf-f4ca-630a8c5ddac9/source/600x600bb.jpg "324008615/1172028263")

Scottish singer and songwriter {artist: Emeli Sandé} just released her sophomore album, {album: Long Live the Angels}. Sandé first gained worldwide recognition when she performed in the closing ceremonies of the 2012 London Olympics. This release is her first record in four years and features collaborations with producers {artist: Mac & Phil} and {artist: Naughty Boy}, as well as with rapper {artist: Jay Electronica}. Jim and Greg have been fans from the beginning, and Sandé was a [guest on the show back in 2013](http://soundopinions.org/show/384/#emelisande). {host: Greg} really enjoys this album, and appreciates that she's taken away some of the overproduction that crowded her debut. He also likes that she takes personal heartbreak (she recently went through a divorce) to generate genuine music ranging from blue ballads to celebratory songs. Greg gives it a {tag: Buy It}. {host: Jim} agrees, and thinks the production on Long Live the Angels sounds great. He points out that Emeli Sandé is giving us the best of both Knowles sisters: the underground sensibility of {artist: Solange} and the mainstream mood of {artist: Beyoncé} (but not in a derivative way.) Jim gives this record a {tag: Buy It}.
