# Show 719: James Alexander of the Bar-Kays & Favorite Bass Lines

![barkay](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2019/barkays.jpg)

This week, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} are joined by legendary {genre: funk} and {genre: R&B} bassist {artist: James Alexander} of the {artist: Bar-Kays}. They discuss his early days as a pivotal part of the {label: Stax Records} house band in {place: Memphis} and the enduring legacy of 1971's {tag: Shaft} Soundtrack, which featured the Bar-Kays as the backing band. Then, Jim and Greg share some of their favorite {tag: bass lines} (as well as the songs' players). Bass players usually aren't the flashiest members of a band, but they're a pivotal part of its heartbeat.



## 00:01:35 Interview: James Alexander
{genre: 1967}'s {track: Soul Finger} by {artist: The Bar-Kays} is one of the most instantly recognizable instrumentals of its era, and on the bass is {artist: James Alexander}. The Bar-Kays played a pivotal part in {label: Stax Record}s' studio system, eventually replacing {artist: Booker T & the MGs} as the primary session band behind labelmates like {artist: Albert King}, {artist: The Emotions} and {artist: Isaac Hayes}. They were also consistent hitmakers in their own right that charted throughout the {era: '70s} and {era: '80s} with jams like "{track: Holy Ghost}" and "{track: Son of Shaft}." Additionally, the Bar-Kays were the backing band on Isaac Hayes's award-winning {album: Shaft} soundtrack. This year, the original soundtrack was re-released in a new box set with almost two dozen previously unreleased tracks that feature The Bar-Kays. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} talk with James Alexander about the making of the historic Shaft soundtrack, as well as a turning point in Alexander's career when tragedy struck the Stax Records family. 

In early December of 1967, the music world was rocked by news of a plane crash near {place: Madison, Wisconsin}. {artist: Otis Redding} and Bar-Kays members {artist: Ronnie Caldwell}, {artist: Phalon Jones}, {artist: Jimmy King}, and {artist: Carl Cunningham} were killed in the crash, only trumpeter {artist: Ben Cauley} survived (miraculously, James didn't take that flight.) In their conversation, James discusses with Jim and Greg what it was like to overcome catastrophe so early in his career.
