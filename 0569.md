# Show 569: Songs That Give You the Creeps & Opinions on Leonard Cohen

![Songs That Give You the Creeps](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2016/creepysongs_web.jpg)

The spookiest time of the year is upon us. To celebrate {tag: Halloween}, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} turn the show over to listeners who share the songs that tingle their spines the most. Plus, they share their thoughts on {artist: Bob Dylan}'s {tag: Nobel Prize} and review the latest from singer-songwriter {artist: Leonard Cohen}.

On October 13, American icon {artist: Bob Dylan} [was awarded](https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2016/) the 2016 {tag: Nobel Prize} in Literature for "having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition." This has generated plenty of controversy over whether Dylan's output is worthy, or if a popular songwriter should even be eligible for a literature award. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} are ambivalent. They both certainly think that Dylan is a treasure to the world (evidenced by our [multipart](/show/548) [episode](/show/549) on his career). But they feel his lyrics can't be separated from his music â€“ it's not just what he says, but *how* he sings it. Dylan, also, seems to not care much, as he [still hasn't even responded](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/17/nobel-prize-bob-dylan-unable-to-reach) to any of the {tag: Swedish Academy}'s calls inviting him to the Nobel ceremony.

## 00:43:55 Review: Leonard Cohen
![You Want It Darker](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/569/2170.jpg)
   At the age of 82 singer/songwriter {artist: Leonard Cohen} is the most prolific he has ever been. Unfortunately, this uptick in recording and touring is a necessity after a manager bilked him out of most of his savings. The upside is he continues to produce quality work and that is evident on his 14th studio album, {album: You Want it Darker}. {host: Greg} says the album finds the aging Cohen wrestling with mortality, god and religion. All with his patented dry-wit. The album is aided with a flattering production that often sounds like the songs could be set in a church while still emphasizing Cohen's baritone voice. That said, Greg says it is not the best album to introduce people to Leonard Cohen, but if you're a fan (as Greg is) this is a {tag: buy it}. {host: Jim} agrees it is a {tag: buy it} but disagrees about the accessibility of the album saying he's "never been funnier, nor has he been more talented...this is prime Cohen."  You Want it Darker is a double buy it.  



## 00:50:31 DIJ: Greg
{name: Bob Dylan}'s {tag: Nobel Prize} for Literature got {host: Greg} thinking about other great {genre: rock} lyricists and the people who influenced them. {artist: Chuck Berry} is often thought of for his pioneering work with the guitar but he's also a masterful lyricist. Greg points specifically to the {era: 1964} song {track: Nadine} and the vivid imagery that Chuck conveys.
