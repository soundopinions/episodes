## 00:01:30 Classic Album Dissection: Purple Rain

Believe it or not, {artist : Prince}'s blockbuster album {album : Purple Rain} turns 40-years-old this month. To mark the occasion, {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} give {album : Purple Rain} the *Classic Album Dissection* treatment. They talk to former Revolution members {name : Wendy Melvoin} and {name : Lisa Coleman} about their relationship with Prince and the making of the album. {artist : Wendy & Lisa} went on the become a musical duo, and also score music for TV shows like {tag : Heroes} and {tag : Nurse Jackie}, which won them an Emmy Award in 2010. But back in {era : 1984}, they were part of Prince's first major recording and performing team -- Wendy on guitar and Lisa on keyboards. As Jim and Greg explain, it was unique for Prince to be collaborate on this level. The auteur even shared songwriting credits with {artist : The Revolution}. Jim and Greg also credit Wendy and Lisa with opening Prince up to new music and new sounds.

To continue their dissection, {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} talk about two specific songs from {album : Purple Rain}. Jim plays "{track : Darling Nikki}", one of the only songs on the album written solely by Prince. It was targeted by {name : Tipper Gore} and the {tag : PMRC} for its suggestive lyrics, but Jim sees it as a love/lust story similar to {artist : The Beatles}' "{track : Norwegian Wood}". Greg chooses "{track : When Doves Cry}". With no bass line, multiple guitar parts and a multi-tracked voice, it's a perfect example of Prince's modern and {genre : avant-garde} side.

To wrap up this look back at Purple Rain, {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} pay tribute to the late artist, and they each highlight a song from Prince's huge vault of unreleased music that was not available until after the artists's death. Greg plays "{track : Can't Stop This Feeling I Got}", and praises the song's stripped down nature, crediting one of Prince's former guitarists {artist : Dez Dickerson} with having a heavy influence on the track. {host : Jim} continues in the stripped down lane with the song "{track : You're My Love}", a song that Prince originally wrote for country superstar {artist : Kenny Roger}
