## 00:04:52 Intro: Music News

The nail has just gone in the record store coffin. The {place : Times Square}  {label : Virgin} Megastore, which is the highest volume music store in America, is closing this spring. $55 million in annual revenue was not enough to keep the doors to this landmark retail outfit open. {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} agree that the Virgin store on {place : Broadway} was an institution for any music fan who visited {place : New York City}, and hope that people continue to support what record stores are still out there.

Rocker, poet, fashion designer, activist...now {name : Bono} can add columnist to that ever-growing list. The {artist : U2} frontman just published his first official column for {tag : The New York Times}. It was written about music's other great ego: {artist : Frank Sinatra}. Jim doesn't see why anyone would be interested in the writings of Bono, except for the fact that he is a celebrity. But Greg is a little more hopeful. He admits that Bono is not a great scribe, but thinks that if the singer sticks to what he knows– music– we may be in for some interesting stories.



## 00:10:01 Special: Presidential Rock

On January 20th, thousands will celebrate the Inauguration of {tag : President}-Elect {name : Barack Obama}. But before that {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} wanted to host their own celebration by playing the best songs ever written about the office of Commander-in-Chief.

Here's a collection of songs to kick off this new administration:


### Jim

- {artist : Neil Young}, "{track : Campaigner}"
- {artist : The Ramones}, "{track : Bonzo Goes to Bitburg}"
- {artist : They Might Be Giants}, "{track : James K. Polk}"
- {artist : Lou Reed}, "{track : The Day John Kennedy Died}"


### Greg

- {artist : JB Lenore}, "{track : Eisenhower Blues}"
- {artist : XTC}, "{track : Here Comes President Kill Again}"
- {artist : Wyclef Jean}, "{track : President}"
- {artist : George Clinton}, "{track : Paint the White House Black}"



## 00:47:02 Review: Franz Ferdinand

![Tonight: Franz Ferdinand](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/164/26E0.jpg)

Scottish {genre : indie} rockers {artist : Franz Ferdinand} have a new album out called {album : Tonight: Franz Ferdinand}. It's the third release for the {genre : New-New Wave} band, and after a terrific debut, and a so-so follow-up, Jim and Greg were eager to see what the quartet had to offer. Greg hears a reconfiguration of their original sound. The {genre : dance} element is more up front, making the rhythm section the most important one. Greg keeps waiting for lead singer {name : Alex Kapranos} to step up to the {name : Bryan Ferry} level, and until he does {host : Greg} gives {album : Tonight: Franz Ferdinand} a {tag : Try It}. {host : Jim} doesn't think it's fair to compare any mere mortal to Bryan Ferry and thinks Kapranos does a terrific job. He calls the group's routine "winning" and gives this album a {tag : Buy It}.
