## 00:01:49 Intro: Music News

{artist : METZ}, {artist : Metric}, {artist : Arcade Fire}, {artist : Handsome Furs}, {artist : Feist}… it's been quite a decade for {place : Canadian} music. {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} wonder, what's in the water up there? So they talk to {name : Steve Jordan}, founder of the Canadian music prize {tag : Polaris} about this year's crop of nominees and what value, if any, music prizes still have in today's landscape. Jim and Greg are impressed by the diversity of Polaris [shortlist](http://www.polarismusicprize.ca/2013/) artists, and are even more impressed as to how democratic the prize is, especially compared to our own {tag : Grammy's}.‎

After more than 20 years, {artist : The Replacements} have finally reunited for a series of {tag : RiotFest} shows. Fans have been clamoring for a Replacements reunion since the band broke up in 1991. So was it a success? {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} share their experience at the RiotFest show in {place : Chicago}. You can also check out their print reviews [here](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-09-16/entertainment/chi-replacements-riot-fest--review-20130915_1_guitarist-slim-dunlap-paul-westerberg-riot-fest) and [here](http://www.wbez.org/blogs/jim-derogatis/2013-09/return-replacements-sorta-kinda-not-really-108677).



## 00:21:24  Classic Album Dissection: Let It Be

![Let It Be (Expanded Edition)](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/408/ZO0.jpg)

{artist : The Replacements} reunion offers us a great reason to revisit our 2007 **Classic Album Dissection** of the {era : 1984} release {album : Let It Be}. Unlike previously dissected albums like [{album : Revolver}](/show/117) and [{album : Songs in the Key of Life}](/show/265), {album : Let It Be} wasn't a major critical or commercial success. But, {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} believe it's one of the greatest albums ever made. It was the 4th album from the {place : Minneapolis} band, which was comprised of four "scruffy" members: {name : Paul Westerberg}, {name : Bob Stinson}, {name : Tommy Stinson} and {name : Chris Mars}. As Jim and Greg explain, this album put the band on the map and helped to define what we know today as "{genre : indie} music." To learn more about the making of {album : Let It Be} and why it's so special, Jim and Greg talk with longtime Minneapolis music journalist {name : Jim Walsh}, author of *The Replacements: All Over But the Shouting*. To cap it all off Jim and Greg play what they think is the ultimate {album : Let It Be} song: {track : Unsatisfied}.



## 00:49:42 DIJ: Greg

{host : Jim} and {host : Greg} continue to inspire one another. Last week Jim chose a track by {place : Australian}  {genre : punk} band {artist : The Saints} (inspired by Greg's Australian pick the week before). Now this week Greg wanted to continue highlighting an artist who, like The Saints, kept soul music alive. British "Pub Rocker" {artist : Graham Parker} emerged out of a very white, male scene in the {era : 1970's}. But he also incorporated the {genre : Stax} and {genre : Motown} sounds he grew up loving. Greg adds {track : Pouring It All Out} to the {tag : Desert Island Jukebox}. And you know who else loves Graham Parker? {name : Judd Apatow} and {name : Adam Carolla}, to name a few. {genre : Pub Rock} fans should also check out our interview with [{artist : Nick Lowe}](/show/329).
