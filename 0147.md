## 00:01:45 Review: Kid Rock
![Rock N Roll Jesus](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/147/2X0.jpg)
{artist: Kid Rock}'s 11th album, {album: Rock 'n Roll Jesus}, was released last year, but has become the surprising hit of the summer. {label: Atlantic Records} is crediting keeping the album out of {tag: iTunes} with the huge sales, and is looking at this as a new business model. As a [Wall Street Journal article](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB121987440206377643) explores, avoiding iTunes runs against conventional logic since it's the number one music retailer. But, many labels want to find a way around {name: Steve Jobs}' stronghold and begrudge the power of the single. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} think some artists only have a single or two in them, and explain that Kid Rock might be one of them. They say there's no reason to add to the 1.7 million copies {album: Rock 'n Roll Jesus} has already sold and give the album a {tag: Trash It}.

## 00:10:19 List: Buried Treasures

## 00:47:45 Review: Brian Wilson
![That Lucky Old Sun](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/147/27L0.jpg)

One musician who always seems to be buried, followed by an unearthing, is {artist: Brian Wilson}. The former Beach Boy has had so many comebacks, Jim and Greg aren't even sure where he's coming back from. Is Brian back again with this new record, {album: That Lucky Old Sun}? {host: Greg} explains that some people are saying this album is on par with Wilson's two masterpieces, {album: Pet Sounds} and {album: Smile}. But this critic thinks that's an insult to his previous efforts. He finds this album nostalgic, but takes too long to become emotionally resonant. And, the songs are weighed down by cornball lyrics courtesy of {name: Van Dyke Parks}. {host: Jim} completely agrees and wonders if the troubled artist actually made this record. If he did, he's merely cashing in. If he didn't, it's quite a con. Either way {album: That Lucky Old Sun} gets a double {tag: Trash It}.
