# Show 418: Songs about the Music Business & Opinions on The Warlocks

![musicbusiness](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2013/musicbusiness.jpg)

The Business: What happens when artists take a look inward? Jim and Greg play the best *Songs About the Music Industry*. And they review the new album from the {place: Los Angeles} {genre: psychedelic} rockers {artist: The Warlocks}.

## 00:02:30 News: 11.29.13
You might have seen this viral [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D12UMVA7Ztw) by San Francisco-based toy company {tag: GoldieBlox} featuring a feisty reinterpretation of the  {artist: Beastie Boys} song "{track: Girls}." The start-up is now enmeshed in a legal dispute over its right to use the song. The bizarre part? GoldieBlox started it. The company filed a pre-emptive strike against the Beasties claiming that the video, as a parody, constitutes fair use. (It reminds Greg of a similar [lawsuit](http://marquee.blogs.cnn.com/2013/08/16/robin-thicke-pharell-and-t-i-sue-over-blurred-lines/) that Robin Thicke and Co. filed this summer. The Beastie Boys [responded](http://music-mix.ew.com/2013/11/25/beastie-boys-respond-to-goldieblox-lawsuit-with-open-letter/): "As creative as it is, make no mistake, your video is an advertisement that is designed to sell a product." It looks like you gotta [fight](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBShN8qT4lk) for your right to parodyâ€¦
 
As GoldieBlox realized, a good ad soundtrack can really break a product (or a [song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIOW9fLT9eY) for that matter) into the public consciousness. But these days, songs used in ads are often separated from their products, thanks in large part to {tag: Shazam}, an app that lets smartphone users identify and buy songs they hear on TV, the radio or out and about. Now Shazam is teaming up with media-services giant {tag: Mindshare} on a program called {tag: Audio+} that aims to really beef up the association of products and music. The details will be announced next week, but this news already has {host: Jim} questioning: where do we draw the line between art and commerce?

Admittedly, {host: Greg} has never really "gotten" the whole {artist: Robbie Williams} phenomenon. But now the British pop star has released the 1000th number one album in the {place: U.K.} Back in 1956 that {artist: Frank Sinatra}'s {album: Songs For Swingin' Lovers!} became the Brits' first #1. Now Robbie Williams's {album: Swings Both Ways} has become the 1,000th. 

## 00:09:55 List: Songs About the Music Business
{genre: Rock 'n' roll} is all about railing against the "man." And for musicians, there's no bigger man than the record business. Some songs celebrate music's great {tag: A&R} men and women or label heads. Many more skewer the suits. Here are {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}'s favorites:

### Jim
- {artist: Pink Floyd}, "{track: Have a Cigar}"
- {artist: Public Enemy}, "{track: Caught, Can I Get a Witness}"
- {artist: Patti Smith}'s cover of  "{track: So You Wanna Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star}"
- {artist: Local H}, "Laminate Man"

### Greg	
- {artist: Graham Parker}, "{track: Mercury Poisoning}"
- {artist: Aimee Mann}, "{track: Nothing is Good Enough}"
- {artist: Blackalicious}, "{track: Deception}"
- {artist: Sex Pistols}, "{track: E.M.I.}"

## 00:49:38 Review: The Warlocks
![Skull Worship](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/418/2AQ0.jpg)

{genre: Psychedelic} rockers {artist: The Warlocks} have undergone numerous shakeups and setbacks over the years, leaving many to wonder if the band would ever release new music. Yet, like a locomotive charging ever forward (a sound Jim likens to their music), The Warlocks just keep coming back. {host: Jim} is excited by the group's newest album, {album: Skull Worship}, finding its drones and incessant rhythms utterly hypnotizing. And while he admits the {genre: Shoegaze} sound doesn't break any new ground, he still thinks nobody is doing it better. Jim says {tag: Buy It}. {host: Greg} is less impressed by the album, [feeling](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-11-26/entertainment/chi-warlocks-album-review-20131126_1_bobby-hecksher-warlocks-guitars) that the pace is too slow. He admits there are moments of greatness (mainly towards the beginning of the album), but altogether {album: Skull Worship} isn't a complete success. Greg says {tag: Burn It}.
