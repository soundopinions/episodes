## 00:00:00 Classic Album Dissection : The Velvet Underground and Nico

One of our all-time favorite classic-album dissections, {album: The Velvet Underground and Nico},  a record that we think sounds as fresh, unique, and inspirational today as it did when it was released in March, 1967. Or, as Jim's rock-crit hero {name: Lester Bangs} put it: "Modern music begins with the Velvets, and the implications and influence of what they did seem to go on forever." We talk about the album and its many sonic innovations, and chart some of those influences, and as always, we look forward to having you along for the ride.
