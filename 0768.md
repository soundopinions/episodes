One of our all-time favorite classic-album dissections, {album: The Velvet Underground and Nico},  a record that we think sounds as fresh, unique, and inspirational today as it did when it was released in March, 1967. Or, as Jim's rock-crit hero {name: Lester Bangs} put it: "Modern music begins with the Velvets, and the implications and influence of what they did seem to go on forever." We talk about the album and {artist: The Velvet Underground}'s many sonic innovations, and chart some of those influences, and as always, we look forward to having you along for the ride.
