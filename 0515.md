![Spooner Oldham](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2015/spooneroldham_web.jpg)

As a keyboardist in the legendary recording studios of {place: Muscle Shoals}, {place: Alabama}, {artist: Spooner Oldham} wrote and played on dozens of classic hits from {artist: Aretha Franklin}, {artist: Percy Sledge}, and more. He joins {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} for a conversation. Then they review the new album from {artist: Janet Jackson}.


## 00:02:13 News: 10.09.15

{artist: Fetty Wap} tops the {tag: Billboard} 200 chart with the release of his self-titled debut. The album release follows the drops of his three top-ten singles, "{track: Trap Queen},"  "{track: 679}," and "{track: My Way}."  The rapper makes a splash as the first {genre: hip-hop} artist in two years to land a premiere album in the #1 spot since {artist: A$AP Rocky}'s {album: Long.Live.A$AP}.

The third time's the charm for {album: The Beatles}' {album: 1} album, which you might remember from its original release in 2000 or its second remastered release in 2011. The new {tag: three-disc} edition, out November 6, features promotional films and restored {tag: videos} of the group. {host: Greg} wonders how many times the same album can be resold to the same audience. Despite the lack of any real change in content, {host: Jim} predicts, "It'll debut at #1."

## 00:05:42 Interview: Spooner Oldham

Despite its location in a relatively obscure part of {place: the South}, {place: Muscle Shoals}, {place: Alabama} was home to some of the greatest studio musicians of the {era: 1960's} and {era: 1970's}. One of those pros was our guest {name: Spooner Oldham}, keyboardist and songwriter at {tag: FAME Studios}. Spooner played {tag: piano} and {tag: organ} on hits like "{track: Steal Away}" by {artist: Jimmy Hughes} and {artist: Percy Sledge}'s "{track: When a Man Loves a Woman}." Pretty soon, record executives from {place: the North} were sending artists down to record with the excellent house band at {tag: FAME}. Spooner provided the drive behind {artist: Wilson Pickett}'s "{track: Mustang Sally}," and even rescued a stagnating {artist: Aretha Franklin}  session by coming up with the iconic keyboard line for "{track: I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)}."

Along with his collaborator {name: Dan Penn}, {artist: Spooner Oldham} wrote huge hits like "{track: Cry Like a Baby}" by {artist: The Box Tops} and "{track: I'm Your Puppet}" by {artist: James & Bobby Purify}. After leaving Muscle Shoals, he played with {artist: Neil Young}, {artist: Bob Dylan}, {artist: Bobby Womack}, and more, and continues to perform with acts like {artist: Cat Power} and {artist: Drive-By Truckers}. In {era: 1972}, Spooner recorded his own album {album: Pot Luck}. It was largely forgotten except by cult record collectors, but now is being honored with an overdue reissue from {label: Light in the Attic}.


## 00:48:00 Review: Janet Jackson
![Unbreakable](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music49/v4/6b/55/0b/6b550b3c-1434-7727-6f99-42be970aa03b/4050538158328_Cover.jpg/600x600bb-85.jpg "1272779/1034128199")

For the first time in seven years, {artist: Janet Jackson} has released a new album called {album: Unbreakable}. At the beginning of her career, she faced the challenge of stepping out of the shadow of her older brothers, which she did with the help of {place: Minnesota} songwriters and producers {tag: Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis}. They worked together creating her signature {genre: rhythmic pop} sound on many of Janet's most famous albums, including {album: Control} and {album: Rhythm Nation 1814}, and teamed up again for *Unbreakable*. {host: Greg} thinks Jackson's last record, {era: 2008}'s {album: Discipline}, was probably her worst ever but she rebounded with a solid mid-career album. He appreciated that Janet stopped wasting her time with weak and overtly sexual material, and instead made music that is more true to her authentic self. Greg especially enjoyed the track "{track: BURNITUP!}," featuring one of his all-time favorite artists, {artist: Missy Elliott}. He gives the record a {tag: Buy It}. {host: Jim} agrees and highlights the strengths of Jam and Lewis' {genre: electronic}, modernized sound. He thinks Janet is as confident and talented as ever. It's a double {tag: Buy It} for *Unbreakable*.
