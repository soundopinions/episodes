## 00:04:39 News: 9.17.2010
Some of the biggest songs today haven't and never will hit radio airwaves. At last week's {tag: MTV} VMA's, {artist: Kanye West} debuted a song from his forthcoming album called "{album: Runaway}." It's packed full of radio-unfriendly words, but it's a surprising mea culpa from the notoriously arrogant rapper. Also surprising is {artist: Cee-Lo Green}'s kiss-off track "{track: F**k You}." Cee-Lo is known for his dark sense of humor, but not necessarily his anger. And these major stars are forced to release their music through unconventional means. It makes {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} wonder if terrestrial radio is a little out of touch.

## 00:09:19 Interview: White Mystery
One of the best parts of {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}'s jobs is that they get to discover great, new music, sometimes in their own backyards. Even better is when they can shine a spotlight on new bands on the show. This week they do just that. They're joined by {artist: White Mystery}, a young garage rock duo from {place: Chicago}. Sister and brother {name: Alex} and {name: Francis White} have been making music together since they were kids. Alex, 24, went on to front a number of bands, most notably {artist: Miss Alex White and the Red Orchestra}. They are, of course, being compared to that other famous White duo, but with Alex's massive screech and Francis' raw and dirty drumming, Greg hears more of a combo of Tina Turner and the MC5. What do you hear? Check out these live songs and [videos](http://www.wbez.org/story/wbez-blog/video-white-mystery-performs-take-walk-sound-opinions)

## 00:40:59 Review: John Legend and The Roots
![Wake Up!](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/aa/17/f0/aa17f0da-4db7-59ac-0b7a-dec10e3fed08/source/600x600bb.jpg "16586443/385274753")
During the Obama campaign {genre: R&B} {tag: singer} {artist: John Legend} and {genre: hip hop} group {artist: The Roots} were {tag: inspired} by the African-American community's rich tradition of socially conscious {tag: protest music}. So they decided to put together an album of covers of these funk, soul and reggae gems called {album: Wake Up!} Legend and The Roots really show their encyclopedic knowledge of music with their choices, which, {host: Greg} notes, are not the big hits by artists like {artist: Donny Hathaway} and {artist: Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes}. He appreciates that scholarship and hopes this will turn a new generation on to these artists. But, his main issue is that they don't transcend the original. So he gives Wake Up! a {tag: Burn It} rating. {host: Jim} has major problems with Legend's vocal performance, which doesn't match the emotional content of the songs. He wonders if he has a "tin ear" and gives the record a {tag: Trash It}.

## 00:48:47 DIJ: Greg
The last album inspired Greg to go back to the original version of "{track: Compared to What}." {tag: Vocalist} and {genre: jazz} {tag: pianist} {artist: Les McCann} paired up with {tag: saxophonist} {artist: Eddie Harris} at 1969's {place: Montreux Jazz Festival} to record their version of the {artist: Eugene McDaniel} song. It was first made famous by {artist: Roberta Flack}, but for Greg, McCann's take on the anti-Vietnam protest song is the most moving. He adds it to the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}.
