## 00:01:45 News: 11.27.2009
It's entirely possible that two of 2009's biggest hits will have come from reality TV stars. This week both {artist: Susan Boyle} from {tag: *Britain's Got Talent*} and {artist: Adam Lambert} from {tag: *American Idol*} have new albums out. While neither singer actually won his or her respective talent competition, both are poised to have huge hit debuts. Boyle has already broken Amazon's record for most pre-sales, and some sources predict sales in the millions. Lambert shocked some audiences at last week's {tag: American Music Awards}, but perhaps the controversial performance, or perhaps because of it, he could sell over 200,000 albums in his first week. Greg admires Lambert's attempt to break out of the pristine Idol mold, but doesn't think the record goes far enough.

## 00:09:11 List: Turkey Shoot 2009

## 00:37:26 Review: Rihanna
![Rated R: Remixed](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/f9/ea/fd/f9eafd5a-3c97-7690-a592-a1f4a91f9862/source/600x600bb.jpg "63346553/1168099672")
{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} review two new albums-are they triumphs or turkeys? First up is {album: Rated R}, the 4th album from {artist: Rihanna}. The pop singer blew up in 2007 with her song "{track: Umbrella}." She was recently in the news for an incident with boyfriend Chris Brown. While Brown was being sentenced for felony assault, Rihanna began working on Rated R. The result, for Greg, is surprisingly a record of substance. While Rihanna didn't write the songs, they are haunting and seem to directly address her abusive relationship. He never expected to say it, but Greg thinks this is one of the best records of the year. Jim agrees. He won't go so far as to compare the pop star to the towering voices of {artist: Mary J. Blige} and {artist: Aretha Franklin}, but Jim thinks Rated R is a record of empowerment. It gets a double {tag: Buy It} rating.

## 00:46:27 Review: Julian Casablancas
![Phrazes for the Young](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/a5/b2/9d/a5b29d88-3d13-5c3a-c0bd-878c87243985/source/600x600bb.jpg "560395/335804043")
{artist: The Strokes} debut {album: Is This It} was recently named the best album of the decade by {tag: NME}. Now the band's lead singer {artist: Julian Casablancas} has released his first solo record, {album: Phrazes for the Young}. This is a left turn for Casablancas, and rightly so, according to {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}. It wouldn't have been a good move to try to do a Strokes album without the band. But, none of the experimentation panned out for Jim. He really wanted to like this album, but it ended up being a real turkey. Greg agrees-the songs just aren't there. And neither is the tension between a strong rhythm section and Julian's dream vocals. {album: Phrazes for the Young} gets two {tag: Trash It}s.
