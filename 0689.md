![run](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2019/walkthisway.png)

{host : Jim} and {host : Greg} talk with author {tag : Geoff Edgers} about his 2019 book {tag : Walk This Way: Run-DMC, Aerosmith, and the Song that Changed American Music Forever}. They discuss how {artist : Run-DMC}'s 1986 collaboration with {artist : Aerosmith} came about and its impact. Plus, a review of {genre : soul}ful {genre : singer-songwriter}  {artist : Emily King}'s latest album, {album : Scenery}.



## 00:01:52 Interview: Geoff Edgers

By the {era : mid 1980s}, {artist : Aerosmith} was far from their 1970s heights. {artist : Run-DMC}, which consisted of rappers {artist : Joseph (Run) Simmons} and {artist : Darryl (DMC) McDaniels}, as well as {artist : Jammaster J}, was a young rap group with two solid selling albums under their belt. But, like nearly all of the {genre : hip hop} acts of the early '80s, they had yet to cross over into the mainstream.

Run-DMC and Aerosmith... two groups that couldn't be further apart musically, came together in 1986 to record "Walk This Way." The refreshed track ended up being a surprising hit for both bands. {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} talk with author {name : Geoff Edgers} who writes about this collaboration in his new book {tag : Walk This Way: Run-DMC, Aerosmith, and the Song that Changed American Music Forever}. The book gives the inside story of that collaboration and its lasting influence.



## 00:37:46 Review: Emily King

{genre : Singer-songwriter}  {artist : Emily King}'s third album in ten years, {album : Scenery}, is a departure from her earlier work. The {place : New York City} native went upstate to record this album and both {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} say she's found her voice as an artist. Greg calls King a "lithe vocalist" who deftly employs subtlety, rewarding close listening. She's hard to categorize as she moves between genres like {genre : soul}, {genre : funk}, {genre : gospel} and a little bit of {genre : rock}, but Greg calls that a strength. Jim has had a stressful week and appreciates the peace he's found in her music, calling it "wonderful, meditative, beautiful, seductive and peaceful." He says the key is "{track : Go Back}," a song he says is about commencement, moving from one part of her life to another.



## 00:49:30 Feature: Hooked On Sonics: Nothing

"It has been stuck with me forever" is how {name : Domenic Palermo}, founder of the band {artist : Nothing}, thinks of the track "{track : Plainsong}" from {artist : the Cure}. Palermo talked with Sound Opinions about "Plainsong" for our series {tag : Hooked on Sonics} where we talk with an artist about the song that got them interested in music. Palermo says he was first introduced to the song by his mom when he was about 10, but it wasn't until later in life that the lyrics truly spoke to him.



## 00:44:28 DIJ: Greg

This week, it's {host : Greg}'s turn to take a trip to the {tag : desert island jukebox} and play a song he can't live without. He celebrates the 20th anniversary of {artist : The Roots}' album {album : Things Fall Apart} by picking "{track : The Next Movement}." Greg notes that the {era : late '90s}/{era : early 2000s} were a golden era for {genre : hip hop}, combining conscious {genre : rap}pers like {artist : Common} and {artist : Black Thought} with singers like {artist : Erykah Badu} and {artist : D'Angelo}. This blend is brilliantly on display throughout Things Fall Apart, and particularly on the track "The Next Movement." Greg highlights lyrics that recognize the significance and rising popularity of black culture, and notes that every track on this record is solid as ever today.
