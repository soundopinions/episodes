## 00:01:49 Intro: Music News

What does it say about the music industry when 2011's highest-earning musician didn't release any new music? {artist : Dr. Dre} tops {tag : Forbes}' annual list of music industry earners with an income of $110 million, beating out industry heavyweights like {name : Bieber} and {name : Macca}. But fans are still waiting for {album : Detox} - Dre's highly anticipated follow up to 2001 and {album : The Chronic}. So how'd Dre do it? By selling a ton of headphones.

Throughout the year Jim and Greg have paid homage to the musical greats we've lost. There were some big names in 2012 - [{artist : Whitney Houston}](/show/325), [{artist : Etta James}](/show/322), [{artist : Levon Helm}](/show/335), {artist : Donna Summer}, and [{artist : Davy Jones}](/show/328) just to name a few. With the year coming to a close, Jim and Greg take a moment to recognize more artists they didn't get to earlier this year: {place : DC}'s own Godfather of Go-go {artist : Chuck Brown}, and Eastern music ambassador {artist : Ravi Shankar}. They play Brown's "{track : Bustin' Loose}" and Shankar's "{track : Dhun} (Fast Teental)" from the sitar master's 1967 {tag : Monterey Pop Festival} performance in appreciation.
