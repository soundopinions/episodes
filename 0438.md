# Show 438: ABBA at 40 & Eurovision

![ABBA](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2014/abba_web.jpg)

40 years of {artist: ABBA}! *ABBA Gold* author Elisabeth Vincentelli and {tag: Eurovision} expert John Kennedy O'Connor speak with Jim and Greg on the 40th anniversary of the sequined Swedes' breakthrough and {tag: Eurovision [Song Contest]} victory.

## 00:02:16 Intro: Music News
{tag: iTunes Radio} debuted with a great deal of fanfare last summer and was expected to be a dominant player in the streaming wars. According to a recent [Billboard](http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/6042224/underwhelming-start-to-itunes-radio-lights-fire-under) report, that fanfare might not have been deserved. Downloading, once a staple of the music consuming diet, is on the decline and streaming, for better or for worse, is up. {name: iTunes} plans on overhauling its strategy to compete with the market leaders of {name: Spotify} and {name: Pandora}, the latter of whom has grown by nine percent since the launch of {name: iTunes Radio}. 

## 00:04:54 Interview: John Kennedy O'Connor on Eurovision
The {tag: Eurovision Song Contest} is largely unknown to most Americans, but for much of the world, the annual songwriting contest is one the biggest (and occasionally, one of the most controversial) cultural events of the year. Like the {tag: Superbowl} meets {tag: American Idol} on steroids, the nearly 60-year old televised contest has grown to include more than 35 countries from in and around {place: Europe} duking it out to decide who has best original song. Each year an estimated 125 million people tune in to watch and it's their votes which determine who comes out on top. 

Despite the fervor before and during the contest, most Eurovision winners rarely go on to further success as artists - with few exceptions. Chief among those is {artist: ABBA}, who arguably wouldn't have become a {genre: pop} music powerhouse for 40 years if it weren't for their big break at Eurovision. To learn more about their musical birthplace, and just why it's so darn popular, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} recruited {name: John Kennedy O'Connor}, author of *[The Eurovision Song Contest: The Official History](http://www.amazon.com/The-Eurovision-Song-Contest-Official/dp/1847325211)*, to share the storied, and oftentimes strange, history of the annual music phenomenon. They'll all be tuning to watch this year's contest in Denmark on May 6th.

## 00:21:20 Interview: Elisabeth Vincentelli on ABBA

Forty years ago this month, {name: Anni-Frid [Lyngstad]} ({name: Frida [Lyngstad]}) Lyngstad, {name: Benny Andersson}, {name: Björn Ulvaeus}, and {name: Agnetha Fältskog} took the stage at {tag: Eurovision} {era: 1974}, decked out in platform shoes and sequined suits, to perform a new song called "{track: Waterloo}." {artist: ABBA} would become the first Swedish act to win the song contest. And while Eurovision winners rarely stay relevant, ABBA proved a huge exception, cranking out hit after hit in the {era: 1970s} before disbanding in 1983. But their legacy is complicated, explains {name: Elisabeth Vincentelli}. By day, she's the chief drama critic for the {tag: *New York Post*}. But by night she's an ABBA superfan who wrote a 33 1/3 book on {album: ABBA Gold}, the group's definitive best-of collection (and one of the top-selling albums in European history).

As Elisabeth reveals to {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}, there's way more to this band than just "{name: Dancing Queen}." Both Agnetha and Frida were well-known performers in {place: Sweden} before they married Benny and Björn and started ABBA (Agnetha was also an accomplisehd songwriter). Unfortunately, the two couples struggled to maintain their relationships in the limelight, leading to a downward spiral that Elisabeth likens to {album: Rumours}-era {artist: Fleetwood Mac} (with less tabloid coverage). Things finally fell apart in the early '80s. But a decade later, ABBA saw a strange resurgence among punk and gay subcultures, then among mainstream crowds, thanks to the {place: Australia}n dramedy {tag: *Muriel's Wedding*} and {tag: Broadway} smash {tag: *Mamma Mia!*}. The four members have all found success on their own, but Elisabeth has a bold prediction to make… Could an ABBA reunion could be in the works?
