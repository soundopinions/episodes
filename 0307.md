## 00:01:44 List: Hero Worship
Today's theme is {tag: Hero Worship}. The genesis of this idea was that we here at Sound Opinions started noticing that a lot of artists have written songs about their own heroes. Think of {artist: Bob Dylan}'s "{track: Song To Woody}." It's the kind of love only one rocker could express to another. Though when it comes to name-checking important musical figures, critics like {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} come a close second. Here are their favorite moments of musical Hero Worship.

### Jim
- {artist: The Replacements}, "{track: Alex Chilton}" 
- {artist: Television Personalities}, "{track: I Know Where Syd Barrett Lives}"
- {artist: Cheap Trick}, "{track: Surrender}"
- {artist: Robyn Hitchcock}, "{track: I Saw Nick Drake}"

### Greg
- {artist: Van Morrison}, "{track: Jackie Wilson Said (I'm in Heaven When You Smile)}"
- {artist: The Hold Steady}, "{track: Constructive Summer}"
- {artist: Frank Black}, "{track: I Heard Ramona Sing}"
- {artist: Stevie Wonder}, "{track: Sir Duke}"

## 00:43:32 Review: Van Hunt
![What Were You Hoping For?](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/4f/39/a0/4f39a09f-6cf8-4d23-95a6-185091eeba32/source/600x600bb.jpg "4247226/466755085")

After being cut loose from his major-label deal, {tag: singer}/{tag: songwriter} {artist: Van Hunt} has a new independently released album out called {album: What Were You Hoping For}. Jim and Greg received exactly what they were hoping for - a musically inventive album that doesn't fit into one particular genre. Van Hunt is finally free to let his freak flag fly, and fly it does. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} compare him to {artist: George Clinton} and {artist: Prince} and encourage you to {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:49:26 Review: Mastodon
![The Hunter](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/28/Mastodon-The_Hunter.jpg "65922937/463645173")
Some call {artist: Mastodon} the saviors of {genre: metal}. Others...hipster sellouts. But Jim and Greg just think they make terrific music. Combining a little {artist: Black Sabbath} with a little {artist: Melvins}, they are experimental and hard rocking without losing their sense of melody and harmony. Their new album {album: The Hunter} marks five successful releases in a row. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} say {tag: Buy It}.
