## 00:35:58 Feature: Instrumental: Bass VI
![Bass VI](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2017/bassVI.JPG)
In the latest installment of our {tag: Instrumental} segment, producer {name: Evan Chung} takes a look at the history of a lesser-known instrument that doesn't have a proper name – the {tag: Bass VI}. Once again, we get some help from {name: Daniel Escauriza} and {name: Shelby Pollard} of {place: Chicago Music Exchange} to demonstrate. The Bass VI is a hybrid six-string instrument that looks and feels like a guitar, but is tuned in the range of a bass. Sonically, the Bass VI features a sharp attack and a distinctive twangy sound.

{tag: Fender} released the most popular model, but the {tag: Danelectro} company put out the first version of the instrument in the 1950s. It then became a staple of {genre: country}, {genre: rockabilly}, and early {genre: rock 'n' roll}. In a style known as "{tag: tic-tac bass}," Nashville producers would use an upright bass _and_ a Bass VI simultaneously on recordings by {artist: Patsy Cline}, {artist: Ernest Tubb}, {artist: Roy Orbison}, and more. In the 1960s, it was a favorite tool of the {tag: Wrecking Crew} sessions musicians in LA, who used it on classic recordings with {artist: The Beach Boys} and {artist: Glen Campbell}.

Beginning in the 1980s, artists began to find new spookier uses for the Bass VI. {artist: New Order}, {artist: The Cure}, and {artist: The Cocteau Twins} all incorporated it into their sound. {name: Doug McCombs} has been the most prominent Bass VI player of the last few decades, featuring it in his work with {artist: Tortoise}, {artist: Eleventh Dream Day}, and {artist: Brokeback}. McCombs stopped by our studios to discuss his love of the instrument and to perform Brokeback's "{track: From the Black Current}" live.

## 00:50:55 Feature: Hooked On Sonics: Rise Against
![Rise Against](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2017/rise%20against.jpg)
"It sounded like {genre: punk}...liberated from the idea of what punk should or shouldn't sound like. And it was...powerful" is how {artist: Rise Against}'s singer and guitarist {name: Tim McIlrath} describes "{track: Waiting Room}" by {artist: Fugazi}, the song that got him {tag: Hooked on Sonics}. McIlrath talks about how Fugazi "shifted the direction of his life,"  got him making music and what he sees as his role to the next generation of {genre: hardcore} kids just discovering an underground music scene.
