# Show 503: Tame Impala Live and On Record 

![Tame Impala](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2015/tameimpala_web.jpg)

Led by multi-instrumentalist {name: Kevin Parker}, {place: Australia}n psych-rockers {artist: Tame Impala} made huge waves in both hemispheres with the release of their album {album: *Lonerism*} in 2012. They join Jim and Greg for a discussion and live performance. Then, Jim and Greg review the band's new release {album: *Currents*}.



## 00:02:14 News: 07.17.15

Since the mass shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in downtown {place: Charleston, South Carolina} earlier this summer, debate over the use of the {tag: Confederate flag} in {place: American} popular culture has become even more heated. The flag has been featured in {genre: rock} lyrics and performances for decades, most notably by the {place: Texas} {genre: heavy metal } band {artist: Pantera} in the {era: '90s} and also in performances by {artist: Tom Petty}, {artist: Blake Shelton}, and {artist: Zach Wild}. Musicians such as {artist: Kid Rock} and {name: Patterson Hood} of the {artist: Drive By Truckers} have joined the debate surrounding the flag, with Rock dismissing the issue and Hood criticizing the flag's continued presence in modern music and culture. 


{tag: Apple Music}, the new music streaming service from {tag: Apple}, launched on June 30th, making it yet another competitor in the global streaming market. In order to attract new users, Apple has offered a three month free trial to any iOS user interested in testing out the service for no cost before committing $10 a month for a subscription. While early reviews of the service have been mixed, two general complaints about Apple's latest innovation have emerged, including criticisms of its somewhat jumbled presentation and its lack of the social networking features that have made {tag: Spotify} such an attractive streaming option. {host: Jim} thinks we'll have to wait and see how many trial users decide to commit to the paid subscription to really get a sense of how Apple Music stacks up against its many fierce competitors.


## 00:08:05 Interview: Tame Impala
{place: Australia}n {genre: psychedelic} band {artist: Tame Impala} made a huge impact on the US with their 2012 album {album: *Lonerism*}. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} were particularly smitten with it, as the album took top slots on both critics' [Best of 2012](/show/367/) lists. Tame Impala stopped by our studios in 2013 for an interview and live performance. This week we're revisiting that conversation, just in time for the release of the band's new record {album: *Currents*}. Lead singer {name: Kevin Parker} talks about the band's influences, both expected ({artist: The Flaming Lips}) and not ({artist: Supertramp}), and his desire to work with producer {name: Dave Fridmann}. The musicians also debate whether actual psychedelic substances contribute to a psychedelic sound. Certainly you don't need them to enjoy the result.

On the heels of their 2013 appearance on Sound Opinions, listeners will hear a new sound with the new {artist: Tame Impala} album {album: *Currents*}. Lead singer {name: Kevin Parker} has taken the band in a new direction laden away from classic {genre: psychedlia} and towards sounds that previous albums didn't touch upon, namely {genre: Soul} and {genre: R&B}. {host: Greg} thinks this change in sound along with more pointed, introspective lyrics has led to a step forward for the band, especially in a live setting. He gives the album a {tag: Buy It}. Jim agrees and compares Parker to another pop auteur, {artist: Brian Wilson}. {host: Jim} thinks that the album displays Parker's ability to take different elements across the musical spectrum and make them orchestral and moving. He too gives {album: *Currents*} a {tag: Buy It} rating.

## 00:51:06 DIJ:  Greg
{host: Greg} has been enjoying the live return of the British punk band, {artist: The Mekons}. He in fact wanted to play a Mekons song, but Jim stole his thunder with his pick from show 191. Greg decided to play a track by Mekons offshoot band, {artist: The Three Johns}, featuring bon vivant {artist: Jon Langford}. Langford and company took the idea of protest music and gave it a twist, making it less precious. In honor of the {artist: Mekons} and Langford, Greg plays the track {track: Teenage Nightingales to Wax} this week.
