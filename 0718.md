## 00:25:00 Interview: Whitney
![Max and Julien](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/718/15O0.jpg)
In 2014, {name: Max Kakacek} and {name: Julien Ehrlich} were members of {artist: Smith Westerns}, touring extensively behind their third album, {album: Soft Will}. By the end of that year, the band had broken up and Max and Julien were hanging around cheap {place: Chicago} apartments, enduring a brutal winter. One day to amuse themselves they wrote a song together and recorded it. The results surprised them- the finished product ("{track: Dave's Song}") was too good to just be a joke. 

The duo kept at it, drawing on three main musical inspirations: {artist: The Band}, [{artist: Donnie and Joe Emerson}](https://vimeo.com/39424998) and [{artist: Amanaz}](https://www.okayafrica.com/zambia-music-zamrock-top-songs/). Julien and Max explain to {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} that {name: Levon Helm}'s singing and drumming, Donnie and Joe's male falsetto singing and Amanaz's soulful off-kilter guitar were all appealing to them. The synthesis of these sounds comes through clearly on {artist: Whitney}'s 2016 debut, {album: Light Upon the Lake}, which Jim describes as "classic {genre: indie rock} with a little {genre: Chicago soul}."

After the album's lead single, "{track: No Woman}," started to catch fire, the band was able to tour {place: Europe} multiple times. It was a far cry from their earliest tours, when the seven-piece band shared one ten-person tent (and Julien and bassist {name: Josiah Marshall} slept on bunk bed cots). 

Now the release date of their sophomore album, {album: Forever Turned Around}, has been declared "Whitney Day" by Chicago Mayor {name: Lori Lightfoot}. Julien tells Jim and Greg that on {album: Forever Turned Around} they were trying to evoke the constant state of flux many people feel now without being too much of a bummer.
