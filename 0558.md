# Show 558: Ska & Opinions on Jamila Woods

![Ska](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2016/ska_web.jpg)

In the late {era: 1950s}, {place: Jamaica}n musicians blended home-grown rhythms with {genre: R&B} to create {genre: ska}. The genre's influence quickly spread across the globe, paving the way for the {genre: reggae} phenomenon. Jim and Greg explore the history of ska from its island origins to its {place: British} revival to its most recent {genre: punk} incarnation. Plus, a review of the debut album from poet and {genre: soul} singer {artist: Jamila Woods}.


## 00:01:45 Genre Dissection: Ska
 {genre:  Ska} is an often misunderstood music genre. Isn't it the same as reggae? Didn't it die out in the '90s? Jim and Greg dig into ska in a Sound Opinions genre dissection with pioneering ska musician {artist: Charley Organaire} and Jump Up records founder and ska scholar {name: Chuck Wren}. Charley was present at the creation in 1950s {place: Jamaica} for what is now known as the 1st Wave of Ska. He tells us where the name came from and how the sound originated by mixing folk music known as {genre: mento} with American {genre: R&B}, giving rise to artists like {artist: The Skatalites}, {artist: Prince Buster} and {artist: Laurel Aiken}. Then Chuck leads us through the 2nd Wave, or {label: Two-Tone}, movement in the late '70s {place: England} with bands like {artist: The Specials}, {artist: Madness} and {artist: The English Beat}. And finally the 3rd Wave breaks in the United States in the 1990s with an aggressive strain of punk-infused ska that looked to be reaching the mainstream, only to fade away as quickly as it grew. But Chuck tells us that ska can still be found all over the world. 

## 00:42:47 Review: Jamila Woods

In the last few years, {place: Chicago} poet and {genre: soul} artist {artist: Jamila Woods} has made memorable cameos on tracks by {artist: Macklemore and Ryan Lewis}, {artist: Chance the Rapper}, {artist: Donnie Trumpet}, and more. Now, she's breaking out with her debut album {album: HEAVN}. {host: Jim} loves how Jamila effortlessly blends genres like soul, {genre: R&B}, and {genre: hip hop}. He also finds her lyrics to be powerful and effective in painting a picture of her life as a black woman. Jim thinks Woods is elevating the {genre: neo soul} genre to the next level and gives {album: HEAVN} a {tag: Buy It}. {host: Greg} wholeheartedly agrees, and thinks this album is another great release coming from the Chicago hip hop and R&B scene. He greatly respects Jamila's ability to poetically articulate her struggles against society's perceptions of black beauty and womanhood. Overall, Greg thinks this is one of the best albums of the year so far, and gives it an enthusiastic {tag: Buy It}.


## 00:50:25 DIJ: Jim
   For {host: Jim}'s {tag: Desert Island Jukebox} pick this week, he chooses {track: She's Like Heroin To Me} by {artist: The Gun Club}. {name: Jeffrey Lee Pierce} and the other founders of this band played music that did not fit into any genre labels but which might be described as "{genre: psychobilly} {genre: cowpunk} {genre: post-punk} {genre: tribal}-{genre: psychobilly}-{genre: blues}." Jim reminisces about the very innovative period of {genre: indie rock} and {genre: punk} in the {era: '80}s when The Gun Club came about, and points out how important this particular track is in understanding '80s music and expressing popular punk themes like obsession, addiction, and sex.
