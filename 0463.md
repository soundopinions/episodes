# Show 463: The Both & Opinions on Weezer

![theboth](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2014/theboth_web.jpg)

After finding surprising inspiration in {artist: Thin Lizzy} in a hotel room, veteran singer-songwriters {name: Aimee Mann} and {name: Ted Leo} joined forces to form {artist: The Both}. Tune in for a conversation and live performance. Later Rivers Cuomo and Weezer are back with a new album.


## 00:02:14 Intro: Music News
It has been an historic few weeks for aging rockers on the {tag: Billboard} charts. First, at age 88, {artist: Tony Bennett} broke his own record as the oldest living artist to have a #1  record with {album: Cheek to Cheek}, his duet with {artist: Lady Gaga}. Then, we have diva {artist: Barbra Streisand} with her own duet album {album: Partners}. The success of her latest endeavor makes her the only artist to have a #1 album in each of the past six decades.
 
Just when you thought concert tickets couldn't get more expensive, they just might. Independent concert and event promotion company, {tag: C3 Presents} will reportedly sell 51% of the company to {tag: Live Nation}. C3 is responsible for events like {tag: Lollapalooza} and {tag: Austin City Limits Music Festival}. A collaboration with "Death Star" Live Nation would greatly increase that company's stake in the {place: U.S.} concert market and possibly lead to higher ticket prices for you the concertgoer.
 
Which designer has English {genre: indie} {genre: pop} band {artist: The xx} in a fury? {tag: Hugo Boss} recently used a song in its new ad campaign--one that sounds strikingly similar to "{track: Intro}" by The xx. The band is extremely unhappy, calling the song "a poorly designed fake." Perhaps Hugo Boss should stick to designing clothes.

## 00:07:41 Interview: The Both
{name: Ted Leo} and {name: Aimee Mann} seem like an unlikely pairing: he's {genre: punk}, she's {genre: folk}, but as {artist: The Both}, the duo make beautiful music together. And inspiration for forming this "mutual admiration society" came from some strange places including Twitter and a shared love of comedy and {artist: Thin Lizzy}. And the project seems to have been liberating for both musicians--freeing them up from their typecast constraints of "political rocker" or "singer-songwriter." Ted and Aimee perform songs from The Both's self-titled debut, including a celebration of "{track: Milwaukee}" and its utterly bizarre "{tag: Bronze Fonz}."

## 00:44:15 Review: Weezer
![Everything Will Be Alright In the End](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/463/21R0.jpg)
Alternative heroes {artist: Weezer} are back with a new album, but {host: Greg} says you'd be forgiven if you thought it was {era: 1994} all over again. Back in {era: 2010}, Weezer frontman {name: Rivers Cuomo} sat down with Jim and Greg to defend his material against claims of pandering to fans. Greg respects Cuomo, but that doesn't change the fact that he thinks the singer is doing it all over again on Weezer's latest, {album: Everything Will Be Alright in the End}. Greg encourages Cuomo not be bothered so much by what he thinks his fans want more of: emotional guitar riffs and faintly wise musings on life and love. Instead, he should just stick with what he does best: crafting pleasurable {genre: pop} melodies and hooks that feel good and aren't out to change the world.  *Everything Will Be Alright in the End* is a {tag: Try It} for Greg. {host: Jim} isn't as bothered by Weezer's obvious pining for the past. Yes, you should probably ignore the record's reaching thematic bent (an exploration of Cuomo's relationship with fans, females and his father), but don't discount the song's genius hooks and offbeat subject matter. *Everything Will Be Alright in the End* is just plain fun, and the best Weezer album since 2000's *The Green Album*.  Jim says {tag: Buy It}. 


## 00:50:20 DIJ: Greg
{place: Idaho}-native {name: Paul Revere} of the {era: 1960}'s colonial-garbed band {artist: Paul Revere and the Raiders} passed away this week from cancer, so {host: Greg} chooses to remember the ringleader of the raucous band by taking their song "{track: Louie, Go Home}" with him to the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}. The {era: 1964} single is a response to {artist: The Kingsmen}'s 1963 song "{track: Louie Louie}"--one they put together after relocating from {place: Idaho} to Kingsmen territory in the {place: Pacific Northwest}. The tongue-in-cheek track would later go on to be recorded by {artist: David Bowie} (still known then as {name: David Jones}), {artist: The Who}, {artist: Joan Jett} and more.
