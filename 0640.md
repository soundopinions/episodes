## 00:01:31 Review: Black Panther Soundtrack
![Black Panther The Album Music From And Inspired By](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/640/2J0.jpg)
The film {album: Black Panther} has broken all sorts of box office records, but its the soundtrack that has caught Jim and Greg's attention. Helmed by {artist: Kendrick Lamar}, the album features a stars like {artist: SZA}, {artist: the Weeknd} and {artist: Anderson Paak}; but Greg notes that lesser known artists like singer {artist: Jorja Smith} and {place: South African} rapper {artist: Yugen Blakrock} are "the real revelation" here. Greg says Blakrock goes toe to toe and holds her own against {artist: Vince Staples} on {track: Opps}. He adds that producer {artist: Sounwave} contributes a "haunted" Carribean sound. Jim loves the "musical variety: {genre: R&B}, {genre: rap}, {genre: afro soul}, and {genre: South African pop}.  He notes that though the album isn't as closely connected to the film as {artist: Curtis Mayfield}'s {era: 1972} classic {album: Super Fly}, it is "a wonderful companion to the film". {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} give the album a double {tag: Buy It}.
