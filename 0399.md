## 00:01:47 Intro: Music News
*You* can't always get what you want, but that doesn't mean {artist: The Rolling Stones} can't. {tag: Billboard} reports that the band recently grossed $21.3 million in just five concerts on their "50 & Counting Tour." Not bad for a bunch of rockers pushing 70. This tour also saw {artist: The [Rolling] Stones}' return to {place: London}'s revered {place: Hyde Park} venue. Forty-four years after their free concert honoring {name: Brian Jones}, the band performed to a crowd of 60,000 paying customers. Clearly {artist: The [Rolling] Stones} can still bring out the crowds, but can they deliver the musical goods? {host: Greg}'s answer is a hesitant "yes." He caught them in {place: Chicago} and admits that while he wishes they'd throw more surprises into the set-list, the boys can still play.

## 00:04:12 Interview: Johnny Marr
{artist: Johnny Marr} is something of a serial collaborator. First, there's his most famous partnership: with {name: Morrissey} in {artist: The Smiths}. Then there's {name: Bernard Sumner}, {artist: Billy Bragg}, {artist: Bert Jansch}, {artist: The Cribs} and {artist: Modest Mouse}. So perhaps we shouldn't be surprised that it took three decades for him to go solo. On {album: The Messenger} Marr isn't afraid to harken back to his {artist: [The] Smiths} sound. Mostly, he explains to {host: Jim}and {host: Greg}, he thought about all the fans he meets at shows (all but one [fan](http://www.nme.com/news/the-smiths/70703)). He admits that some of the lyrical [content](http://www.lyricsty.com/johnny-marr-new-town-velocity-lyrics.html) isn't that far from the songs he wrote as a lad, but lucky for us he was weened on great guitar pop from {artist: T. Rex}. Greg asks Marr about the almost insane decision to quit {artist: The Smiths} at the height of their fame. But he insists that the band wouldn't have lasted another two weeks; musically, they achieved everything they could. That's not to diminish the band. He also credits them with inventing ["indie."](http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2013/jan/11/johnny-marr-smiths-morrissey-politics-pop)

## 00:43:18 Review: Run The Jewels
![Run The Jewels](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/399/2060.jpg)

Last year we got {artist: El-P}'s {album: Cancer 4 Cure} and {album: R.A.P. Music}, the album he produced for {artist: Killer Mike}. Now the two come together again to form {artist: Run the Jewels} and release a self-titled album. {host: Greg} hears the two rappers "blowing off steam." But that shouldn't suggest {album: Run The Jewels} is a blow-off. It's like breathless, old-school battle rapping with great beats to boot. He says {tag: Buy It}. {host: Jim} admits {name: El-P} is a genius {tag: producer}, but is disappointed by the lyrical content. He hears lazy smack talk about nothing. So while {album: Run the Jewels} is free, it's still a {tag: Try It}.

## 00:50:09 DIJ: Greg
{host: Greg} paraglides into the desert island this week with a nod to his past. Just as {host: Jim} recalled a "summer song" last week, Greg remembers listening to AM radio in his parents' kitchen. The station was playing the 500 greatest songs of all time, and "{track: House of the Rising Sun}" by {artist: The Animals} hit him like a bolt. Many have recorded their own versions, but no one did it like {artist: The Animals} and {tag: vocalist} {name: Eric Burdon}.
