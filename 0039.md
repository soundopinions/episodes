## 00:02:49 Review: Bob Dylan
![Modern Times](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music3/v4/d6/18/4c/d6184c08-5763-b157-c2aa-9b0ef95bba6c/dj.fixwbqei.jpg/600x600bb-85.jpg "462006/187497036")

As fall approaches, record companies begin to roll out some of the year's biggest albums in time for the holidays. This week, Jim and Greg review some of the most notable, including the 44th studio release from {genre: rock} veteran {artist: Bob Dylan}. {album: Modern Times} is actually not a very modern album at all. In fact, Dylan recently dissed all of the music of the past 20 years, including that made by his [son](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakob_Dylan/). Rather, he opted to record this music in a {genre: lo-fi} style reminiscent of the music of the {era: '30s} and {era: '40s}. {host: Jim} appreciated Dylan's ever-growing sense of [humor](http://www.moron.nl/lyrics/bob-dylan/thunder-on-the-mountain-lyrics.html) and irony, but couldn't take some of the tracks' {artist: Bing Crosby}/{artist: Rudy Vallée} style of crooning. He gives it a {tag: Burn It}. {host: Greg} doesn't think that {album: Modern Times} is as good as Dylan's previous two releases, possibly because the band seems to be intimidated by their leader, but this effort still merits a {tag: Buy It}. 

## 00:13:20 Review: Audioslave
![Revelations](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/84/54/d2/8454d2ce-48bc-ff2d-ecc6-d0f3bc65fe3c/source/600x600bb.jpg "825191/396134092")
{artist: Audioslave}, the best-selling {genre: rock} act of the decade, released its third album this week. The band is composed of remnants of successful {era: '90s} bands: Lead singer {name: Chris Cornell}, formerly of {artist: Soundgarden}, is joined by {artist: Rage Against the Machine}'s {name: Tim Commerford}, {name: Brad Wilk}, and super-guitarist/activist {name: Tom Morello}. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} are both big fans of Morello as a person and a musician, but they can't find much redeeming about {artist: Audioslave}. At least on this album, {album: Revelations}, there appears to be an effort to politicize the music's content. However, it still lacks substance, and the music itself is formulaic. Both hosts give {album: Revelations} a {tag: Trash It}. In fact, Jim says if he had four copies, he'd trash all of them. Greg adds that there's only one revelation here—"that this band is really bad." 

## 00:21:46 Review: Kelis
![Kelis Was Here](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/63/88/5b/63885bcb-4490-42d8-e7d4-fc5392d895f2/source/600x600bb.jpg "772086/306827864")
{artist: Kelis} scored a big hit with her {era: 2003} single "{track: Milkshake}," and this week she tries to do it again. {album: Kelis Was Here} is the {genre: R&B} singer's first album since splitting from former collaborators {artist: The Neptunes} and marrying rapper {artist: Nas}. Our hosts are split on their opinions. {host: Jim} is happy to see Kelis working with a variety of producers, including {name: Scott Storch} and {name: Will.I.Am}, and is glad that her sexual self-empowerment remains intact. The album earns a {tag: Buy It} from him. {host: Greg} finds this record to be pretty generic, though, contending that all of the producers have buffed her personality out. He describes {album: Kelis Was Here} as "milkshake leftovers," and only gives it a {tag: Burn It}.

## 00:31:22 Review: Cursive
![Happy Hollow](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/51/cb/a0/51cba0dd-7c5b-5d49-0519-a5949e3b955b/source/600x600bb.jpg "150633966/1187460923")
Switching gears, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} next discuss {album: Happy Hollow}, the latest release from {place: Omaha} {genre: indie rock} group {artist: Cursive}. At first they were concerned that the band, and frontman {name: Tim Kasher}, were merely like the younger brothers of fellow Omaha {genre: emo} outfit {artist: Bright Eyes}. But Kasher and co. have proved themselves to be really adventurous songwriters and musicians, more in the {genre: New Wave} tradition than the {name: Conor Oberst} tradition. Both Jim and Greg give {album: Happy Hollow} a {tag: Buy It}, though they hope the band gets better live.

## 00:42:38 Review: The Roots
![Game Theory (Bonus Track Version)](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music49/v4/30/55/94/305594f2-6441-dc20-0c11-dac2e4b4100d/source/600x600bb.jpg "43680/183134942")
{place: Philadelphia} {genre: hip-hop} group {artist: The Roots} have an album up for review entitled {album: Game Theory}. The rappers and musicians largely changed the way hip-hop was perceived by incorporating live instrumentation and {genre: rock}-style jams into their recordings and performances. {host: Greg} has always been a fan, and loves songs like the dark track "{track: In the Music}," but doesn't think the record is consistent enough. There's an entire eight minutes of music dedicated to the recently departed producer {name: J Dilla} that he can't really excuse—so he gives it a {tag: Burn It}. {host: Jim} believes {album: Game Theory} is the best record the group has done since {era: 1999}'s {album: Things Fall Apart}. He loves the dark tone of the record and emotional content of the lyrics, and doles out a {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:51:08 Review: M. Ward
![Post-War](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/db/4d/69/db4d6974-cc6b-ace5-7eed-de8f063f6298/source/600x600bb.jpg "1209107/171852155")
The final album under scrutiny this week is by singer/songwriter {name: Matt Ward}, aka {artist: M. Ward}. Ward is a rather beloved member of the {genre: indie rock} community and has collaborated with everyone from {artist: Death Cab for Cutie}'s {name: Ben Gibbard}, to {name: Jenny Lewis}, to the aforementioned {name: Conor Oberst}. {album: Post-War} is his fifth album since being "discovered" by {name: Jason Lytle} ([a recent guest on the show](show/37/)). {host: Jim} enjoys about half of the album, including a cover of {artist: Daniel Johnston}'s anti-war song "{track: To Go Home}," but says the other half "sucks." He finds it pretentious and pointlessly eclectic and can only give {album: Post-War} a {tag: Burn It}. {host: Greg}, however, loves that Ward knows how to create atmosphere. He finds it a beautiful record that sucks you in from beginning to end, earning a definite {tag: Buy It}.
