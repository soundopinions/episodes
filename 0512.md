# Show 512: Wire, Blackalicious, & Low

![wire](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2015/wire_web.jpg)

Ever since they formed in 1977, experimental art-punk band Wire has had a tremendous influence on music. And unlike most first wave punks, the group continues to release challenging music into the 21st century. Wire joins Jim and Greg for a special live performance and interview.



## 00:02:23 Intro: Music News

{artist : Whitney Houston} is just the latest in a series of deceased musicians who have been made into {tag : holograms} in order to tour around the world. Other famous holograms include {artist : Tupac}, {artist : Buddy Holly}, {artist : Liberace} and {artist : Roy Orbison} but this isn't anything new for the entertainment industry. For years, images of {artist : Elvis Presley} and even {artist : Frank Sinatra} were shown in concerts singing along with a live band and performers. And while the joke is that death is a great career move, {host : Jim} finds it interesting that it is no longer an impediment to touring. Who would you like to see as a hologram or do you think the whole thing is just too weird?

Back in {era : 1972}, {artist : Aretha Franklin} recorded one of the great {genre : gospel} albums of all time, {album : *Amazing Grace*}. In {era : 2012}, {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} even did a [{tag : Classic Album Dissection}](/show/332/#amazinggrace) on the live record because it was so good and so iconic. Famous director {name : Sydney Pollack} (*Tootsie*, *Out of Africa*) filmed the concert back in the {era : '70s} and now more than 40 years later, two major film festivals were finally supposed to show the movie. However, Aretha took legal action to block the film festivals from presenting it. Apparently she loves the film but Greg suspects this whole thing has something to do with money. This one may drag on, but Greg and Jim really hope that they sort things out because this is a true piece of musical history.

## 00:07:51 Interview: Wire

This week our guests are the {genre : art punk} innovators, {artist : Wire}. Their first album, {album : *Pink Flag*}, catapulted the band to critical success in {era : 1977} with its unusual song structures with shifting bursts of sound. Over the years, Wire has refused to stop making new and different music, at times refusing to even play older material live. After that incredible first trilogy of albums, {album : *Pink Flag*}, {album : *Chairs Missing*}, and {album : *154*}, they took some time off and reemerged in {era : 1987} with a very different sound. That phase lasted until the {era : early '90s} and the band again went away. But in {era : 2003}, they reunited again for a third phase of their career that is still going strong. They released their 14th studio album this year, which showed up on [Jim's midyear best-of list](/show/498/#wire)

{host : Jim} and {host : Greg} were lucky enough to host a special performance and conversation with Wire in front of an audience at the Goose Island Barrelhouse in Chicago. The current lineup includes guitarist {name : Colin Newman}, bassist {name : Graham Lewis}, and the very soft-spoken drummer {name : Robert Grey}, all of whom were with the band at the beginning. But Jim started out the interview by asking the newest member of the group, guitarist {name : Matthew Simms}, about how he got the call inviting him to join the band.



## 00:40:32 Review: Blackalicious

![Imani, Vol. 1](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/512/1VK0.jpg)

{place : Sacramento}  {genre : rap} duo {artist : Blackalicious} has had a huge influence on {genre : hip-hop} over the past twenty years, crafting a more {genre : psychedelic}  {place : Northern California} sound than their {place : LA} counterparts. {album : Imani Vol. 1} is their first album in a decade and, to {host : Jim}'s ears, they haven't lost a step. Jim praises the complex, philosophical rhymes of {name : Gift of Gab} as he explores themes of perseverance and faith. Producer {name : Chief Xcel} continues to bring in sounds from across genres to create dense but accessible backgrounds. {host : Greg} appreciates that Blackalicious is picking up where they left off, not making a forced attempt at modernizing their sound. The record maintains the optimism and spirituality always present in their music, while also addressing the continuing struggles faced by African-Americans. Both critics are glad to have them back and give *Imani Vol. 1* a {tag : Buy It}.



## 00:48:46 Review: Low

![Ones and Sixes](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/512/29A0.jpg)

{place : Duluth}, {place : Minnesota} trio {artist : Low} has been making hushed, minimal music since 1993, leading critics to dub their sound "{genre : slowcore}" over the band's objections. ([Low stopped by the studios back in 2011](/show/286/)). For their eleventh album {album : Ones and Sixes}, the band  headed to the {place : Eau Claire}, {place : Wisconsin} studio of {artist : Bon Iver}'s {name : Justin Vernon}. {host : Greg} cringes when people think of Low as mellow and soothing – the music may be quiet, but it's also  *disquieting*, often reaching into dark, even apocalyptic, places. He loves how the band consistently finds new directions to take its sound even while working within the same palette, this time adding texture with electronic static and quaking bass lines. *Ones and Sixes* doesn't have the same amount of dynamic contrast as some previous records, so it took a while for {host : Jim} to warm up to it. But after repeated listens, he now counts it as one of his favorite Low albums. That makes it an enthusiastic double-{tag : Buy It} from both critics.
