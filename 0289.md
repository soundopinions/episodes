## 00:49:39 Review: Raphael Saadiq 
![Stone Rollin' - Single](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/289/2AR0.jpg)

{artist: Raphael Saadiq} is a music veteran at age 44. He was a member of the successful {genre: R&B} group {artist: Tony! Toni! Toné!} and then {artist: Lucy Pearl}. Now he's released his fourth solo album called {album: Stone Rollin'}. Jim loves the vibe of it, even {name: Robert Randolph}'s {tag: pedal steel guitar}. You could accuse Saadiq of living in the past–he makes no bones about his roots–but he has the songwriting chops to put behind it. {host: Jim} gives this "great party record" a {tag: Buy It}. {host: Greg} has always respected and liked Saadiq, but on this album he falls in love. He calls this album the singer/songwriter's crowning achievement, adding that Saadiq falls on the right side of the divide between retro and classic. *Stone Rollin'* gets a double {tag: Buy It}.
