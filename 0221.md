## 00:01:50 News: 2.19.2010
Proving the adage that everyone is a critic, the {place: Vatican} has released its first official {tag: Top Ten List} of albums. The official Vatican paper, {tag: *L'Osservatore Romano*}, has endorsed records by {artist: Oasis}, {artist: The Beatles}, {artist: Michael Jackson} and {artist: Fleetwood Mac}. And perhaps for the title alone, they also included {artist: Carlos Santana}'s {album: Supernatural}. It made a point of not including {artist: Bob Dylan}, however, on the grounds that generations of less-talented Dylan acolytes have "harshly tested the ears and patience of listeners with their inferior imitations, thinking that their tortured meanderings might interest somebody."

In other music news, {genre: rock} {tag: producer} {name: Ian Burgess} {tag: passed away} last week. As {host: Jim} explains, Burgess was one of the architects of the hyper-aggressive, yet melodic, {genre: indie rock} sounds of the {era: 1980's}. He worked with a number of {place: Midwest} bands such as {artist: Naked Raygun}, {artist: Pegboy} and {artist: Big Black}. He also served as a mentor to Big Black founder-turned {tag: producer} {name: Steve Albini}. To honor Burgess, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} play "{track: I Don't Know}" off Naked Raygun's 1985 album {album: Throb Throb}.

## 00:06:56 Interview: Rivers Cuomo

During our feature segment {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} are joined by {artist: Weezer} lead singer {name: Rivers Cuomo}. However, it's not Weezer that accompanies him. It's the {place: Chicago} {genre: rock} band {artist: The Cathy Santonies}. Before visiting the studio, Rivers asked Jim and Greg to choose his songs and choose his backing band. Then after a brief sound check, they launched in completely unrehearsed. It's a return to Rivers' garage rock roots that preceded Weezer's massive {era: 1994} self-titled debut. He and the band have gone on to record a number of successful albums since then. But, as he explains to Jim and Greg, life as a musician has not been without conflict. In fact, Rivers Cuomo might be one of the most angst-ridden front men out there. Whether it's being accused of being too soft ({album: Pinkerton}) or too much of a sellout ({album: The Red Album}), Rivers has always had his critics. Despite that, he seems to be having fun, especially when rocking out. 

The Cathy Santonies are {tag: guitarist}-{tag: vocalist} {name: Mojo Santoni}, {tag: bassist}-{tag: vocalist} {name: Radio Santoni}, {tag: guitarist} {name: Jane Danger} and {tag: drummer} {name: Kaylee Preston}. They are named after an often talked about but never seen character on {tag: *Full House*}. 

## 00:49:36 Review: Yeasayer
![Odd Blood](//static.soundopinions.org/assets/221/2AO0.jpg "264143704/953194489")
The record review this week is of {album: Odd Blood} by {artist: Yeasayer}. The {place: Brooklyn}-based band released their highly-acclaimed debut in 2007. And like {artist: Weezer}, they faced the dreaded sophomore album pressure. But, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} agree that they deliver. Jim has already nominated "{track: Madder Red}" for hook of the year. Yeasayer has upped the songwriting on Odd Blood, but Greg wishes they had maintained the mystery and allure of the last record. He hears some obvious references and hopes they don't go too far in the pop direction on their next release. That said, Odd Blood gets a double {tag: Buy It}.
