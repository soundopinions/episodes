# Show 895: Dry Cleaning, Reviews of Margo Price and SZA, and RIP Jeff Beck

Post-punk tunes topped with dadaist deadpan lyrics are an unlikely formula for popularity in music, but that's the secret to Dry Cleaning's success. Hosts Jim DeRogatis and Greg Kot talk with band members Florence Shaw and Nick Buxton about one of their favorite albums of 2022. They also review new albums by SZA and Margo Price and pay tribute to Jeff Beck.Join our Facebook Group: https://bit.ly/3sivr9TBecome a member on Patreon: https://bit.ly/3slWZvcSign up for our newsletter: https://bit.ly/3eEvRnGMake a donation via PayPal: https://bit.ly/3dmt9lUSend us a Voice Memo: Desktop: bit.ly/2RyD5Ah  Mobile: sayhi.chat/soundopsFeatured SongsDry Cleaning, "Don't Press Me," Stumpwork, 4AD, 2022SZA, "Shirt," SOS, Top Dawg, 2022SZA, "Nobody Gets Me," SOS, Top Dawg, 2022SZA, "Kill Bill," SOS, Top Dawg, 2022SZA, "Gone Girl," SOS, Top Dawg, 2022Margo Price, "Been To The Mountain," Strays, Loma Vista, 2023Margo Price, "Radio," Strays, Loma Vista, 2023Margo Price, "Time Machine," Strays, Loma Vista, 2023Margo Price, "Lydia," Strays, Loma Vista, 2023Margo Price, "Change of Heart," Strays, Loma Vista, 2023Dry Cleaning, "Magic of Meghan," Sweet Princess, It's OK, 2019Dry Cleaning, "Scratchcard Lanyard," New Long Leg, 4AD, 2021Dry Cleaning, "Unsmart Lady," New Long Leg, 4AD, 2021Dry Cleaning, "Anna Calls From The Artic," Stumpwork, 4AD, 2022Dry Cleaning, "No Decent Shoes For Rain," Stumpwork, 4AD, 2022The Yardbirds, "Shapes of Things," (Single), Epic, 1966Jeff Beck, "Beck's Bolero," Truth, Epic, 1968The Kinks, "People Take Pictures of Each Other," The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society, Pye, 1968
