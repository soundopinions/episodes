# Show 895: Dry Cleaning, Reviews of Margo Price and SZA, and RIP Jeff Beck

Post-punk tunes topped with dadaist deadpan lyrics are an unlikely formula for popularity in music, but that's the secret to Dry Cleaning's success. Hosts Jim DeRogatis and Greg Kot talk with band members Florence Shaw and Nick Buxton about one of their favorite albums of 2022. They also review new albums by SZA and Margo Price and pay tribute to Jeff Beck.

{name: Florence Shaw} and {name: Nick Buxton} of {artist: Dry Cleaning} join the show for a wide-ranging interview. The British post-punk band is notable both for their dada approach to lyrics and their rapid ascent in the UK music scene, counting Iggy Pop, Simon LeBon and John Parish among their fans. Their 2022 album, {album: Stumpwork}, was Jim's favorite album of the year (and a favorite of Greg's, too).
