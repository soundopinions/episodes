## 00:01:45 News: 3.12.2010
After a number of postponements, {artist: Lil Wayne} has finally had his day in court. And the results weren't pretty. The multi-million selling rapper has been sentenced to one year in {tag: prison}, and not the kinda digs most wealthy criminals face, but {place: Riker's Island}. This is the result of Wayne pleading guilty to {tag: gun possession} last year. In an absurd chain of events, both of his previous sentencing dates had to be postponed–first because of "emergency dental surgery," and then because the courthouse went up in flames. {host: Greg} likens Lil Wayne's situation to if {artist: Elvis} or {artist: The Beatles} had been jailed at the height of their chart success, and {host: Jim} wonders how fair this sentence really is.

Also in the news, {name: Mark Linkous}, aka {artist: Sparklehorse}, committed {tag: suicide} last week at age {tag: 47}. Linkous had been battling severe depression for years, and his use of prescription drugs even left him paralyzed for several months. As Jim explains, Linkous used his life challenges in his music, and a new collaboration between the {tag: singer} and {artist: Danger Mouse} was set to be released this summer. To honor Linkous, Jim and Greg play "{track: Grim Augury}," a track from that album that also features another recently departed musician, {artist: Vic Chesnutt}.

## 00:09:31 Interview: Mickey Leigh
{name: Joey Ramone} is one of rock's biggest legends, but very little is known about his actual life. As we learn in the next segment, {artist: the Ramones'} {tag: lead singer}, born {name: Jeffry Hyman}, had a turbulent life full of physical and mental illness. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} get insight into his life from the punk rocker's brother, {name: Mickey Leigh}, author of the new book {tag: *I Slept With Joey Ramone*}. They are also joined by the book's contributor and {tag: Punk Magazine} co-founder {name: Legs McNeil}. As Mickey reveals to Jim and Greg, this is not a fairy tale. Joey suffered from {tag: obsessive-compulsive disorder} and was diagnosed as a {tag: schizophrenic} in his teens. But it's an uplifting tale. Through music Joey was able to laugh at the dark areas of life and even overcome some of his insecurities. He became a beacon of hope to awkward kids everywhere–if Joey can do it, we can do it.

## 00:35:29 Review: Gorillaz
![Plastic Beach (Deluxe Version)](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music6/v4/3a/85/b3/3a85b3d7-b609-d84b-3dab-ee0b088f1e76/source/600x600bb.jpg "567072/720197924")
Kicking off the reviews this episode is {album: Plastic Beach}, the latest from {artist: Gorillaz}. The project is helmed by {name: Damon Albarn} of {artist: Blur} and features a cast of guests to create its animated fantasy world. {host: Greg} is impressed at how the {tag: singer}/{tag: producer} can bring together so many seemingly mismatched elements, sounds and voices and still end up with something wonderful and cohesive. Greg gives Plastic Beach a {tag: Buy It} rating. {host: Jim} goes so far as to call Albarn a genius. He notes that it's a darker record, but gives it a Buy It as well.

## 00:44:12 Review: The Besnard Lakes
![The Besnard Lakes Are The Roaring Night (Bonus Track Version)](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/2f/77/0a/2f770a6d-67b2-7aee-1756-b179cbf63b96/source/600x600bb.jpg "214980856/445487344")
{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} next turn to the third release from {place: Canadian} {genre: indie rockers} {artist: The Besnard Lakes} called {album: The Besnard Lakes Are the Roaring Night}. Jim describes the album as a mix between nature-inspired "beard" rock and early '{era: 90s} {genre: shoegazer}. This is the duo's most epic effort yet, and Jim recommends it as something you can lose yourself in. Greg wonders if they need a new rating category: "Wow." He'd add orchestral pop and progressive rock to the list of influences. Greg describes the record as an amazing achievement and an example of great collaboration between the husband and wife team. The Besnard Lakes get a double {tag: Buy It}. 

## 00:50:24 DIJ: Greg
{host: Greg} gets to drop a quarter in the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox} this week, and chooses a Joey Ramone-inspired song. {artist: The Ramones} singer was a hero to Greg early on, and his punk spirit helped kick-start Greg's writing career. Joey was always a fan of the classic pop songs he grew up on, and when he got the chance late in life, he worked with one of his own heroes, {artist: Ronnie Spector}. The album was one of Joey's last projects, so to remember him, Greg plays her version of the {artist: Johnny Thunder} song "{track: You Can't Put Your Arms Around a Memory}" as {tag: produced} by {name: Joey Ramone}.
