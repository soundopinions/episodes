# Show 842: Robert Finley, Opinions on Neil Young, The Weeknd & Turnstile, Plus Peter Bogdanovich

For much of his life, Robert Finley's musical talent was a buried treasure, but with "Sharecropper's Son" he made one of the best albums of 2021. Hosts Jim DeRogatis and Greg Kot talk with Finley about his unconventional path to a music career. They also revisit their 2008 conversation with the late director Peter Bogdanovich about his Tom Petty documentary film.
