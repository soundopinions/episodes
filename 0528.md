# Show 528: Glyn Johns & Opinions on Coldplay

![Glyn Johns](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2016/glynjohns_web.jpg)

{place : English} producer and engineer {name : Glyn Johns} has been behind the board for classic albums by {artist : Led Zeppelin}, {artist : the Beatles}, {artist : the Rolling Stones} and {artist : the Clash}. He joins hosts {host : Jim} DeRogatis and {host : Greg} Kot for a candid conversation about being re-worked by {name : Phil Spector}, trying to infuse {artist : The Eagles} with the {genre : blues}, and more from his storied career.



## 00:02:15 Obit: Lemmy

![Lemmy](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/528/3R0.jpg)

With his mutton chops, leather biker gear, and one word moniker, {name : Lemmy} was a larger-than-life rock icon. The lead singer, bassist, and founder of {place : English}  {genre : heavy metal} innovators {artist : Motörhead} died on December 28 at the age of 70. Born Ian Kilmister, Lemmy started out as a roadie for {artist : Jimi Hendrix} before making important contributions to the seminal {genre : space rock} band {artist : Hawkwind}. After getting kicked out of that band in 1975, he formed Motörhead. Initially they didn't fit in with the {genre : metal} and {genre : progressive rock} acts of the time, but became a template for {genre : thrash metal} in the {era : 1980s}. {host : Greg} always appreciated the sly sense of humor behind Lemmy's music. Jim notes that he was also a serious scholar of {tag : military history}. In tribute to Lemmy's passing, he plays the 1979 Motörhead cut "{track : Bomber}" about the {tag : Heinkel He 111} aircraft.



## 00:06:59 Interview: Glyn Johns

![soundman](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/528/BN0.jpg)

One day in February {era : 1969}, {tag : engineer} and {tag : producer}  {name : Glyn Johns} disembarked a flight from {place : Los Angeles} to {place : London}. He went straight to a studio to work with the {tag : Beatles} on what would eventually become {album : Let It Be}. That was followed by an all-night session with the {artist : Rolling Stones} for {album : Let It Bleed}. And after that, he rejoined the Beatles and jutted on over to {place : Royal Albert Hall} to record {artist : Jimi Hendrix} live. Just "a day in the life," eh? Those legendary recordings are just beginning of Johns tremendous list of credits which includes {artist : Led Zeppelin}, the {artist : Faces}, the {artist : Kinks}, {artist : The Who}, the {artist : Eagles} and more recently {artist : Band of Horses} and {artist : Ryan Adams}. He relays this life spent recording in a new book called *Sound Man*. And he is as candid in his conversation with {host : Jim} and {host : Greg}, as he is in print.  The aforementioned {album : Let It Be}? Johns remarks that {name : Phil Spector} "puked" all over it. Of {artist : Eric Clapton}, Johns admits he initially refused to bring him into a session with {artist : Pete Townshend} due to his drug-addled personality. And he talks about parting ways with the Eagles after they wanted to go in a more {genre : rock 'n' roll} direction--something Johns says the band wouldn't know if they fell over it.

For more behind-the-booth conversations, check out Jim and Greg's interviews in the Footnotes section with {name : Stephen Street}, {name : Butch Vig}, {name : Bob Ezrin}, {name : Tony Visconti}, {name : Mark Howard}, {name : Giorgio Moroder}, {name : Joe Boyd} and of course, {name : Brian Eno}.



## 00:48:20 Review: Coldplay

![A Head Full of Dreams](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/528/28K0.jpg)

Over the past 15 years, {artist : Coldplay} has arguably become the biggest {genre : rock} band in music. The group returns with their 7th album, {album : A Head Full of Dreams}, which lead singer {artist : Chris Martin} says is the band's last effort. {host : Greg} thinks that in the past the group has presented some interesting and layered material, but not in {era : 2016}. This is their most {genre : pop}/danceable album yet Greg feels there's a lack of conviction. Coldplay just didn't take it far enough, and the lyrics are pretty awful to boot. Greg gives it a {tag : Trash It}. {host : Jim} agrees and thinks the Coldplay of yore was a very good band indeed. But the Coldplay of today doesn't go anywhere new. Even bringing in the big guns like {artist : Beyoncé} and {tag : President Obama} can't save this record. It's a double {tag : Trash It} for *A Head Full of Dreams*.
