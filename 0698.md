Nearly 50 years after it was initially planned to be released, {artist: Marvin Gaye}'s album {album: You're The Man} is finally available. To understand why it was so delayed, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} turn to producer {name: Ayana Contreras}, an expert on {genre: soul} music. In their review, Jim and Greg agree the album is a gift and a perfect bridge between {album: What's Going On} and {album: Let's Get It On}. Tracks like "{track: The World Is Rated X}" are still relevant in 2019.

## 00:32:21 Rock Doctors: Adam

Music plays a different role in every listener's life. When Sound Opinions listeners are having trouble getting enough "vitamin M," they know they can [turn to the Rock Doctors](https://goo.gl/forms/jEiDbS313xZDPj7e2). Doctors Kot and DeRogatis aren't licensed, but are happy to prescribe musical medicine whatever the patient's need. 

This week our patient is Adam, a guy who has made a lot of changes over the past five years: job change, divorce and an attempt to feel less numb from substance use. Unfortunately, most of his favorite music has deep associations with those very substances. He's looking for new-to-him music that's free of all that baggage. 

Greg recommends the song "{track: Continental Breakfast}" by {artist: Courtney Barnett and Kurt Vile} from their album {album: Lotta Sea Lice}. He says the song reminds him of the importance of friendship and letting your guard down. 

Jim recommends the song "{track: This Year}" by {artist: The Mountain Goats} from their album {album: The Sunset Tree} after seeing it in the final scene of the documentary {tag: Minding The Gap}. He says the chorus, "I'm going to make it through this year if it kills me" is unforgettable. Listen in to find out how the songs worked for Adam.
