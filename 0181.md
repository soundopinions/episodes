## 00:02:19 News: 05.15.09
We're still waiting for the {tag: Justice Department} to weigh in on the merger between {tag: Live Nation} and {tag: Ticketmaster}. But meanwhile, mega corporation Live Nation is still making news. They announced a significant loss of $103.2 million this year, but CEO {name: Michael Rapino} is confident that the company is on track and that concert attendance will be strong this summer. And, as {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} discuss, Live Nation has a plan to make even more revenue: beer. Despite this recession, the company hopes people will buy more beer and hotdogs at increased prices.

While the traditional label system struggles to survive, it looks to the digital realm for salvation. But, as {label: Warner Music} reported this week, not all digital music investments pay off. It had to write off a $33 million loss, mostly due to its web services {tag: Lala}, {tag: Imeem} and {tag: MySpace}. And consumers continue to skirt the system -- for every legal download purchased, 40 are shared illegally. {tag: iTunes} remains the only truly successful digital music service.

## 00:07:53 Interview: Franz Ferdinand
Next up {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} are joined by {name: Alex Kapranos} and {name: Nick McCarthy} from the band {artist: Franz Ferdinand}. Many people will be familiar with the Scots' 2004 hit "{track: Take Me Out}," but they've since gone on to do two more albums. Their most recent, {album: Tonight}, shows the band experimenting more. As Alex explains, they like to keep fans surprised -- whether it's with a lengthy house track, unique sense of style or even a live acoustic performance of the songs "{track: Katherine Kiss Me}," "{track: Darts of Pleasure}," and "{track: Walk Away}." Alex further confounded expectations by taking a turn as a food author with his 2006 road food memoir {tag: Sound Bites: Eating on Tour with Franz Ferdinand.}

## 00:39:18 Review: Green Day
![21st Century Breakdown](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/52/4b/32/524b3264-f59a-c65f-22b4-85a27af631e8/source/600x600bb.jpg "954266/1156538220")
After releasing the blockbuster album *American Idiot* in 2004, {genre: pop punk} band {artist: Green Day} is back with their 8th album {album: 21st Century Breakdown}. This album was over 4 years in the making, and the result is an 18-track rock opera {tag: produced} by {name: Butch Vig}. {tag: Lead singer} {name: Billie Joel Armstrong} is rallying against the establishment as always, but for {host: Jim}, he's not rallying as effectively. He hears a lot of {artist: Queen}-like bombast. Jim thinks half of the album is amazing, but because of the other half, he gives it a {tag: Try It} rating. {host: Greg} explains that this record deserves a number of listens, in sequence, something he says about very few albums these days. He thinks the bombast is actually reigned in pretty tightly, and believes *21st Century Breakdown* is the best work they've done yet. Greg gives the album a {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:48:17 Review: St. Vincent
![Actor (Bonus Track Version)](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/80/66/e5/8066e5d0-2c6a-87a8-2fd4-3fca3fefa281/source/600x600bb.jpg "198271209/310715541")
One of Greg's favorite acts at this year's {tag: SXSW} was {artist: St. Vincent}, also known as {name: Annie Clark}. After performing with the {artist: Polyphonic Spree} and {artist: Sufjan Stevens}, she's released her 2nd solo album {album: Actor}. Greg finds this {tag: sophomore} effort to be a big step up. Clark wrote and produced the material all on her own, and the arrangements blow {host: Greg} away. He thinks it's one of the year's best records so far. {host: Jim} agrees, noting that while Clark may look like a Disney heroine, her songs are full of dark, subversive images. *Actor* gets a double {tag: Buy It}.
