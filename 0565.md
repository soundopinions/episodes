![Herb Alpert](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2016/herbalpert_web.jpg)

Trumpeter {artist: Herb Alpert} has had a remarkable, multifaceted career. In addition to scoring his own hits with the {artist: [Herb Alpert and the ]Tijuana Brass} in the {era: '60s}, he cofounded {label: A&M Records}, signing a diverse roster of artists ranging from {artist: The Carpenters} to {artist: Janet Jackson}.

## 00:01:46 Interview: Herb Alpert
![Whipped Cream & Other Delights](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2016/whipped_web.jpg)
{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} are delighted to be joined this week by legendary {tag: trumpet}er {artist: Herb Alpert}. {artist: Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass} scored a string of instrumental hits in the '60s, from "{track: The Lonely Bull}" to "{track: Casino Royale}" to "{track: A Taste of Honey}." His 1965 album {album: Whipped Cream & Other Delights} became a staple of record collections all over, which was helped by its iconic, risqué cover. He even scored a surprise #1 hit as a vocalist with the {name: Burt Bacharach}/{name: Hal David} composition "{track: This Guy's In Love With You}." But Alpert's remarkable career goes well beyond his own recordings. Along with his partner {name: Jerry Moss}, he cofounded the venerable label {label: A&M Records}, signing a diverse roster including the {artist: Carpenters}, {artist: Cat Stevens}, {artist: Joe Cocker}, [{artist: The Police}](http://soundopinions.org/show/53), and {artist: Janet Jackson}. Through his philanthropic foundation, he's donated millions toward music education. And if that's not enough, he's also an exhibiting sculptor. At age 81, he's still going strong, with a brand new album called {album: Human Nature}. Herb Alpert discusses the genesis of his signature double-trumpet sound, being mentored by {artist: Sam Cooke}, and his ethical approach to owning a label.

## 00:44:09 Review: Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds
![Skeleton Tree](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music60/v4/8c/d0/a6/8cd0a67b-d547-47a7-0241-ef63728b8cbf/source/600x600bb.jpg "1698460/1118138299")

{place: Australia}n {genre: rock} band {artist: Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds} are back with a new record called {album: Skeleton Tree}. The album is particularly dark, even by {name: [Nick] Cave}'s standards, and deals with the aftermath of the death of Cave's teenage son. {host: Jim} thinks it's a hard listen, even for fans. He wishes that the album had a moment of redemption at the end, but recognizes that perhaps Cave has not yet found it. For those reasons, he gives {album: Skeleton Tree} a {tag: Try It}. {host: Greg} agrees that the record is harrowing, meditating on questions of the pointlessness of life and how to carry on after losing a loved one. The way Cave interprets these songs is tragically beautiful, with vocals unlike any he's ever provided, and Greg feels he's working toward the light. While {album: Skeleton Tree} may not be something you want to listen to all the time, he gives it a {tag: Buy It} for its earnest beauty.


## 00:51:50  DIJ: Jim

Recently, {host: Jim} was in a tattoo parlor getting some work done on a sleeve full of his favorite album cover art. As one can imagine, he endured a fair amount of (self-inflicted) discomfort. However, he found refuge in the song "{track: Bad Vibrations}" by {artist: The Black Angels}, which was playing in the shop. Jim's {tag: Desert Island Jukebox} selection comes from the {era: 2010} album {album: Phosphene Dream} by the {genre: psychedelic} {genre: southern rock} band. Even though Jim was getting poked and prodded by a needle for three hours, this song momentarily took him to a groovy place in his mind where he forgot about the pain. The Black Angels conjure up a musical image of a hypnotic, chaotic "bad trip," and Jim digs it big time for the Desert Island.
