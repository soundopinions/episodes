# Show 563: Mudhoney & Opinions on Wilco

![Mudhoney](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2016/mudhoney_web.jpg)

{artist : Mudhoney} was at the forefront of {place : Seattle}'s exploding music scene in the '80s and '90s, paving the way for {genre : grunge} with its distorted, chaotic sound. Though the group never received the world-wide attention of its peers {artist : Nirvana}, Mudhoney has achieved a cult-like longevity. Mudhoney talks with {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} and performs in front of a hometown Seattle audience. Plus, the new album from {place : Chicago} band {artist : Wilco}, and the {genre : psychedelic}sample driving a key {artist : Beyoncé} track.

## 00:01:45 Interview: Mudhoney

For almost 30 years, {genre : rock} band {artist : Mudhoney} has been a staple in the {place : Seattle} music scene. While contemporaries like {artist : Nirvana} and {artist : Soundgarden} earned more commercial success, Mudhoney always stayed true to themselves and {host : Jim} notes they're one of the few bands that "never sucked." The group first garnered attention for the EP {album : Superfuzz Bigmuff} that pioneered the distorted sound big labels would later market as "{genre : grunge}." Jim and {host : Greg} talked with the members of the Mudhoney: vocalist Mark Arm, guitarist Steve Turner, drummer Dan Peters and bassist Guy Maddison, at the {place : Neptune Theatre} in Seattle in front of a live audience. The hosts chatted with Mudhoney about their signature sound, musical collaborations and they also performed several songs from the span of their critically-loved career.



## 00:39:03 Feature: Sample Platter: Beyoncé's "Freedom"

This week we debut a new segment called {tag : Sample Platter}, where {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} highlight a fascinating use of sampling in a pop song. They kick things off with "{track : Freedom}" from {artist : Beyoncé}'s album {album : Lemonade}, one of the most compelling records of the year so far. The centerpiece of the song is an organ sample from "{track : Let Me Try}," an obscure 1969 recording by the {place : Latin America}n {genre : psychedelic} band {artist : Kaleidoscope}. The band formed in {place : Puerto Rico}, signed to a {place : Mexic[o]}an label, and recorded its only album in the {place : Dominican Republic}, which sold only a few hundred copies. Beyoncé resurrected it, transforming its trippy vibe into a stomping, raging march. While Kaleidoscope's hippie-ish song came in the wake of the riots of 1968, Beyoncé brilliantly recontextualizes it as a modern protest anthem in the era of {tag : Black Lives Matter}, featuring a notable guest appearance from {artist : Kendrick Lamar}.



## 00:44:42 Review: Wilco

![Schmilco](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/563/22I0.jpg)

Veteran {place : Chicago} band (and {host : Greg} Kot [biography subject](http://www.wilcobook.com/buy/index.html)) {artist : Wilco} returns with its 10th album, {album : Schmilco}. On this record, leader {name : Jeff Tweedy} explores the alienated feelings of his childhood spent as a misfit in {place : downstate Illinois}. {album : Schmilco} is drawn from the same sessions as the band's previous album, {album : Star Wars}, which Greg says was a jarring but welcome departure for the band. Schmilco  swaps the noise of {album : Star Wars} for an unsettlingly weird folkie vibe à la early {artist : Tyrannosaurus Rex}. No record in their discography sounds like this one, and Greg feels it's deserving of a {tag : Buy It}. {host : Jim} agrees, noting that for a while it was beginning to sound like Wilco had a formula. These last two records have tossed that up, featuring a rawness and realness you wouldn't expect from a band this far into its career.



## 00:51:28 DIJ: Greg

Inspiration for a DIJ pick can come from anywhere. Even a TV commercial. {host : Greg} recently heard a track used for an ad and it jogged his memory of a song he heard on an old mixtape. Sure enough he found the tape, and the song "{track : Born to Wander}" from the singer {artist : Jack Wood}. In the mid-1960s, Jack Wood recorded two songs in small town Michigan. The songs borrowed sounds from soul, garage-rock and Morricone film scores. Greg says the tracks got a few spins on local radio before the music essentially disappeared. Fast forward to 2015 when {name : Jack White} and {label : Third Man Records} re-released the single. Greg says it is a great, one off moment in rock history that is worthy of the Desert Island Jukebox.
