# Show 692: The Stooges' Fun House and Remembering Talk Talk's Mark Hollis

![Stooges](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2019/stooges.jpg)

In a {tag : Classic Album Dissection}, {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} examine {artist : The Stooges}' {album : Fun House} record from 1970. The album brought together {genre : garage rock}, {genre : rhythm and blues} and {genre : free jazz}, setting a template for the {genre : punk} revolution to come. Stooges guitarist {tag : Ron Asheton} talks about the album as well as producer {tag : Don Gallucci}, whose unorthodox studio technique is credited with capturing the singular sound of The Stooges.



## 00:01:52 Classic Album Dissection: The Stooges's Fun House

For our first {tag : Classic Album Dissection} of the year, we're looking at {artist : The Stooges}' second album, {album : Fun House}. It was a big left turn after their debut album in 1969, {album : The Stooges}, which was produced by {name : John Cale} fresh off {artist : The Velvet Underground}. Where their debut featured production flourishes like hand claps and sleigh bells, {album : Fun House} was recorded almost entirely live to tape- including {artist : Iggy Pop}'s energetic vocals. The album wound up being recorded live because the producer, {label : Elektra} staff producer {name : Don Gallucci} (who also happens to have played keyboard on {artist : The Kingsmen}'s "{track : Louie Louie},") removed all the sound proofing from the studio in an attempt to replicate the band's live set-up â€” including giving Iggy a hand-held microphone. With no baffles, there was so much "bleed" that multitracking was impossible. The irony was that the {label : Elektra} studios were state of the art to achieve quiet and "clean" recordings for the {genre : folk} artists who made up the majority of the {label : Elektra} lineup at the time.

It's easy to draw parallels between the {album : Fun House} sessions and Gallucci's experience recording "{track : Louie Louie}" seven years prior. Gallucci told {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} that {artist : The Kingsmen} weren't happy with {name : Jack Ely}'s vocals on their first take, but the engineer refused to turn down his vocal microphone (and he lacked the self control to stand further away). The band's creative solution was to suspend the mic above Ely, so he couldn't reach it and his vocals would be buried in the mix. The unintended side effect was a room sound, creating the "goofy party" effect as Gallucci described it.

{host : Jim} and {host : Greg} both profess to be big fans of The Stooges, though they differ when it comes to {album : Fun House}. {host : Greg} declares it one of the greatest {genre : rock} records ever recorded, while {host : Jim} says he loves the song-oriented first half, but can't stand the {genre : free jazz}-influenced second half. {host : Jim} cites "{track : Down On The Street}" and "{track : Dirt}" ([and a {name : Lester Bangs} essay on {album : Fun House}](https://web.archive.org/web/20071217234128/http://www.creemmagazine.com/_site/BeatGoesOn/IggyPop/OfPopAndPiesPt001.html)) as crucial to the development of the {genre : punk} aesthetic. {host : Greg} calls the experimental second half of the record an evocative synthesis of {genre : rock}, {genre : funk} and {genre : free jazz}. He insists that the chemistry between {name : Iggy}, guitarist {name : Ron} and drummer {name : Scott Asheton}, bassist {name : Dave Alexander} and saxophonist {name : Steve Mackay} was so singular, that is may never be replicated.



## 00:51:47 DIJ: Greg

{host : Greg} puts another quarter in the {tag : Desert Island Jukebox}, this time paying tribute to {artist : Mark Hollis} of the {tag : British} rock band {artist : Talk Talk}, who died last month at the age of 64. During his career, Mark evolved from a punk rocker into a composer of complex {genre : post-rock} on albums such as {album : Laughing Stock} and {album : Spirit of Eden}, inspiring later bands like {artist : Radiohead}. In between, Talk Talk scored a few {genre : synth-pop} hits, like 1984's "{track : It's My Life}." Greg's selection, the aptly-titled "{track : Life's What You Make It}," is from an album that he think was a breakthrough in Hollis' career: 1986's {album : The Colour Of Spring}.
