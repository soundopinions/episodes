# Show 443: Songs from the Front Lines

![Songs from the Front Lines](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2014/frontlines_web.jpg)

Songs from the Front Lines: Jim and Greg celebrate **{tag: Memorial Day}** with music capturing the veteran experience. Later they review {artist: Coldplay}'s {album: Ghost Stories}. 

## 00:03:04 Review: Michael Jackson
![XSCAPE](//static.soundopinions.org/assets/443/540.jpg "32940/850693793")
Is {artist: Michael Jackson} back from the dead? It seems like it lately, with the {album: Thriller} star [moonwalking from beyond the grave](http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/18/5729866/michael-jackson-hologram-at-billboard-music-awards), and his second {tag: posthumous} release debuting at #2 this week. {album: Xscape} features eight hitherto-unreleased tracks, each in two forms: Jackson's original demos, plus new versions spiffed up by {tag: producer}s like {name: L.A. Reid}, {name: StarGate} and {name: Timbaland}. {host: Greg} finds it interesting that they included the demos -- as he puts it, there was a reason {name: [Michael] Jackson} left those behind. And while the production team did a good job reworking the tracks, Greg doubts that the Prince of {genre: Pop} would have been satisfied with this album. {host: Jim} ponders the bizarre tracklist, which includes an update of {artist: America}'s "{track: A Horse with No Name}," a {artist: Paul Anka} collaboration, and a song titled "{track: Do You Know Where Your Children Are}" that Jim finds simply "disturbing." While {album: Xscape} isn't as awful as other posthumous releases ({artist: Tupac} and {artist: Jimi Hendrix} come to mind), neither host thinks fans will keep listening once the hype dies down. It's a double {tag: Trash It}.

## 00:06:54 News: 05.23.14 
Oh, how the mighty have fallen—and we're not just talking about lackluster MJ. After its two-month reign as the nation's #1 album, the {album: Frozen} soundtrack has at last been ousted from its throne... by {album: Now That's What I Call Music! Vol. 50}. What are we to make of this coup by {label: Universal}'s unending compilation series? On one hand, it's proof that the {genre: Top 40} crowd is still the biggest force in purchasing music. But on the other, it's surprising that teens still want *Now!* to curate their playlists when it's so easy to create their own. {track: Turn Down for What}? For {name: Idina Menzel}, apparently.

## 00:50:17 Review: Coldplay
![Ghost Stories](//static.soundopinions.org/assets/443/2BT0.jpg)
In 2011, not even Jim and Greg's [disapproval](show/310/review/coldplay) could keep {artist: Coldplay}'s {album: Mylo Xyloto} from taking the band to new heights of arena {genre: rock} success. Three years later, {name: Chris Martin} and his plaintive falsetto are back for more with {album: Ghost Stories}, the band's sixth studio album. Initially, {host: Greg} appreciated *Ghost Stories*'s move away from the anthemic sing-alongs of *Mylo Xyloto* into a more sparse musical landscape, not unlike the band's melodic debut {album: Parachutes}. Ultimately, though, *Ghost Stories* never quite reaches the same heights as that album, with both critics put to sleep by Martin's ([newfound](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/chris-martin-on-gwyneth-paltrow-uncoupling-if-you-cant-open-yourself-up-you-cant-appreciate-the-wonder-inside-9295002.html)) heartbreak-filled lyrics set to somber music that's molded in part by {genre: EDM} producer {artist: Avicii} and {genre: hip hop} {artist: Timbaland}. {host: Jim} and Greg both say {tag: Trash It}.
