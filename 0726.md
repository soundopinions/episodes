![Battles Juice B Crypts](https://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2019/battles.jpg)

Twelve years after their debut album, {artist: Battles} is back with their fourth full length record, {album: Juice B Crypts}. The {genre: experimental art punk} project boasts a strong lineage connecting it to {artist: Helmet}, {artist: Don Caballero} and {artist: Tomahawk}. That lineage is boosted on this album by guest appearances from {name: Jon Anderson} of {artist: Yes}, {artist: Tune-Yards}, {artist: Shabbaz Palaces} and more. {host: Greg} says in some ways this album reminds him of {genre: cartoon soundtracks} and {host: Jim} agrees, citing {name: Carl Stallings} and {name: Milt Franklyn}'s work on {tag: Looney Tunes} as an apt comparison for the album's frenetic pace. They're both very enthusiastic about the latest from Battles.

##  00:46:30 DIJ: Greg

{name: Nick Tosches} began his writing career as an iconoclastic music critic.

Jim also admired Tosches' work on non-music topics including noir novels and explorations of {name: Dante}. Greg pays tribute to their recently deceased friend by playing a deep cut from {artist: Jerry Lee Lewis}, who Tosches immortalized in his book, {tag: Hellfire}.
