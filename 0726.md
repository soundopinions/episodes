Twelve years after their debut album, {artist : Battles} is back with their fourth full length record, {album : Juice B Crypts}. The {genre : experimental art punk} project boasts a strong lineage connecting it to {artist : Helmet}, {artist : Don Caballero} and {artist : Tomahawk}. That lineage is boosted on this album by guest appearances from {name : Jon Anderson} of {artist : Yes}, {artist : Tune-Yards}, {artist : Shabbaz Palaces} and more. {host : Greg} says in some ways this album reminds him of {genre : cartoon soundtracks} and {host : Jim} agrees, citing {name : Carl Stallings} and {name : Milt Franklyn}'s work on {tag : Looney Tunes} as an apt comparison for the album's frenetic pace. They're both very enthusiastic about the latest from Battles.
