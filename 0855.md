Author {tag : Bob Spitz} has written biographies of figures as diverse as Ronald Reagan, Julia Child and The Beatles. Now he has turned his attention to the next best-selling act: {artist : Led Zeppelin}. As Bruce Springsteen's manager during Led Zeppelin's heyday, he didn't follow their career closely so he came to the topic with fresh eyes. He documents many abuses of power by the band and their inner circle along with their musical accomplishments.
