## 00:04:13 Intro: Music News
Everyone loves a steal, even corporations. {tag: Specific Media} recently got quite a deal in procuring {tag: MySpace}. {tag: News Corp}. purchased the website in 2005 for $580 million; now they've unloaded it for $35 million. It's proof that MySpace doesn't have the cultural cache it once did. But {artist: Justin Timberlake} is doing his best to fix that. The {genre: pop} {tag: singer} and {tag: actor} (who incidentally portrayed Facebook's Sean Parker) will work with the new owners to "rebuild and reinvigorate" the site. But websites are like reality stars – it's rare to get more than fifteen minutes of fame.

Speaking of cheap deals, pop music is anything but. {tag: Planet Money} recently tallied the costs that went into making {artist: Rihanna}'s "{track: Man Down}" a hit. Between the big name songwriters, producers and expensive promotion, the dollar amount comes to $1,078,000. As Greg explains, this is nothing new. Record companies were spending this kind of dough twenty years ago. But at that time the returns were much greater. To spend a million on a song that might make two to three million? The math doesn't add up.

## 00:08:25 Special: Wax Trax!
People in {place: Chicago} of a certain age fondly remember strolling down {place: Lincoln Avenue} into {label: Wax Trax! Records}. It was the epicenter of cutting edge culture in the {era: 1980s}. But even if you weren't there to sample goods from the record store and label, you're familiar with its influence. Owners {name: Jim Nash} and {name: Dannie Flesher} created a world headquarters for artists who bridged {genre: disco}, {genre: house}, {genre: electronic}, {genre: punk}, and {genre: industrial} music. Acts like {artist: Ministry}, {artist: Front 242}, {artist: RevCo}, {artist: Underworld}, {artist: KMFDM}, and {artist: My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult} went on to sell millions of records internationally. Nash died in 1995 and Flesher in 2010. A year later, Wax Trax friends and family celebrated its 33 1/3 anniversary at {tag: Metro} in Chicago. Two key players in that scene were {artist: Chris Connelly} and {artist: Paul Barker}. They share their memories of Wax Trax with Jim and Greg.

## 00:45:15 Review: Beyoncé
![4](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/293/23F0.jpg)
{artist: Beyoncé}'s got her fourth album and her fourth number one...aptly named {album: 4}. With this record, she's earned her stripes, so rumors swirled that she was indulging her whims production-wise by collaborating with {artist: Diplo} and {artist: Fela Kuti} and recording upwards of seventy songs. But,rumors were just that, and of those seventy tracks, Beyoncé picked some doozies. {host: Greg} hears more {genre: soul} on the ballads, but otherwise is disappointed by the hodge podge of bad choices. {host: Jim} can't even get behind the ballads and calls *4* the epitomy of factory-made {genre: pop} product. *4* = 2 {tag: Trash It}s.

## 00:50:49 DIJ: Greg
Jim and {host: Greg} sail away to the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}, and it's Greg's turn to choose a song. He wants to return to the high point of the {artist: New York Dolls}. They're still making music today, but it's nothing Jim and Greg want to remember. Greg goes back to 1973's "{track: Personality Crisis}," which showcases what was so amazing about the Dolls: {name: Johnny Thunder}'s {tag: guitar}, {name: Syl Sylvain}'s pop smarts, and {name: David Johansen}'s charisma. People called the group "{genre: glam}," but Greg credits them as the 1st {name: punk} band, giving way to the {artist: Sex Pistols}.
