# Show 90: The Rock Doctors Prescribe Hip-Hop & Opinions on The New Pornographers and M.I.A.
Drs. Kot and DeRogatis, MD are back for another {tag: Rock Doctors} consultation. Tune in to hear their prescriptions for better musical health. Then, stay tuned for reviews of new albums from melodic indie-rockers {artist: The New Pornographers} and avant-pop artist {artist: M.I.A}.

## 00:01:50 News: 08.18.07
First in the news {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} discuss the controversy over the {tag: censorship} of political lyrics in a song by {artist: Pearl Jam} during the {tag: AT&T Blue Room} webcast of their recent Lollapalooza performance. While Pearl Jam criticized this kind of censorship on their website and posted both versions of the song, it appeared that the audio editing was a fluke. In the days following the festival, though, it was revealed that this was not the first time such censorship had occurred, sparking interest from advocates of Internet neutrality. Both Jim and Greg agree that webcasters have a public responsibility to broadcast what actually happens at events, and concert promoters have a responsibility to tell bands whether or not they're giving up their right to free speech. Both critics are anxious to see how things play out in the weeks leading up to the next big festival, {tag: Austin City Limits}.

Another news story confirms our suspicion that music fans have better brains. Or at least more active brains. Researchers at {tag: Stanford} Medical School recently released findings that show that music increases brain receptivity and reception. To find out about the study Jim and Greg speak with the paper's senior author, Dr. {name: Vinod Menon}, associate professor of {tag: psychiatry} and behavioral sciences and of neurosciences at Stanford. Dr. Menon explains that the greatest amount of activity occurred during moments of transition or pauses. While he used the tunes of 18th-century English composer {artist: William Boyce}, it's interesting to think about how this research applies to {genre: rock} music. Check out the MRI for yourself [here](http://med.stanford.edu/news_releases/2007/july/music.html).

In another miracle of science, (most of) the original members of {era: '80s} rock group {artist: Van Halen} announced they are reuniting this fall for a series of concerts. The band's first lead singer, {name: David Lee Roth}, will perform with the band for the first time in 22 years. Fans expected this announcement a few months ago, only to be left disappointed by guitarist {name: Eddie Van Halen}'s trip to rehab. But now the {name: Sammy Hagar} and {name: Gary Cherone}-haters will get their wish... sort of. Founding bassist {name: Michael Anthony} has been given the boot, and Eddie's son {name: Wolfgang van Halen} will replace him. Not only were the names Anthony and Hagar omitted from the group's press release, but Anthony's image had been airbrushed from a picture of the band's album cover on the website. As quick as history was revised, it was re-revised, though, and Anthony is back in the picture. Only literally of course.

Record label owner, broadcaster, journalist, pop impresario and nightclub founder {name: Anthony Wilson} died last week at the age of 57. Wilson is the man who put the {place: Manchester} music scene on the map, a scene that included {artist: Joy Division}, {artist: New Order} and {artist: The Happy Mondays}. He ran {label: Factory Records} in the {era: late 1970s} and the {tag: Hacienda} nightclub in the {era: 1980s} and {era: early 1990s}. Many listeners will remember {name: Steve Coogan}'s portrayal of Wilson in the semi-fictional story of the Hacienda, {tag: 24 Hour Party People}. But, Jim and Greg choose to remember Wilson through the music he influenced. 

### List: Anthony Wilson's Factory Records

- {artist: Joy Division}, "{track: Love Will Tear Us Apart}" 
- {artist: Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark}, "{track: Electricity}" 
- {artist: New Order}, "{track: Ceremony}" 
- {artist: Electronic}, "{track: Getting Away With It}" 
- {artist: The Happy Mondays}, "{track: Step On}" 


## 00:21:45 Rock Doctors: Pat
In the HMO-free universe of the {tag: Rock Doctors}, everyone is entitled to better musical health. This week's patient is Pat from Chicago, IL. Pat wrote to Sound Opinions H.Q. for advice on how to get better acquainted with {genre: hip hop}, and we immediately set her up for an appointment with Drs. Kot and DeRogatis. Pat explains that she's generally fairly hip to music, preferring doses of {artist: Bob Dylan}, {artist: Wilco} and {artist: Galaxie 500}. But when it comes to hip hop, she's clueless, and in an effort to expand her musical horizons and have some music in common with her {genre: rap}-loving nephews, she asks for some guidance.

Greg gives the first prescription. He's not sure if his approach will be too radical, but judging from Pat's tastes, he decides to go out on a limb. He recommends the patient listen to {artist: Outkast}'s fourth album {album: Stankonia}. Greg admits to Pat that some moments might be slightly too "{genre: gangsta}" or misogynistic for her, but he hopes that the first-rate songwriting and bold beats of tracks like "{track: Ms. Jackson}" will win her over.

Jim's prescription is {album: 3 Feet High and Rising}, the {genre: classic hip hop} album by {artist: De La Soul}. Jim thinks Pat will respond well to the creative stories being told by the three geeky hippies from {place: Long Island}. He also thinks she will appreciate some of the more recognizable samples, like {artist: Hall and Oates}' song "{track: I Can't Go For That (No Can Do)}."

A week later Pat finishes her treatment and reports back to the doctors. She starts off by breaking the bad news to Greg: {album: Stankonia} is not for her. She felt there were too many misogynistic moments like the song, "{track: We Luv Deez Hoez}," and wouldn't feel comfortable sharing this album with her nephews. But, on the brighter side, she really enjoyed the De La Soul album. It's definitely something she could see herself listening to in the future, and she particularly liked the song, "{track: Eye Know}," which samples both {artist: Steely Dan} and {artist: Otis Redding}. So, while the treatment wasn't a total success, Pat is on the road to better musical health. And, more importantly, she now has more hip bragging rights with her friends.

## 00:38:59 Review: The New Pornographers
![Challengers](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/40/8e/75/408e754c-09c6-6de2-a8ba-bed84ca1a6e9/source/600x600bb.jpg "4978498/260217631")
The first album up for review this week is by the Canadian {genre: indie-pop} supergroup {artist: The New Pornographers}. Band leader {name: A.C. Newman}, along with {artist: Destroyer}'s {name: Dan Bejar}, {name: Neko Case} and a cast of other songwriters and musicians have recorded their fourth album together, {album: Challengers}. The album is another collection of melodic, hook-filled songs, but Greg admits that Bejar almost steals the record with his track, "{track: Myriad Harbor}," a {genre: power-pop} meets {genre: hip-hop} composition. He loves the tongue-in-cheek, carefree attitude of many of the songs, but doesn't think the album is as good as its predecessor, {album: Twin Cinema}. Because the energy level is uncharacteristically down for the band, {host: Greg} gives this New Pornographers effort a {tag: Try It}. {host: Jim} was glad to hear the band went for something different. They did three albums of pure, effervescent {genre: pop}, and now they've added orchestrations to the mix. He gives {album: Challengers} a {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:46:03 Review: M.I.A.
![Kala (Bonus Track Version)](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/cf/31/34/cf313421-e769-b201-472f-fc8850f9293d/source/600x600bb.jpg "14677454/262161787")
The {place:  Sri Lanka}n-British rapper {artist: M.I.A.} also has a new album out this week called {album: Kala}. After making a splash with her {era: 2005} album {album: Arular}, {name: Mya Arulpragasam} impressed fans with her unique vocal style and memorable beats, but she also disappointed many with her live performances. Now she's back with another revolutionary sounding record -- a collection of rhythms and sounds from all over the world. {host: Jim} was not as wowed by M.I.A. with her debut, and she doesn't quite win him over with this follow-up. He is impressed by {name: Switch}'s production, but thinks that there are a number of bum tracks, especially the collaboration with {name: Timbaland}, and gives it a {tag: Try It} overall. {host: Greg} agrees that the Timbaland track is a miss, but he thinks {album: Kala} is an extraordinary record. He describes it as a mind-blowing collage, something completely fresh and new. But, he also thinks that the hooks give {album: Kala} a long shelf life. {host: Greg} gives the second M.I.A. album a {tag: Buy It}.
