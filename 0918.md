# Show 918: War's "The World Is a Ghetto" Plus Opinions on Janelle Monáe & Jenny Lewis



## 00:00:00 Intro: Coming Soon

This week, Jim DeRogatis and Greg Kot do a classic album dissection of the best-selling album of 1973, War's “The World Is a Ghetto.” They talk with effusive frontman Lonnie Jordan about the writing and recording of the record, and about wild stories back in the day. Plus, the hosts review new music from Janelle Monáe and Jenny Lewis.
