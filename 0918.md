## 00:00:48 Review: Janelle Monáe

The actor and musician {artist : Janelle Monáe} has focused on an Afrofuturist sci-fi worldview on most of their previous albums. But on their new effort, {album : The Age of Pleasure}, the sci-fi is gone and Monáe is freely depicting a vision of black queer pleasure. 

## 00:07:14 Review: Jenny Lewis

{artist : Jenny Lewis} also has done her share of acting, and her latest album, {album : Joy’All}, is also lighter and breezier than her previous work. Working with Nashville producer Dave Cobb, Lewis is more “countrypolitan” than ever on this album.
