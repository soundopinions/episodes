# Show 527: Mixtapes 2015 and the Return of the Cassette 

![Mixtapes 2015](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2016/2015mixtapes_web.jpg)

{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} share their favorite songs of the year through their {era: 2015} {tag: Mixtapes}. Plus, they talk about one of the year's most surprising musical trends: the {tag: cassette} comeback.

## 00:01:45 Feature: The Return of the Cassette
On this {tag: mixtape}-centric episode of Sound Opinions, {tag: Jim} and {tag: Greg} confess they haven't recently listened to an actual {tag: cassette tape}. And in this age of instantly downloadable music, the real question is: has anyone? 

As it turns out, yes.  Much like {tag: vinyl}, {tag: cassette} tapes are peeking out from obsolescence to make a significant reappearance.

{tag: The National Audio Company} – the biggest of the few audio cassette producers that still exist – reported upward of 10 million cassettes sold in 2014 and a 20% increase in profit. In recent years, big-name bands like Dinosaur Jr. and MGMT have put out cassette tapes to a widely positive response. In fact, the best-selling release of {tag: Record Store Day} this year was not a {tag: vinyl} record at all but a cassette--{artist: Metallica}'s {album: No Life Til Leather}, selling close to 3,000 copies. Despite the convenience of mp3 files, cassette-tape listeners value the sound and sentiment of this old-fashioned music medium. Jim and Greg talk to {name: Steve Stepp}, the owner of the National Audio Company, about this surprising comeback.
