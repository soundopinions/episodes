# Show 701: Band Reunions, Opinions on Vampire Weekend
![replacements](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2019/replacements.jpg)

Summer is comingâ€¦and that means a slew of music festivals and arena concerts around the country. Many bands hit the road for {tag: reunion} tours, often times without all their original members. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} explore whether or not it's sacrilegious to see a band missing its key original members. They'll also share some of their favorite {tag: band reunions}, ones that lived up to or even surpassed the originals. Plus, a review of the latest from {artist: Vampire Weekend}.

## 00:02:07 Review: Vampire Weekend
![vampire](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/701/3J0.png)
{artist: Vampire Weekend} is back with its fourth album, {album: Father of the Bride}, after a six year hiatus. The group of then-Columbia University students put out their debut, eponymous album in 2008 to a lot of critical and commercial attention. That debut leaned on {tag: South African rhythms} drawing comparisons to {name: Paul Simon}'s {album: Graceland}. This new album doesn't stray too far from that original sound. {host: Jim} has never been a fan, even though he admits that listening to the band's rhythm section at music festivals is fun. He says he doesn't care for the band's pretentious lyrics and vocal inflections, feeling like they lean too much into cultural appropriation. {host: Greg} argues the album is catchy and pleasant and features lots of guests, including {artist: HAIM} and {artist: Jenny Lewis}. Ultimately, Greg isn't bothered by the record, but it doesn't inspire him either.

## 00:10:43 List: Reunions
![reunions](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/701/HV0.jpg)

Summer is coming, and along with the sunshine and warm temperatures comes a miriad of music festivals and big arena tours. This summer we've got {artist: Mott the Hoople}, {artist: Heart}, {artist: Wu-Tang Clan} and {artist: Hootie and the Blowfish} reuniting. And then there are the 'reunited' bands who are always playing like {artist: Styx} and {artist: Foreigner}. However, many original members of bands like these have either died, become estranged or are afflicted with health issues that prevent them from performing. Sometimes there might only be one original member in the group, and it's not even the lead singer or guitarist. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} wonder: is it sacrilegious to attend a "{tag: reunion} concert" if it's not really one? 

They talk with music journalist {tag: Rob Tannenbaum} about [his article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/arts/music/band-name-reunions.html) in the {tag: New York Times} on band reunions. (Artwork by Mark Pernice for the *New York Times*)

Jim and Greg also each pick two of their favorite reunions and one that they hope for.

### Jim:
- {artist: Patti Smith Group}
- {artist: Neil Young and Crazy Horse}
- Wishlist: {artist: ABBA}

### Greg:
- {artist: A Tribe Called Quest}
- {artist: Mission of Burma}
- Wishlist: {artist: Talking Heads}
