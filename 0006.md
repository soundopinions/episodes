# Show 6: Julian Casablancas & Mary J. Blige Review

## 00:02:26 News: 1-7-2006
{host: Greg} begins this week's news segment by complimenting {host: Jim}'s use of the word "Blitzkrieg" in reference to {artist: The Strokes}' quick tour of {place: North America}. Our first news story deals with the top 20 grossing concerts of {era: 2005}. The saggy-butted {artist: Rolling Stones} led the list with a gross total of $162 million, followed by {host: Jim}'s favorite band, {artist: U2}. Two "artists", {artist: Celine Dion} and {artist: Barry Manilow}, didn't even have to tour to make the list—they simply took residency in one of {place: Las Vegas}'s gaudy venues and raked in the cash. 

A favorite of Sound Opinions, {name: Courtney Love}, returned to the headlines recently in a {tag: New York Post} story detailing her financial woes, and more importantly, contemplating the sale of the {artist: Nirvana} catalogue. Jim believes this would be a disaster, akin to {artist: Michael Jackson} [bringing](http://www.guardian.co.uk/thebeatles/story/0,11212,606544,00.html) the {artist: Beatles} to {tag: Nike}.

A sad story rounds out our news segment: the death of legendary {place: Chicago} singer {artist: Lou Rawls}. The velvety-voiced singer died of cancer in {place: Los Angeles}. Growing up on the south side of Chicago, he referred to the the cold Chicago wind as the "Hawk," and introduced the monologue to music, leading the way for {genre: hip-hop} as an art-form. He was neighbors with another Chicago legend, {artist: Sam Cooke}, and traded lines with him in the soul classic "{track: Bring it on Home}". Lou's final public appearance was a stirring rendition of {track: God Bless America} during the {tag: World Series}. 

## 00:21:51 Interview: Julian Casablancas
A solo {host: Jim} sat down with {name: Julian Casablancas}, lead singer of {artist: The Strokes}, just hours before the band kicked off its American tour at the Park West in {place: Chicago}. {artist: The Strokes}' third album {album: First Impressions of Earth} had been released that same day—a fact that seemed to concern the lead singer. {album: First Impressions} is a departure for the band in that it's their first album not produced by {name: Gordon Raphael}. Rather, the band looked to {name: David Kahne}, a higher-profile producer who took a less minimalist approach and stretched the band's sound with the introduction of unusual instruments like the {tag: mellotron}. The production also lets more of Julian's voice shine, which you can hear in tracks Julian chose to play: "{track: Juicebox}," "{track: Ask Me Anything}," and "{track: Vision of Division}."  Check out the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoltwBHXCx8&feature=kp) for "{track: Juicebox}," featuring one of the stars of {tag: Arrested Development}, and one-half of {tag: Mr. Show}.

## 00:39:08 Review: The Strokes
![First Impressions of Earth](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/bd/52/59/bd5259d8-e017-0a13-a9b9-c528a3fc19c3/source/600x600bb.jpg "560289/299740383")
Following the interview, our hosts review {album: First Impressions of Earth}. Both {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} agree that Kahne succeeded in stretching {artist: The Strokes} out. However, Greg thinks there is a lot of filler on the album. For him, it's an experiment that did not work, making {album: First Impressions} only a {tag: Burn It}. Jim, on the other hand, believes it's good (though not great) from beginning to end. He thinks it might even be better than the previous release, {album: Room on Fire}, and recommends it as a {tag: Buy It}, even for {artist: Barry Manilow} fans.

## 00:44:52 Review: Mary J. Blige
![The Breakthrough (Bonus Tracks)](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music3/v4/3e/bd/37/3ebd37d4-3277-a11e-5a5c-06f06829ca76/source/600x600bb.jpg "1392280/962592371")
{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} next review the latest release from reigning {genre: R&B} queen {artist: Mary J. Blige}. Blige is an artist who has been put through the ringer, but things were a lot more stable during the making of {album: The Breakthrough}. This didn't affect Blige's sound, however, which is as gritty as ever. While Jim and Greg prefer the singer live, they agree that this is Blige's best album since {era: 1992}'s {album: What's the 411}. (Sound Opinions H.Q. also recommends her 1999 release {album: Mary}). Our hosts are especially impressed with how Blige manages not to be overshined by the presence of so many star producers like {name: Dr. Dre}, {name: Jimmy Jam}, {name: Terry Lewis} and {name: Will.i.am,} nor star guests like {artist: Jay-Z}, {artist: Raphael Saadiq} and {artist: Nina Simone} (from the beyond). Fellow divas {artist: Beyoncé Knowles} and {artist: Alicia Keys} can't always say that.

## 00:53:17 DIJ: Jim
{host: Jim} puts the quarter in the **{tag: Desert Island Jukebox}** this week. His pick is the {artist: Rolling Stones}' track "{track: 2000 Man}" off their {era: 1967} album {album: Their Satanic Majesties Request}. Jim chose this song after watching {name: Wes Anderson}'s {tag: Bottle Rocket}, which features it during the climax of the movie. Yet many people overlook this album, which was made during a hectic time for the Stones. The band was being criticized for trying to imitate their chief competitor. In addition, both {name: Brian Jones} and {name: Keith Richards} were busted for drug possession during the making of the album, which {name: Ian Stewart} refers to as "That damn Satanic Majesties." The Stones fallibility here is what Jim likes though. For him, the album holds up better than later, better-received records, and "2000 Man" is something he'd love to see live.
