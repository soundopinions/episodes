## 00:43:35 Review: Damon Albarn
![Everyday Robots (Special Edition)](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music6/v4/70/3e/cd/703ecd8d-4e23-1e67-383d-ee2d6686ff01/source/600x600bb.jpg "42105591/797058027")
Since founding the {genre: Britpop} group {artist: Blur}, frontman {artist: Damon Albarn} has bounced from project to project – writing and singing for {artist: Gorillaz}, collaborating with African artists on {album: Mali Music}, and even composing an opera called {album: Dr Dee}. But only now, at age 46, has {name: [Damon] Albarn} finally released a solo album. {album: Everyday Robots} is a deeply personal debut, with Albarn boldly exploring his dark past, existential crises and struggles with heroin. But the constant brooding is too much for {host: Greg}. He insists that Albarn's work with Gorillaz was just as personal, yet more upbeat, and with hooks you could dig into. *Robots*, on the other hand, is a {tag: Trash It}. {host: Jim} couldn't disagree more. He considers the album a masterpiece, with Albarn baring his soul over "heartbeat percussion" and stripped-down instrumentals, and would absolutely {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:49:20 Review: Kelis
![Food](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b8/Kelis_-_Food.png/220px-Kelis_-_Food.png "772086/852441649")
Singer (and {tag: Cooking Channel} personality) {name: Kelis Rogers} has just released her sixth album, called, appropriately, {album: Food}. {artist: Kelis} was huge in the {place: UK} in the early {era: 2000s}, but her {era: 2003} hit "{track: Milkshake}" was the first (and last) time that American audiences paid her much attention. On {album: Food}, Kelis is again blending the creative and the culinary -- not only does the album have songs titled "{track: Breakfast}" and "{track: Jerk Ribs}," but she also uses cooking to signify themes of love and family, notes {host: Jim}. He's thrilled to see Kelis creating energetic {genre: neo-soul} again. {host: Greg} hears "layers of flavors" on the album, and appreciates that producer {name: Dave Sitek} took care to showcase her voice, which comes out as sultry, ragged, and honest. {album: Food} is some of the best music Kelis has made, and our hosts gobble it up. It's a double {tag: Buy It}.
