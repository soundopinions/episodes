## 00:02:12 News: 11.16.2012
{tag: Cassette tapes} aren't just for boutique indie labels anymore. At least that's what {tag: IBM} is betting. The company has developed a tiny cassette tape that can store up to 35 terabytes of data, and it's touting it as the "new" green technology. Unlike server farms, researchers point out, tape at rest consumes zero energy. Need more proof the cassette's not dead? Greg suggests taking a gander at the rare {artist: Radiohead} cassettes [currently up](http://www.ebay.com/sch/sis.html?_nkw=Radiohead%20first%20four%20demo%20cassette%20tapes%20On%20A%20Friday%20Shindig%20Manic%20Hedgehog&_itemId=160912578428) on {tag: eBay}.

Well, it's official: '{era: 90s} nostalgia has arrived. {tag: CBS} just announced the development of new sitcom, {tag: Smells Like Teen Spirit}. The show follows a young entrepreneur as he tries to launch an internet startup with help from his "1990's indie rock parents." Which got us thinking - what other alt-era hits could be re-purposed as {tag: TV pilots}? Coming to a station near you, the hilarious rom com *[Black Hole Sun](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mbBbFH9fAg)*? Or the detective show *[Losing My Religion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=if-UzXIQ5vw)*?

## 00:06:59 List: Turkey Shoot
{tag: Thanksgiving} is just around the corner, which means it's time for Sound Opinions' annual {tag: Turkey Shoot}. These aren't just bad records, they're bad records from artists that are capable of better. Nothing stings like disappointment, and these were the biggest musical disappointments of {tag: 2012}:

### Greg
- {artist: WZRD}, {album: WZRD}
- {artist: Dead Can Dance}, {album: Anastasis}
- {artist: Gary Clark, Jr.}, {album: Blak and Blu}

### Jim
- {artist: Damon Albarn}, {album: Dr Dee}
- {artist: Fiona Apple}, {album: The Idler Wheel Is Wiser Than the Driver of the Screw and Whipping Cords Will Serve You More Than Ropes Will Ever Do}
- {artist: Green Day}, {album: Â¡Uno!}

### Listeners
Everyone's a critic, so Jim and Greg turn the rifle over to the listeners:

- Yann in Paris, France: {artist: The Shins}, {album: Port of Morrow}
- Brandon in Cuba, New York: {artist: Smashing Pumpkins}, {album: Oceania}
- Jon in Madison, Wisconsin: {artist: Kiss}, {album: Monster}

## 00:42:46 Review: The Coup
![Sorry to Bother You](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/364/1ZA0.jpg)

Jim and Greg have their fingers crossed that {album: Sorry to Bother You}, the sixth album from {place: Oakland}-based {genre: hip-hop} group {artist: The Coup}, isn't a turkey. This band has been making consistently good agit-rap records since 1991, Greg says, but they remain best known for an unfortunate incident involving their cover art. Does the band deliver on Sorry to Bother You? {host: Jim} says yes. He wouldn't blame you for mistaking "{track: The Magic Clap}" for a new {artist: OutKast} party anthem. The Coup has verged dangerously close to {artist: Rage Against the Machine} self-righteousness in the past, he says, but on *Sorry to Bother You*, the band's got the "party to politics" ratio just right. {host: Greg} agrees and calls it the best Coup album yet. *Sorry to Bother You* gets a double {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:49:12 DIJ: Greg
Soul singer {artist: Cody Chesnutt} has a new album out, reminding {host: Greg} that he's often left off the list of masterful {tag: vocalist}s. This is most evident on his 2002 album {album: The Headphone Masterpiece}. In fact, {artist: The Roots} were such fans they re-worked his song "{track: The Seed}" into "{track: The Seed (2.0)}." and released it as part of their album {album: Phrenology}. Greg takes it with him to the desert island this week.
