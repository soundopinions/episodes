## 00:04:04 Interview: Allen Toussaint
{artist: Allen Toussaint}, musical legend out of {place: New Orleans}, died on November 10 at the age of 77. In honor of his passing, Jim and Greg revisit their 2013 conversation with the great pianist, singer, songwriter, and producer. Toussaint began playing music at the age of 7 and throughout his career  collaborated with a who's who of the {place: New Orleans} scene: {artist: Dr. John}, {artist: Huey Smith}, {artist: Irma Thomas}, {artist: Earl King} & many more. The piano man also wrote dozens of classic songs that have since entered the rock canon, having been covered by artists like {artist: Robert Plant and Alison Krauss}, {artist: DEVO}, {artist: Warren Zevon}, and {artist: Patti Labelle}. Allen joined {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} in the studio after the release of his album {album: Songbook}, a live recording that documents his career via a series of solo piano shows at {place: Joe's Pub} in {place: New York City}. Allen talked about about the origins of his most popular songs like "{track: Fortune Teller}" and "{track: Working in a Coal Mine}," as well as "{track: Whipped Cream}," which became the theme for {tag: The Dating Game}.


## 00:48:22 Review: The Chills
![Silver Bullets](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music1/v4/1c/8a/a0/1c8aa0f4-a226-4d05-52ca-550424a518c5/source/600x600bb.jpg "60273058/1024625297")
If you aren't familiar with {artist: The Chills}, chances are you aren't entrenched in the {place: New Zealand} {genre: indie rock} scene â€“not to mention this is first full-length album the group has put out in nearly two decades. The Chills are credited for popularizing the {genre: kiwi pop} sound that emerged in New Zealand during the {era: 1980s}. It was a marked departure from the indie rock that was prevalent in the {place: U.S.} at the time and an original sound altogether. Greg was unsure what to expect from The Chills, as he hasn't heard a full-length album from them since 1996s {album: Sunburnt}. But he's happy to report singer/songwriter {name: Martin Phillips} is back. As a result of battling drug addiction and illness, Phillips' lyrics are dark and introspective. The album conveys a sense of urgency to appreciate life's good things, and to {host: Greg}, Phillips sounds like a man renewed. {host: Jim} also likes the subtle touches of violin, timpani roll and chiming guitar. The song "{track: America Says Hello}" makes a political statement that is more direct than anything else Jim has heard from The Chills, so it's an enthusiastic Double {tag: Buy It} for {album: Silver Bullets}.
