## 00:01:53 News: 11.5.2010
Taylor to Kanye: Nanny nanny boo boo. The country pop singer has reason to gloat this week. First week sales for {artist: Taylor Swift}'s album {album: Speak Now} hit a million in only its first week. Only 16 albums have achieved this feat since {tag: SoundScan} began tracking sales in {era: 1991}. And, Jim and Greg add, this is especially significant in an age when digital music is king.

Also in the news is the death of {name: Ari Up}, one of the founders of the influential female {genre: punk} band {artist: The Slits}. Born Ariana Forster, the singer had a long battle with cancer, and her death was announced by her stepfather, and fellow {genre: punk} icon, {name: John Lydon}. Forster was just 14 years old when she put together the band that would later merge {genre: dub reggae} with {genre: punk}. Jim and Greg play {artist: The Slits}' "{track: Typical Girls}" to honor a girl that was anything but.

## 00:09:04 Interview: Best Coast
{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} are joined by the members of {artist: Best Coast}. The {genre: indie} trio, named for {tag: lead singer} {name: Bethany Cosentino}'s beloved {place: California} region, has a unique combination of {genre: shoegaze} rock and {era: '60s} throwback harmonies reminiscent of the {artist: Beach Boys} and the {artist: Mamas and the Papas}. Their debut {album: Crazy for You} was a surprise hit for an indie release-reaching the {tag: Billboard} Top 40. Cosentino talks to Jim and Greg about her own musical roots (Dad performed with {era: 70's} {genre: rock} band {artist: War}), rock heroes ({name: Stevie Nicks}) and personal writing style. She's joined by band mates {name: Bobb Bruno} on {tag: guitar}s and {name: Ali Koehler}, formerly of {artist: The Vivian Girls}, on {tag: drum[er]}s for a live performance in the studio. 

## 00:40:39 Review: Bryan Ferry
![Olympia](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music7/v4/f0/74/78/f074786b-3d66-76a5-52ea-68145fe981bf/source/600x600bb.jpg "14139137/1021793471")
There are few figures in rock as cool as {artist: Bryan Ferry}. This remains the case even 30 years after the break-up of {artist: Roxy Music}. Now {name: [Bryan] Ferry} is back with a new solo album, {album: Olympia}, which is comprised of mostly original material - a rarity for a singer who takes such command of covers. {host: Greg} explains that it would be no overstatement to say that Roxy Music changed the face of {genre: rock 'n' roll}. But there hasn't been a lot of changing of Ferry's sound since then. {host: Jim} agrees. He's still combining sly humor, sex appeal and lounge singer style. But this consistency is still great, and {album: Olympia} gets a double {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:47:48 Review: Kid Cudi
![Man On the Moon, Vol. II: The Legend of Mr. Rager (Bonus Track Version)](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/53/73/6d/53736dca-1a5c-0ad3-9be9-d5e83cbef9f3/source/600x600bb.jpg "273058501/399175175")
Bringing us full circle, we again think of {artist: Kanye West}. But this time, we don't ponder his dismissal of {artist: Taylor Swift}, but rather his influence on a new movement of introspective hip hop. {artist: Drake}, {artist: Lupe Fiasco} and now {artist: Kid Cudi} are all embracing self-examination, as well as {tag: rock and roll}. And, explains Greg, Cudi is the great existentialist. His new album, {album: Man on the Moon II: The Legend Of Mr. Rager}, is a continuation of his last concept [album](/show/200/review/Kidcudi). It is full of interesting narratives, wordplay, rock instrumentation and cameos. Both {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} are hugely impressed and give the record another double {tag: Buy It}.
