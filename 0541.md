![Tax Day](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2016/taxday_web.jpg)

More like H&R Rock: Nothing improves the irritation of filing taxes like a good soundtrack. As we prepare to give back to Uncle Sam, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} carry out an audit of the best songs for {tag: Tax Day}. Then, they review the new album from veteran {place: British} rocker {artist: PJ Harvey}.

After fifteen years on the air, "{tag: American Idol}" is being voted off. The pop cultural juggernaut ruled the airwaves for years, producing stars like {artist: Kelly Clarkson}, {artist: Carrie Underwood}, and {artist: Jennifer Hudson} (along with plenty of forgettable "idols"). The show averaged 31.1 million viewers a week in {era: 2006}, but ratings during this final season are not even a third of that mark. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} note the significance of  "Idol,"  but won't miss the overemotive style of singing it promoted. The show's legacy, in any case, lives on in newer programs like "{tag: The Voice}."

## Review: PJ Harvey
![The Hope Six Demolition Project](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music49/v4/d4/d6/de/d4d6dee7-51bd-ca72-f424-b047590f87de/source/600x600bb.jpg)
English singer-songwriter {artist: PJ Harvey}'s newest album, {album: The Hope Six Demolition Project}, drops April 15. This is her ninth album, and {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} have been following her from the beginning. The self-taught musician came into the spotlight in {era: 1991} and debuted her album {album: Dry} in 1992 to critical acclaim. On this new album, Harvey pulls inspiration from her travels to {place: Kosovo}, {place: Afghanistan} and {place: Washington D.C.}, where she observed local politics and infused her thoughts on them into her songwriting.
Greg notes that her writing style has changed in the past few albums. It was during her eighth album, {album: Let England Shake} that she transformed into a storyteller, and that approach comes through on *The Hope Six Demolition Project* as well. She's an outsider looking in, but her reporting is still personal. Greg appreciates the emotional core of the record as well as the uplifting melodies that color her bleak accounts. *The Hope Six Demolition Project* is a {tag: Buy It} for Greg.
Jim agrees, taking note that the theatricality of her third album {album: To Bring You My Love} returns in this album. Harvey also introduces an anthemic quality-- her passion and anger are audible, and Jim loves it, making *The Hope Six Demolition Project* an enthusiastic double {tag: Buy It}. 



## DIJ: Greg

{host: Greg} takes a trip to the {tag: desert island} tax shelter this week. Lately, he's been thinking a lot about the rock band {artist: The Vulgar Boatmen}. The group began in {place: Florida}/{place: Indiana} in the {era: early 1980s} when a University of Florida professor teamed up with one of his former students. They made some cassette-only records before making full albums in {era: 1989} and {era: 1992}. The 25th anniversary re-issue of their first album, {album: You and Your Sister}, came out a few months ago. Greg started listening to that record again, as well as 1992's {album: Please Panic}. The song he chose was a track from their '92 record called "{track: You Don't Love Me Yet}." He feels the song exudes all the uncertainty and cautiousness surrounding love and thought it would be the perfect song to hear on the desert island.
