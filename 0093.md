# Show 93: Kanye West vs. 50 Cent
It's the first great rock battle of the year: {artist: Kanye West} vs. {artist: 50 Cent}. Both rappers have new albums coming out on the same day, so {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} will pit the {genre: hip hop} heavyweights up against one another to see who comes out on top.

## 00:01:45 News: 09.07.07
Each week there are more and more news stories about the failings of the music industry and labels having financial troubles. This week's victim is {tag: Bertelsmann}, the largest media company in {place: Europe}. The German-based company reported a $69 million loss due to legal settlements over the funding of music-downloading service {tag: Napster}. In 2004, in an effort to stay ahead in the growing digital industry, Bertelsmann invested in the file-sharing company. But, shortly thereafter, the other major music labels sued Napster for copyright infringement. Now Bertelsmann is paying the price.

It's clear that the industry's old model is dying though, and two music veterans think they have the solution. Jim and Greg discuss the much talked-about profile of {name: Rick Rubin} in last week's New York Times Magazine. Rubin, who co-founded {label: Def Jam} and launched the careers of artists like {artist: The Beastie Boys} and {artist: Slayer}, was recently appointed the co-head of {label: Columbia Records}. In the article, writer {name: Lynn Hirschberg} talks to Rubin about how he plans to save Columbia, and possibly the entire music business. In addition to implementing a subscription-based music service, the crux of Rubin's grand scheme is to put the focus back on quality and back on quality and the art. Jim and Greg completely agree that the key to pleasing music consumers is having better music, but they question Rubin's role as tastemaker. The man has had a golden ear at times, but, as Jim explains, he's also produced a lot of "crap."

Another music man who commented on the state of the union is {label: Creation Records} founder {name: Alan McGee}. In a blog in the UK newspaper The Guardian, McGee proclaims that consumers don't want to pay for music at all anymore. Period. He recommends that labels invest in the scope of an artist's career and focus on making money through ticket sales and merchandise, not small worthless discs.

In more news about the money-making of music, {tag: BMI} announced record-setting royalty distributions to the tune of $732 million. But, while the music performing right organization is reporting its success, another is seeking more funds. Earlier this summer {tag: ASCAP} announced that it has filed 26 separate infringement actions against nightclubs, bars and restaurants in 17 states. Jim and Greg are curious about the goal of the crackdown, which seems to focus on the little guy. First they talk to {name: Vincent Candilora}, ASCAP's vice president and director of licensing. Mr. Candilora explains that ASCAP doesn't desire filing lawsuits, but that the organization wanted to remind people that there are laws against playing copyrighted music without a license, whether the song is recorded or performed, and whether the venue is large or a dive bar. He realizes that most of these establishments aren't specifically music venues, but compares paying for the right to play music to paying for the right to serve parsley; it's not something you order off a menu, but it's something that's included in a business' operating cost.

{name: Mike Miller}, owner of the bar Delilah's on the north side of {place: Chicago}, gives the other perspective. He explains that as a music fan and a supporter of the local music community, he is totally happy to do his part and pay licenses to all three performing rights organizations. But, Mike is dubious about how his payments get disseminated. He also questions the effectiveness of such lawsuits, and wonders if ASCAP can do something better to support individual musicians and the community-at-large.

## 00:21:45 Review: 50 Cent
![Curtis](//static.soundopinions.org/assets/93/1090.jpg "112058/269576594")
Jim and Greg review two of the biggest releases of the year this week starting with {album: Curtis} from {artist: 50 Cent}. This is the third album for the {artist: Dr. Dre} protégé, who has been very vocal about his violent, drug-filled past. In fact, on this album, he isn't vocal about anything else. {host: Jim} is completely disappointed in the rapper's creativity and calls him a "cartoon character." Greg also hoped for more from the man who many thought would fill the shoes left by the {artist: Notorious B.I.G.} He finds 50 Cent's delivery deadpan, joyless and obnoxious. One track in particular, "{track: Straight to the Bank}," made {host: Greg} want to stick needles in his ears. We'd say that warrants a double {tag: Trash It}.

## 00:32:30 Review: Kanye West
![Graduation](//static.soundopinions.org/assets/93/1I60.jpg "2715720/401263134")
Another album to be released on the same day as {album: Curtis} is {album: Graduation} from {artist: Kanye West}. {artist: 50 Cent} has publicly challenged West in the sales department, but when it comes to the music, Jim and Greg think there's no contest. The rapper/producer's third album and "dissertation" shows that not only has he grown as a rapper, but also as a producer. {host: Jim} calls the album a smorgasbord of sounds and a departure from the traditional Kanye West {genre: soul} sample formula. He thinks {album: Graduation} is musically brilliant, and definitely recommends listeners {tag: Buy It}. {host: Greg} is also impressed with this album. Kanye is an innovator sonically, but also demonstrates a complexity in his lyrics. Where 50 Cent denies he has any weaknesses, Kanye broadcasts them. This is evident in the album's closing track, "{track: Big Brother}," which Greg calls one of the best songs Kanye has ever done lyrically. He also gives {album: Graduation} a Buy It. 

## 00:44:28 Review: The Mekons
![Natural](//static.soundopinions.org/assets/93/2240.jpg "14944197/1120079814")
The final album up for review is less high-profile, but no less worth your time according to Jim and Greg. {place: Leeds}-born, {place: Chicago}-based band {artist: The Mekons} have a new album out called {album: Natural}. Pioneers and survivors of {place: England}'s {genre: punk} era, the Mekons have been making music together for thirty years now, and for this effort they gathered in the English countryside to record. You can hear this "natural" approach in the live sound of the record. This also accounts for the album's accessibility despite many of the songs' dark themes. {host: Greg} calls {album: Natural} one of the band's bleakest albums, but also one of the prettiest. {host: Jim} agrees that the record is gorgeous, and not off-putting. If you are new to the Mekons, this is as good a place to start as any. Both critics give {album: Natural} a {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:50:56 DIJ: Greg
{artist: The Mekons}' 30-year run is an impressive one, especially when you consider that the dominant story in rock is one of instant and fleeting fame. An example of this is the {artist: Johnny Burnette Rock 'N Roll Trio}, the band behind Greg's {tag: Desert Island Jukebox} pick this week. The {place: Memphis} trio comprised of the Burnette brothers and their friend {name: Paul Burlison} only had one recording session in the {era: mid-'50s}, but for that brief period they were all the rage. Johnny Burnette was Elvis and then some, and Burlison had a completely unique and groundbreaking guitar style. You can hear this on the song "{track: Train Kept A-Rollin'}," a {name: Tiny Bradshaw}-penned tune, that has since been covered by everyone from {artist: Led Zeppelin} to {artist: Aerosmith} to {artist: Motörhead}. But it's The Johnny Burnette Rock 'N Roll Trio version that deserves a slot in Desert Island Jukebox.
