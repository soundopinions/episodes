{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} mark the beginning of a new year by looking at the decade past. Tune in to hear their thoughts on the most important musical moments of the {era: 2000's}. Plus, they present their ultimate {tag: Mixtapes of the Decade}.

## 00:01:45 News: 1.1.2010
First in the news, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} discuss a story emerging out of the next decade. They talk to {tag: Wired} {tag: writer} {name: Eliot Van Buskirk} about his recent piece on the "{tag: Copyright Time Bomb}." As Eliot explains to Jim and Greg, the {tag: U.S. Copyright Act of 1976} poses a new threat to the major label system. Songs copyrighted after 1978 can be terminated by the author in 2013 (1979 in 2014, etc.) That means that if a musician sold his or her work to a label after 1978, they can choose to take it back and manage it independently in the next decade. Many labels rely on back cataloge revenue, so this will be a big hit to them. In addition, it may be another reason an artist chooses to go it independently and without a label.

Jim and Greg couldn't welcome 2010 without looking at the decade past. The {era: 2000s} brought us {artist: N'Sync} and the {tag: boy band explosion}, but they also ushered in great change in terms of business and technology. As Jim and Greg discuss, advances in {tag: digital music} were at the heart of all the decade's major news-from lawsuits ({tag: Metallica vs. Napster}, {tag: RIAA vs. consumers}) to innovation in sound, marketing and distribution ({artist: Wilco}, {artist: Radiohead}, {artist: Nine Inch Nails}). And while the Aughts were a time of {tag: industry revolution}, there wasn't necessarily a revolutionary sound. Jim thinks people may have been too shocked by technology to create something comparable to a {genre: punk}, {genre: disco} or {genre: grunge} movement. But he and Greg are hopeful that something great is just waiting to come out of a basement near you.
