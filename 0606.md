## 00:01:45 Special: 1977 - The Year Punk Broke
This week, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} kick off a two-part {tag: series} about one seminal year in rock history, {tag: 1977: The Year Punk Broke}. In this episode, they tackle the {genre: punk} explosion in the {place: U.K.} with help from music writer {name: Jon Savage}. (Many consider Savage's {tag: *England's Dreaming*} to be the definitive book on this period.) So what made punk explode in 1977? Terrible pop songs, the entrance of {artist: The Ramones} and the rise of groups like the {artist: Buzzcocks} and {artist: Sex Pistols}.

Jim and Greg close out 1977 Part One by playing two favorite songs from that year. {host: Greg} goes out with {artist: The Adverts}' "{track: One Chord Wonder}." {host: Jim} goes with the {artist: Wire} track "{track: Ex-Lion Tamer}" from one of his favorite records of all time, {album: Pink Flag}. 


## 00:45:03Review: Fleet Foxes
![Crack-Up](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music82/v4/27/7e/28/277e2874-3ede-d0f2-cd06-3661a27734ee/source/600x600bb.jpg "275727569/1209098746")


{artist: Fleet Foxes} helped create a {place: Pacific Northwest}-based {genre: folk-rock} movement in the early aughts that featured acts like {artist: Blitzen Trapper} and {artist: Bon Iver}. Greg says that on their first record, "Fleet Foxes did it brilliantly, more brilliantly than any of them." He goes on to say that their latest record, {album: Crack-Up}, doesn't fare as well. {host: Greg} says "some emotional intensity that [he] so loved about the band has gotten lost amid those serpentine arrangements that they are putting together". He says give it a {tag: Try It}.
*Crack-Up* was released after a six-year hiatus for the band, during which lead singer/guitarist {artist: Robin Pecknold} attended school at Columbia University. Jim says though he generally likes Fleet Foxes, on this album there is a lot of "mid-tempo snooziness". He adds that he doesn't know why Pecknold decided to come back from his hiatus, because Pecknold "has nothing new to say". {host: Jim} gives the record a {tag: Trash It}.


## 00:51:04 Feature: Hooked On Sonics: Jody Stephens of Big Star
{tag: Hooked on Sonics} is a segment where musicians share the songs that made them fall in love with music. Drummer {artist: Jody Stephens} helped form pivotal {place: Memphis} {genre: rock} group {artist: Big Star}, alongside vocalist and songwriter {artist: Alex Chilton}. Big Star, is, in many ways, more famous now than they were during their first {era: 1970s} incarnation. In the {era: 1980s} and {era: 1990s}, a whole new generation discovered the group after {artist: The Replacements} and {artist: REM} cited them as influences.
Today, Jody works at the famous {place: Ardent Studios} down in Memphis; but as a kid, it was music from a completely different part of the world that got him Hooked on Sonics. That song was {track: I Want to Hold Your Hand} by {artist: The Beatles}. But, as you'll hear, it all came around full circle.
