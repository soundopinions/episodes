# Show 194: Supergroups & Opinions on Mos Def
Mix one famous musician and stir in some others. The results can be a recipe for success, or disaster. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} discuss {genre: rock}'s best and worst {tag: Supergroups}. Then, they review the newest album from {artist: Mos Def}.

## 00:02:04 News: 08.14.09
First up in the news, {tag: Pepsi} is launching a music label in {place: China}. This is a strange, but perhaps smart move considering the large, untapped market there. The soda company will produce a "{tag: Battle of the Bands}" television show to find artists to record. In addition, those artists will be featured in Pepsi ads.

Two sad news items follow. First is the death of {artist: Mink DeVille} frontman {name: Willy DeVille}. DeVille was one of the key artists from the {tag: CBGB} {genre: punk} scene. But, he distinguished himself from the {artist: Blondie}s and {artist: Ramones} with his unique sound. He was more a child of the {tag: Brill Building} music of the {era: '60s}, and actually introduced {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} to a lot of those influences. To honor DeVille they play his {name: Jack Nitzsche}-produced track "{track: Spanish Stroll}."

![John Hughes](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/194/3G0.jpg)Another recent death is that of director, writer and producer {name: John Hughes}. While Hughes isn't necessarily a music figure, Jim and Greg know that he was a huge fan. His musical choices in films like "{tag: The Breakfast Club}" and "{tag: Sixteen Candles}" influenced what young people heard, and for many teens it was their first exposure to "{genre: alternative}" music. In honor of Hughes, Jim and Greg play the original version of "{track: Pretty in Pink}," by the {artist: Psychedelic Furs}.

## 00:13:45 Special: Supergroups
{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} ponder the history of the {tag: supergroup}. This is the rock phenomenon where musicians from different bands join together to form a new group. Sometimes this is a great success, and sometimes the ingredients just don't mix. Recently there have been a number of new supergroups such as {artist: Them Crooked Vultures}, {artist: Tinted Windows}, {artist: Dead Weather} and {artist: Monsters of Folk}. For Jim the keys to a winning supergroup are that the members be individually "super," and that they have chemistry together. Greg adds that there needs to be more compelling the super-union than just business.

Here are some hits and misses throughout history:

- {artist: Traveling Wilburys}
- {artist: Chickenfoot}
- {artist: Million Dollar Quartet}
- {artist: Cream}
- {artist: Blind Faith}
- {artist: Crosby, Stills, Nash (and Young)}
- {artist: UK}
- {artist: Golden Palomino}
- {artist: Electronic}
- {artist: Temple of the Dog}
- {artist: Audioslave}
- {artist: Lucy Pearl}

## 00:49:26 Review: Mos Def
![The Ecstatic](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/194/2AE0.jpg)
{artist: Mos Def} first gained attention as a member of {artist: Black Star} with fellow rapper {artist: Talib Kweli}. He went on to have a successful solo career, but these days more people might recognize him as an actor than a musician. Now he is back with {album: The Ecstatic}. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} both thought his {genre: rap} career was all but over, so this record was a welcome surprise. Jim heard it more like an unfocused {tag: mixtape} than an album, but he loved Mos Def's energy and the work of his producers. Greg found the rapper more engaged on this album and calls it a triumphant return to form. {album: The Ecstatic} gets two {tag: Buy It}s.
