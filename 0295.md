# Show 295: Bob Mould & Opinions on Brian Eno

{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} sit down with influential {tag: singer}, {tag: songwriter} and {tag: guitarist} {artist: Bob Mould} of {artist: Hüsker Dü} and {artist: Sugar}. Mould's new book {tag: *See a Little Light*} traces his life and career. Later it's Greg's turn at the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}.

## 00:01:52 Intro: Music News
Attention {place: America}n music fans: {tag: Spotify} has landed. The "freemium" {tag: music-streaming service}, launched in {place: Sweden} in 2008, already dominates music streaming overseas. Not only does it claim 10 million (until now, mostly European) users, but of that ten, a significant 1.6 million are paying subscribers. So why did it take so long for Spotify to cross the pond? For years the service has been negotiating with the big four American record labels to overcome licensing hurdles, leaving the American field open to rival services like {tag: Rdio}, {tag: MOG}, and {tag: Rhapsody}. {host: Greg} wonders: Will Spotify - with its vaunted 15 million track catalogue, free music, and free-ish subscription plans - be able to compete with these already entrenched services?

It's not often that a major artist goes out of his way to urge fans NOT to buy his music, but that's exactly what {artist: Nine Inch Nail}'s {artist: Trent Reznor} did last week, telling his approximately 930,000 {tag: Twitter} followers to "ignore" a reissue of 1989's {album: Pretty Hate Machine}. "A record label bulls--t move repackaging the old version" Reznor tweeted. "Ignore please." Reissues, Jim notes, are rarely the decision of the artists, who sign away rights to reissue material when they enter recording contracts. But as Greg observes, labels have something to lose too: this is exactly the kind of rip-off that earns them fans' ill will.

{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} close out the news with two short items: {artist: Ja Rule} was {tag: sentenced} this week to 28 months in {tag: prison} for failing to pay 1.1 million dollars in {tag: taxes}. It's yet another blow for a star who hasn't been "living it up" since he started serving two years for criminal weapons possession last month. The {place: New Jersey} judge ruled that Ja Rule could serve the terms concurrently. And while we're on the subject of downward slides, {tag: Border's Books and Music} just hit rock bottom. One of the few remaining large music retailers (anyone remember {tag: Tower}?), Borders announced Monday that it would {tag: close} its doors for good.

## 00:08:38 Interview: Bob Mould

Like most breakups, band breakups can be agonizing and traumatic, but also opportunities for self-reflection and reinvention. This week {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} talk to {artist: Hüsker Dü} songwriter and {tag: guitarist} {name: Bob Mould} about the breakup of his band - on the cusp of what many believed would be their mainstream breakthrough - and his subsequent reinvention as a solo artist. It's a period Mould talks about in his new memoir, {tag: *See a Little Light*}, though he rarely discusses it in person. Aside from being one of the most rousing live {genre: rock n' roll} acts around, {place: Minnesota}'s Hüsker Dü was amazingly prolific. With Mould on {tag: guitar}, {name: Grant Hart} on {tag: drums}, and {name: Greg Norton} on {tag: bass}, the band took {genre: punk} velocity and {genre: pop} craft to superhuman levels on a series of significant releases between 1984 and 1986: {album: Zen Arcade}, {album: New Day Rising}, {album: Flip Your Wig}, and {album: Candy Apple Grey}. But as Mould recalls, after the band's move to a major label, personal relationships, competition, and addiction proved to be toxic. The crisis came after a disastrous {era: 1987} performance in {place: Columbia, Missouri}, when Hart's drug use brought the show to a halt. It was the period, Mould emphasizes, at the end of a very long sentence. The band broke up shortly thereafter. Bob also discusses his retreat to rural Minnesota, where he began experimenting with new instruments and alternate tunings. In {era: 1989}, he would re-emerge as a solo artist with another great album, {album: Workbook}.

## 00:44:39 Review: Brian Eno
![Drums Between the Bells (Bonus Track Version)](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/295/22F0.jpg)
And now it's time for everyone's favorite {tag: Sound Opinions} drinking game: How many times can {host: Jim} name-drop {artist: Brian Eno}? But let it be known that these mentions are entirely warranted. Jim's favorite "Super Genius" is out with a new record, {album: Drums Between the Bells}, a collaboration with the {tag: British} {tag: poet} {name: Rick Holland}. Eno has a been a major influence in the music world since the early seventies, first as a member of {artist: Roxy Music}, then as a solo artist and ambient music innovator, and most recently as a {tag: producer} for industry powerhouses like {artist: U2} and {artist: Coldplay}. First to the plate to review {album: Drums Between the Bells} is Jim, who wants to set the record straight. He's no slavish Eno devotee, though he's championed the artist at his best. Unfortunately Eno's best isn't what Jim gets on "Drums." The album is part ambient music - perfectly fine for what it is, but Jim misses the vocal gravitas that Eno himself might have brought to Holland's poetry (instead, Eno has regular folks - non-actors and singers - speaking Holland's lines). Jim gives Drums a {tag: Burn it}. {host: Greg} agrees, calling the album's vocals a little too dry. But he was intrigued enough by all the interesting rhythmic work on Drums to give the album a Burn it.


## 00:50:33 DIJ: Greg
Bummed by what he sees as {artist: Common}'s recent descent into mediocrity, Greg charts a craft for the desert island. He takes us back to the {place: Chicago} rapper's glory days in the early nineties, when he released "{track: I Used To Love H.E.R.}". SHE - if you haven't already guessed it - isn't a woman. She's a metaphor for the golden age of {genre: hip-hop} (H.E.R. stands for Hearing Every Rhyme). Common loved that scrappy city kid who grew up to be a beautiful Afrocentric woman in New York City, and he's disappointed when she goes West Coast and gets corrupted by show biz. There's more than a bit of irony here. As Greg reminds us, Common's lament for classic hip-hop is a hip-hop classic.
