# Show 20: Spring 2006 Review Roundup

This week on Sound Opinions: Review-a-Palooza. Jim and Greg will look at some of the best and worst albums to be released this Spring including the new releases from the {artist : Yeah Yeah Yeahs}, {artist : Morrissey}, {artist : The Secret Machines} and {artist : Ghostface Killah}.

![Spring 2006 Record Reviews](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2010/vinyl%20records.jpg)



## 00:02:44 Review: The Secret Machines

![Ten Silver Drops](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/20/4K0.jpg)

The first album up for review is {album : Ten Silver Drops} by {artist : The Secret Machines}. This is the second album by the {genre : psychedelic}  {place : Dallas} band (now based in {place : Brooklyn}). Their previous release, {album : Now Here is Nowhere}, earned quite a bit of praise and won them some impressive fans. In fact, {name : Bob Ezrin}, who produced {artist : Pink Floyd}'s {album : The Wall}, even offered to handle {album : Ten Silver Drops}. The band decided to go it alone, however, and {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} manage to agree on the results. For them the album is full of strong melodies, surprising harmonies, and {name : Josh Garza}'s signature seismic drumming. Both critics believe they may have surpassed their debut album and give this go-around a {tag : Buy It} rating.



## 00:09:12 Review: Morrissey

![Ringleader of the Tormentors](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/20/FC0.jpg)

Mythical. Mopey. Maudlin. Just some of the words used to describe that other {place : Irish}  {genre : pop} [God](http://www.believermag.com/exclusives/?read=article_veltman

) -- {artist : Morrissey}. But after listening to his new album {album : Ringleader of the Tormentors}, you might have to add lustful to the mix. Morrissey has been famously celibate for a number of years, and that torment served him well. But now he not only admits to sexual trysts in {place : Rome}, but makes his own proclivities less ambiguous than in the past. The result gets a {tag : Burn It} rating from both hosts, but for very different reasons. {host : Jim} finds Morrissey's lyrics as biting as ever, but is not impressed with his sonic decisions. {host : Greg}, on the other hand, believes a miserable Morrissey is a better Morrissey, but really appreciates the music, which was produced by former {artist : [David] Bowie} and {artist : T. Rex} collaborator {name : Tony Visconti}.



## 00:21:45 Review: Yeah Yeah Yeahs

![Show Your Bones](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/20/1090.jpg)

Next up is {artist : Yeah Yeah Yeahs}. This {place : Brooklyn} trio has released {album : Show Your Bones}, the highly anticipated follow-up to their debut, {album : Fever to Tell}. That successful album produced a hit single, "{track : Maps}," and made the band one of the poster children for the {genre : new-garage} (or {genre : new-new wave}) scene in {place : New York City}. Jim is always skeptical of this scene and of hype in general, but really liked {album : Show Your Bones}. He's not sure what lead singer {name : Karen O} is singing about, but loves her energy, which channels a combination of {name : Siouxsie Sioux} and {name : Chrissie Hynde}. Guitar wizard {name : Nick Zinner} is also back in top form. Therefore it's a {tag : Buy It} for {host : Jim}. {host : Greg}, however, can only give this disc, which was produced by {genre : hip hop} producer {name : Squeak-E-Clean}, a {tag : Burn It} rating. He thinks there are a number of great tracks, but the songwriting just isn't there.



## 00:29:51 Review: The Fiery Furnaces

![Bitter Tea](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/20/1DR0.jpg)

The critical discussion really starts to get good with this next album. {place : Oak Park} natives {name : Matthew [Friedberger]} and {name : Eleanor Friedberger}, otherwise known as {artist : The Fiery Furnaces}, have just released their fifth full album, {album : Bitter Tea}, and our hosts could not disagree more. Jim has never been a huge fan of this sister and brother team, but this album just irritates the heck out of him. He finds it pointlessly eclectic, pretentious and basically unlistenable. {host : Greg} argues that {host : Jim} simply has the attention span of an ant. He loves {album : Bitter Tea}, and asks listeners to take their time with this one. Greg points to Eleanor's terrific {artist : Patti Smith}-like vocals and Matthew's inventive, theatrical songwriting. It's a {tag : Trash It} for Jim, but a {tag : Buy It} for Greg.



## 00:41:06 Review: Ghostface Killah

![Fishscale](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/20/1WI0.jpg)

{artist : Wu-Tang Clan} member {artist : Ghostface Killah} also has a new album out. {album : Fishscale} is the fifth solo record for this {genre : hip hop} veteran, who joined the Wu-Tang Clan over a decade ago. Ghostface has always been known as a complicated, skilled lyricist, and he lives up to his reputation on this release. {album : Fishscale}, itself a slang term for uncut cocaine, gives a narrative of life on the streets in {place : New York}. These stories are paired with samples and beats from producers like {name : Jay Dilla}, {name : Pete Rock} and {name : Just Blaze}. Listen to the sample of a blaxsploitation-style education film in the track we play, "{track : Kilo}." Incidentally, this is the first Ghostface solo album without any production from fellow Clansman {name : RZA}. Whether or not that bodes in Ghostface's favor is up to our hosts. {host : Jim} believes {genre : gangsta rap} and songs about drug dealing are pretty played out, but admits that Ghostface brings something completely new. He compares the rapper to writer {name : Jim Thompson} and gives {album : Fishscale} a {tag : Burn It}. {host : Greg} has to go with a {tag : Buy It} rating. He is compelled by the stories of Ghostface's childhood, the surreal {genre : rap} tangents and the immense hooks. According to Greg, this record parallels early {artist : NWA} records and is not only one of the best albums of Ghostface's career, but of {era : 2006}.



## 00:50:22 Review: Pink

![I'm Not Dead](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/20/2BY0.jpg)

{artist : Pink} has the final album up for review during this week's show. {album : I'm Not Dead} is this pop riot grrrl's fourth album. Jim has always been a fan -- while other {genre : pop} starlets are not necessarily the best role models, Pink has always promoted {tag : feminism} and independence. On her first single, "{track : Stupid Girls}," Pink basically satirizes the behavior of her peers, and {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} both think it's a pretty smart pop song. The rest of the album falls short, however. Pink is a great role model, but on this record, not necessarily a great songwriter. Both hosts believe that the record is sad and leaden and that Pink is taking herself much too seriously. {album : I'm Not Dead} gets a double "{tag : Trash It}."
