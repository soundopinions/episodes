# Show 20: Spring 2006 Review Roundup
This week on Sound Opinions: Review-a-Palooza. Jim and Greg will look at some of the best and worst albums to be released this Spring including the new releases from the {artist: Yeah Yeah Yeahs}, {artist: Morrissey}, {artist: The Secret Machines} and {artist: Ghostface Killah}.

![Spring 2006 Record Reviews](http://static.soundopinions.org/images/2010/vinyl%20records.jpg)

## 00:02:44 Review: The Secret Machines
![Ten Silver Drops](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/bb/3a/3b/bb3a3b1e-c18d-719c-bcd2-658f062b0dc5/source/600x600bb.jpg "5305574/125004652")
The first album up for review is {album: Ten Silver Drops} by {artist: The Secret Machines}. This is the second album by the {genre: psychedelic} {place: Dallas} band (now based in {place: Brooklyn}). Their previous release, {album: Now Here is Nowhere}, earned quite a bit of praise and won them some impressive fans. In fact, {name: Bob Ezrin}, who produced {artist: Pink Floyd}'s {album: The Wall}, even offered to handle {album: Ten Silver Drops}. The band decided to go it alone, however, and {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} manage to agree on the results. For them the album is full of strong melodies, surprising harmonies, and {name: Josh Garza}'s signature seismic drumming. Both critics believe they may have surpassed their debut album and give this go-around a {tag: Buy It} rating.

## 00:09:12 Review: Morrissey
![Ringleader of the Tormentors](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2016/morrissey%202.jpg)
Mythical. Mopey. Maudlin. Just some of the words used to describe that other {place: Irish} {genre: pop} [God](http://www.believermag.com/exclusives/?read=article_veltman
) -- {artist: Morrissey}. But after listening to his new album {album: Ringleader of the Tormentors}, you might have to add lustful to the mix. Morrissey has been famously celibate for a number of years, and that torment served him well. But now he not only admits to sexual trysts in {place: Rome}, but makes his own proclivities less ambiguous than in the past. The result gets a {tag: Burn It} rating from both hosts, but for very different reasons. {host: Jim} finds Morrissey's lyrics as biting as ever, but is not impressed with his sonic decisions. {host: Greg}, on the other hand, believes a miserable Morrissey is a better Morrissey, but really appreciates the music, which was produced by former {artist: [David] Bowie} and {artist: T. Rex} collaborator {name: Tony Visconti}.

## 00:21:45 Review: Yeah Yeah Yeahs
![Show Your Bones](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/f5/44/22/f54422a5-dad2-cdb3-2a67-59645de6d64b/source/600x600bb.jpg "1265171/131273690")
Next up is {artist: Yeah Yeah Yeahs}. This {place: Brooklyn} trio has released {album: Show Your Bones}, the highly anticipated follow-up to their debut, {album: Fever to Tell}. That successful album produced a hit single, "{track: Maps}," and made the band one of the poster children for the {genre: new-garage} (or {genre: new-new wave}) scene in {place: New York City}. Jim is always skeptical of this scene and of hype in general, but really liked {album: Show Your Bones}. He's not sure what lead singer {name: Karen O} is singing about, but loves her energy, which channels a combination of {name: Siouxsie Sioux} and {name: Chrissie Hynde}. Guitar wizard {name: Nick Zinner} is also back in top form. Therefore it's a {tag: Buy It} for {host: Jim}. {host: Greg}, however, can only give this disc, which was produced by {genre: hip hop} producer {name: Squeak-E-Clean}, a {tag: Burn It} rating. He thinks there are a number of great tracks, but the songwriting just isn't there.

## 00:29:51 Review: The Fiery Furnaces
![Bitter Tea](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music69/v4/84/c3/54/84c3545c-0718-5d9c-d4d7-cd1ea98e911c/source/600x600bb.jpg "5543027/1051557397")
The critical discussion really starts to get good with this next album. {place: Oak Park} natives {name: Matthew [Friedberger]} and {name: Eleanor Friedberger}, otherwise known as {artist: The Fiery Furnaces}, have just released their fifth full album, {album: Bitter Tea}, and our hosts could not disagree more. Jim has never been a huge fan of this sister and brother team, but this album just irritates the heck out of him. He finds it pointlessly eclectic, pretentious and basically unlistenable. {host: Greg} argues that {host: Jim} simply has the attention span of an ant. He loves {album: Bitter Tea}, and asks listeners to take their time with this one. Greg points to Eleanor's terrific {artist: Patti Smith}-like vocals and Matthew's inventive, theatrical songwriting. It's a {tag: Trash It} for Jim, but a {tag: Buy It} for Greg.

## 00:41:06 Review: Ghostface Killah
![Fishscale](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music20/v4/a0/97/76/a0977658-1efe-fb5c-f7d3-da30a55e6b1a/source/600x600bb.jpg "462455/135447339")
{artist: Wu-Tang Clan} member {artist: Ghostface Killah} also has a new album out. {album: Fishscale} is the fifth solo record for this {genre: hip hop} veteran, who joined the Wu-Tang Clan over a decade ago. Ghostface has always been known as a complicated, skilled lyricist, and he lives up to his reputation on this release. {album: Fishscale}, itself a slang term for uncut cocaine, gives a narrative of life on the streets in {place: New York}. These stories are paired with samples and beats from producers like {name: Jay Dilla}, {name: Pete Rock} and {name: Just Blaze}. Listen to the sample of a blaxsploitation-style education film in the track we play, "{track: Kilo}." Incidentally, this is the first Ghostface solo album without any production from fellow Clansman {name: RZA}. Whether or not that bodes in Ghostface's favor is up to our hosts. {host: Jim} believes {genre: gangsta rap} and songs about drug dealing are pretty played out, but admits that Ghostface brings something completely new. He compares the rapper to writer {name: Jim Thompson} and gives {album: Fishscale} a {tag: Burn It}. {host: Greg} has to go with a {tag: Buy It} rating. He is compelled by the stories of Ghostface's childhood, the surreal {genre: rap} tangents and the immense hooks. According to Greg, this record parallels early {artist: NWA} records and is not only one of the best albums of Ghostface's career, but of {era: 2006}.

## 00:50:22 Review: Pink
![I'm Not Dead](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/c6/cf/fc/c6cffc39-05ae-7fdf-58d0-acce61b742af/source/600x600bb.jpg "4488522/269446703")
{artist: Pink} has the final album up for review during this week's show. {album: I'm Not Dead} is this pop riot grrrl's fourth album. Jim has always been a fan -- while other {genre: pop} starlets are not necessarily the best role models, Pink has always promoted {tag: feminism} and independence. On her first single, "{track: Stupid Girls}," Pink basically satirizes the behavior of her peers, and {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} both think it's a pretty smart pop song. The rest of the album falls short, however. Pink is a great role model, but on this record, not necessarily a great songwriter. Both hosts believe that the record is sad and leaden and that Pink is taking herself much too seriously. {album: I'm Not Dead} gets a double "{tag: Trash It}."
