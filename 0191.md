# Show 191: Purple Rain & Opinions on The Dead Weather
Tune in for a {tag: Classic Album Dissection} of {artist: Prince}'s {album: Purple Rain}, now 25 years old. Later {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} review the debut album from {artist: Jack White}'s new quartet {artist: The Dead Weather}.

## 00:02:04 Intro: Music News
{artist: [The] Beastie Boys} member {name: Adam Yauch} announced this week that he has {tag: cancer} and will be undergoing surgery. He explained on a video on the group's site that the cancer was caught in time, and he will recover. The Beastie Boys are being forced to cancel a number of big tour dates, however, including headling slots at {tag: Lollapalooza}, {tag: Austin City Limits} and {tag: All Points West} in {place: New Jersey}. Lollapalooza will not be offering refunds for tickets. As Greg explains, this is standard policy at many festivals where you are there to see dozens or hundreds of bands. Jim thinks that when a headline drops out, people should be able to get a refund, especially if they purchased tickets for just that one day.

It's only July, but {host: Jim} is already thinking about {tag: Christmas} gifts. He noticed that yet again, {host: Greg} missed an opportunity to get him the perfect gift -- {name: John Bonham}'s {tag: gong}. Bonzo's famous 48-inch gong went at auction this week for $64,000. Jim thinks it's a reasonable price for such a massive gong used by such a massive drummer.

## 00:05:58 Classic Album Dissection: Purple Rain

It's hard to believe, but {artist: Prince}'s blockbuster album {album: Purple Rain} is now celebrating its 25th anniversary. To honor this occasion {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} conduct a {tag: Classic Album Dissection}. They talk to former Revolution members {name: Wendy Melvoin} and {name: Lisa Coleman} about their relationship with Prince and the making of the album. {artist: Wendy & Lisa} are now a musical duo, and also score music for TV shows like {tag: Heroes} and {tag: Nurse Jackie}. But back in {era: 1984}, they were part of Prince's recording and performing team -- Wendy on guitar and Lisa on keyboards. As Jim and Greg explain, it was unique for Prince to be collaborative. He even shared songwriting credits with {artist: The Revolution}. Jim and Greg also credit {artist: Wendy and Lisa} with opening Prince up to new music and new sounds.

To cap off their dissection Jim and Greg talk about two specific songs from {album: Purple Rain}. Jim plays "{track: Darling Nikki}," one of the only songs on the album written solely by Prince. It was targeted by {name: Tipper Gore} and the {tag: PMRC} for its suggestive lyrics, but Jim sees it as a love/lust story similar to "{track: Norwegian Wood}." Greg plays "{track: When Doves Cry}." With no bass line, multiple guitar parts and a multi-tracked voice, it's an example of Prince's modern and {genre: avant-garde} side.

## 00:42:11 Review: The Dead Weather

Another year... another {name: Jack White} project. After {artist: The White Stripes} and {artist: The Raconteurs} comes {artist: The Dead Weather}. This time White has a more behind-the-scenes role as {tag: drummer} and producer. {artist: Alison Mosshart} of {artist: The Kills} is the {tag: lead vocalist}. {host: Jim} was let down by the second Raconteurs record, but he was blown away by the knockout, raw {genre: garage rock} on {album: Horehound}. He gives it a {tag: Buy It} rating. {host: Greg} is surprised to hear this. While he likes the sleezy, b-movie sound and vibe, he needs great songs to go with it. Greg looks forward to seeing the group live, but on record it's a {tag: Try It}.

## 00:48:44 DIJ: Jim
It's Jim's turn to add a song he can't live without to the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}. To honor the 40th anniversary of the moon landing, he chooses "{track: Ghosts of American Astronauts}" by {artist: The Mekons}. {host: Jim} was initially daunted by the {place: Chicago} {genre: punk}/{genre: alt-country} band. They've been going for three decades, so where do you start? {album: So Good It Hurts} was the doorway for him, and he discovered how smart, political and also seductive they can be on songs like "Ghosts of American Astronauts."
