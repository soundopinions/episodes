## 00:02:08 News: 05.27.06
Jim and Greg have resisted talking about {tag: American Idol} for quite a while, but this week this pop culture phenomenon couldn't be ignored. While these critics still don't care about the musical impact of the show, they can't deny its significance in the industry. An average of 25 million people tuned in each week to see who would be declared the {tag: American Idol}, commanding advertising rates that are only exceeded by the {tag: Super Bowl} and the {tag: Academy Awards}. For the music industry, this means major sales. Past contestants like {artist: Kelly Clarkson}, {artist: Carrie Underwood} and {artist: Clay Aiken} have sold 33 million records, and songs that appear on the show in any form immediately take off on the charts. Labels have taken note, sending aging artists like {artist: Rod Stewart}, {artist: Queen} and {artist: Barry Manilow}, as well as fresher faces like {artist: Shakira}, {artist: Mary J. Blige} and {artist: Prince}, to appear on the show. As much as both our hosts hope that audiences will decide to turn the dial toward something of better musical quality, Greg predicts that hipper acts in need of promotion will soon be calling up {tag: Fox}. And until then, fans can look forward to much of the [same](http://www.williamhung.net/). 

Fans who purchased {label: Sony} CDs by artists like {artist: The Foo Fighters}, {artist: The Coral}, {artist: Ray Charles} and {artist: Frank Sinatra} can rest easy. While those CDs may have infected your computer with a virus-like anti-piracy software called {tag: MediaMax}, a judge has ordered Sony to make up for it. Every customer infected with the software will receive a cash payment of $7.50 *and* one free album download or three free song downloads. Whoever claims that the record industry doesn'y care about the consumer obviously missed this news.

Rumor has it that {place: Sri Lanka}-born, {place: England}-based rapper {artist: M.I.A.} is being denied a visa to come to the United States. M.I.A., or {name: Maya Arulpragasam}, has plans to record with producer {name: Timbaland}, but may have to postpone them. Whether or not the denial is related to the fact that she is the daughter of a Sri Lankan Tamil Tiger rebel, or the fact that many of her song lyrics are overtly [political](http://www.lyricsmania.com/pull_up_the_people_lyrics_mia.html), is not known. What is known, however, is what a raw deal this is. While M.I.A., who has received masses of critical acclaim and was up for the prestigious {tag: Mercury Prize} in 2005, will not be gracing Americans with her presence, our own {artist: Snoop Dogg} has recently been barred from the U.K. Sound Opinions is willing to enter into diplomatic negotiations to work this out.

## 00:11:02 Review: Dixie Chicks
![Taking the Long Way](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music3/v4/7f/4b/5a/7f4b5afe-abf4-3e37-146f-220aea7a7286/dj.qnqtsdvw.jpg/600x600bb-85.jpg "635633/283636274")

Three years after telling a {place: London} audience, ""We're ashamed the President of the United States is from {place: Texas}," {name: Natalie Maines} and her fellow {artist: Dixie Chicks} are making headlines again with a new album. And, with singles like "{track: Not Ready to Make Nice}," the statement they want to make is clear. Some of their [critics](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2006-05-25-letters-dixiechicks_x.htm) might have desired an apology, but on {album: Taking the Long Way}, they receive no such thing. Because of this, the band is again being rejected by certain {genre: country} radio programmers. The real issue, however, is whether or not audiences will embrace the album, which is not a straight-up country record. Produced by {name: Rick Rubin}, and written with help from {artist: Sheryl Crow} and members of {artist: Semisonic} and {artist: The Jayhawks}, it has more of a {genre: California-rock} feel. {host: Jim} appreciates that they moved away from the {genre: Top 40 Country}, but wishes they had taken it even farther, towards a more authentic, {genre: alt-country} {genre: roots} sound like {artist: Jenny Lewis} or {artist: Neko Case}. He gives it a {tag: Burn It}. {host: Greg} is most taken with Natalie Maines' vocals, but also can't recommend that people buy the album. However, he does think that anyone interested in music should hear it and gives {album: Taking the Long Way} another {tag: Burn It}.

## 00:21:46 Interview: Common
This week on the show {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} meet with rapper {artist: Common}, who happens to be visiting his hometown. Common is currently touring to promote his sixth (and, some would say, best) album, {album: Be}. Jim and Greg note that most {genre: hip-hop} artists don't have his kind of longevity. In fact, Common is at an age where he has started to balance his career with fatherhood. Greg, who visited the set of Common's sultry [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCe1gC5VaW4&feature=kp) shoot for the song "{track: Go}," asks him how he'll be able to present his more adult side to his daughter. Fans of Common's videos should also check out his most recent, and most [cinematic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZRH68Ib1Ko), "{track: Testify}."

Common actually performs "{track: Testify}" live for our hosts. This song was produced by longtime collaborator and fellow southsider {name: Kanye West}, and includes the producer's signature use of soul samples. For {album: Be}, Common also worked with {name: ?uestlove} of {artist: The Roots} and rapper and producer {name: J Dilla}, who passed away just weeks before this interview. Dilla, or {name: Jay Dee}, has been a mainstay on the hip-hop scene, producing songs for {artist: De La Soul}, {artist: Pharcyde}, {artist: Janet Jackson}, and {artist: D'Angelo}. Dilla also worked with Common on {album: Like Water For Chocolate}, producing one of his biggest hits, "{track: The Light}." As Common explains, the loss of his friend and former roommate will be life-changing. And in his memory, the rapper does some freestyling over Dilla instrumentals -- a first for Sound Opinions.

## 00:47:07 Review: Mission of Burma
![The Obliterati](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/83/33/e8/8333e851-504f-93df-cc6d-0da44595cf8f/source/600x600bb.jpg "7206433/151470337")
{genre: Post-punk} pioneers {artist: Mission of Burma} have a new album out, their third in twenty years. Shortly after releasing their landmark {album: Vs.} in {era: 1982}, the group was forced to disband. The signature massive volume of their music took a toll on all of the members, particularly guitarist {name: Roger Miller} who developed a debilitating case of tinnitus. In their short run, {artist: Mission of Burma} became hugely influential; {artist: R.E.M.} and {artist: Moby} have both covered their songs. Then, in 2003 the band reunited and later released their second album, {album: OnOffOn}. This record was very well-received, something that's almost unprecedented for a reunion album. Now, the band is back with {album: The Obliterati}, and Jim and Greg are as impressed as they were twenty years ago. {host: Jim} points to the incredible melodies of the songs, as well as their intellectual wit. He also thinks that {place: Chicago}-based engineer {name: Bob Weston} did an amazing job with {album: The Obliterati}. {host: Greg} agrees that the band's melodies are as strong as ever, and explains that Mission of Burma's greatness lies in the tension between the melodies and the noise. He still can't believe that a band would make two such great albums in the second leg of their career. {album: The Obliterati} gets two {tag: Buy It}s.

## 00:54:49 DIJ: Jim
{artist: The Jayhawks} were brought up briefly during the {artist: Dixie Chicks} review, and Jim's {tag: Desert Island Jukebox} pick also features the {place: Twin Cities} {genre: rock} band. Before they were The Jayhawks, {name: Gary Louris}, {name: Marc Perlman} and {name: Mark Olson} backed up a fellow {place: Minnesota} singer named {artist: Lori Wray}. While Wray has not achieved a lot of success outside of {place: Minneapolis}/{place: St. Paul}, Jim thinks that her voice surpasses that of {name: Natalie Maines}. He explains that she adds a {artist: Lulu}-[like](http://www.lulu.co.uk/) {era: '60s} {genre: pop} sensibility to her singing, making her voice perfect for heartbreak tunes like his DIJ pick, "{track: True Love in a Day}."
