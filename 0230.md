# Show 230: Spring 2010 Review Roundup 
New records are blooming like crazy this spring. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} catch up on new releases from {artist: MGMT}, {artist: LCD Soundsystem}, {artist: Hole} and more. 

![Records](http://static.soundopinions.org/images/2010/vinyl%20records.jpg)

## 00:01:50 News: 4.23.2010
First in the news, the state of {place: Illinois} may impose a {tag: tax} on {tag: digital music} and {tag: film} {tag: downloads} in order to help bail out its $13 billion deficit. If the legislature approves {name: Governor Quinn}'s proposal, Illinois would join 19 other states that currently have such a tax and be able to get $10 million revenues annually. Per usual, this has prompted partisan debate, but {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} doubt either party is much concerned with the music fan's perspective.

One of rock's biggest stars, {artist: Paul McCartney}, is going indie. The former Beatle has announced a plan to take his solo catalog from major label {label: EMI} and move it to the independent {label: Concord} label. McCartney previously worked with Concord as part of his now defunct {tag: Starbucks Hear Music} deal. EMI is one of 4 big music companies dominating the industry these days, and as Jim and Greg explain, these labels depend on back catalog revenue. It takes little overhead to repackage an album from an artist like McCartney, and they can reissue it over and over again to new consumers.

Jim and Greg next discuss rapper {artist: Guru} who {tag: died} last week. The {genre: hip hop} artist moved to {place: New York City} just in time for the genre's golden age. He developed alongside {artist: Public Enemy}, {artist: Run DMC} and {artist: Tribe Called Quest}, to name a few. Guru joined up with {artist: DJ Premier} to form {artist: Gang Starr}, a duo with a revolutionary sound fusing {genre: rap} with {genre: jazz}. This, along with his fluid vocal style, made Gang Starr one of hip hop's most influential acts. To honor the late artist, Jim and Greg play "{track: Jazz Thing}," a track from the {album: Mo' Better Blues soundtrack} featuring jazz musician {artist: Branford Marsalis}.

## 00:11:07 Review: LCD Soundsystem
![This Is Happening (Deluxe Edition)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7e/Lcdthisishappening.jpg/220px-Lcdthisishappening.jpg "29525428/709413684")
During the next segment {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} review this season's big new releases. First up, {album: This Is Happening} by {artist: LCD Soundsystem}. LCD Soundsystem began as a pet project for DFA co-founder {name: James Murphy}. He's been instrumental in establishing the dance-punk sound of the past decade. Jim thinks Murphy is going for a Roxy Music vocal style. He explains that Murphy is saying this record will be his last, but notes that it's not his best. Greg agrees, adding that the bar was set very high with the previous two releases. There was much more honest emotion. But that said, it's still worth your money: a double {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:21:45 Review: Roky Erickson
![True Love Cast Out All Evil (with Okkervil River)](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/8b/f9/27/8bf927e6-19c2-7cc1-8764-e46d50571bef/source/600x600bb.jpg "6833539/366320221")
{genre: Psychedelic rock} pioneer {artist: Roky Erickson} has an album out called {album: True Love Cast Out All Evil}. Since fronting the {artist: 13th Floor Elevators}, Erickson has been in heavy decline, dealing with mental illness and drug abuse. He was nursed back to health by his brother and, in part, the {place: Austin} community. So this record, which was {tag: produced} by {name: Will Scheff} of {artist: Okkervill River}, is a personal as well as a professional achievement. {host: Greg} describes this record as reflective rather than howling. But, it's beautiful to hear his voice, which is still intact. He gives it a {tag: Buy It}. {host: Jim} wishes that Erickson had collaborated with someone like {name: Billy Gibbons}, who could've brought out the acid rock side of the singer. He doesn't recommend this if it's your first foray into Erickson's music, but gives it a Buy It.

## 00:29:03 Review: High on Fire
![Snakes for the Divine (Bonus Track Edition)](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/72/1e/fc/721efc2a-f23f-bda2-6fa5-47562e60a63f/source/600x600bb.jpg "19111598/353008232")
{genre: Heavy metal} group {artist: High on Fire} also has a new album out called {album: Snakes for the Divine}. The band's {tag: guitarist}, {name: Matt Pike}, began as a member of the legendary {genre: stoner rock} group {artist: Sleep}. As {host: Greg} explains, you can hear their influence on Pike's playing today, which sounds like three guitars rolled into one. And, he'd rank Snakes for the Divine as one of High on Fire's best. {host: Jim} admits there's some silliness with regards to the lyrics, but also calls Pike one of the most inventive guitarists in the last two decades. It's a pummeling record that gets a double {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:34:42 Review: MGMT
![Congratulations (Remixes) - EP](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/MGMT_Congratulations.jpg "251553551/423309035")
After gaining attention with their 2007 debut {album: Oracular Spectacular}, {place: Brooklyn} duo {artist: MGMT} are back with {album: Congratulations}. They've expanded their {genre: synth pop} sound and have looked to {host: Jim}'s hero {artist: Brian Eno} for inspiration. So, he wonders why he doesn't like their music more. He finds their vocal style irritating and the subject matter flimsy and can only give Congratulations a {tag: Burn It}. {host: Greg} is impressed with what {tag: producer} {name: Pete Kember} of {artist: Spaceman 3} has brought to the table, as well as their darker lyrics and gives the album a {tag: Buy It} rating.

## 00:43:55 Review: Hole
![Nobody's Daughter (Bonus Track Version)](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/13/31/a9/1331a9af-791b-f1ba-7063-ab962b74b452/source/600x600bb.jpg "115269/368317227")
The final review is of {album: Nobody's Daughter}, the reunion effort from {name: Courtney Love} and {artist: Hole}. Love is one of rock's most famous widows...and also train wrecks. So, it was a surprise to {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} that she paired up with slick Hollywood {tag: songwriter} {artist: Linda Perry}. The last thing they want to hear is a professional Courtney Love, except maybe an immature, ranting Courtney Love. Both are on Nobody's Daughter in full effect, and it's a {tag: Trash It}.

## 00:50:45 DIJ: Jim
{host: Jim} has spent the last week looking at images of the volcanic eruption in {place: Iceland} and thinking about a way to honor the European nation. Arguably its biggest musical export is {artist: Björk}. Jim hasn't loved her sparse, robotic sound in recent years, but will always remember songs like "{track: It's Oh So Quiet}" fondly. So, he adds his favorite Björk track to the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}.
