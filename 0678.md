{artist : Van Morrison}'s 1968 album {album : Astral Weeks} didn't produce huge hits, but as {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} explain, this record is unique from any other in Van Morrison's collection, and in fact, in rock history.  Astral Weeks melds {genre : rock}, {genre : blues}, {genre : folk} and {genre : jazz} in such a way that makes it hard to define. For the recording sessions, Morrison was backed by a jazz trio made up of guitarist {artist : Jay Berliner}, drummer {artist : Connie Kay} and bassist {artist : Richard Davis}. And while the music sets the mood, Jim and Greg both marvel at the emotions conveyed by the song writing on Astral Weeks. You hear Van Morrison struggle with the search for home and the impermanence of life. It's as much a poem as it is an album, making it a classic in the Sound Opinions' book. So, as the album turns 50, Jim and Greg conduct a Sound Opinions {tag : Classic Album Dissection}.
