# Show 540: Eleventh Dream Day & Opinions on M83

![Eleventh Dream Day](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2016/eleventhdreamday_web.jpg)

While never achieving the commercial success of its {genre: alt-rock} peers like {artist: Nirvana} and {artist: Smashing Pumpkins}, {artist: Eleventh Dream Day} has outlasted these bands and remain critical darlings. They join {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} for a conversation and live performance. Plus, a review of the new album from {place: French} {genre: electronic} band {artist: M83}.


## 00:02:31 Intro: Music News

Five years ago {artist: LCD Soundsystem} announced its retirement. Boy has time flown, because they are back. James Murphy and his bandmates will be reuniting this summer for a series of performances at festivals like {tag: Coachella}, {tag: Bonnaroo} and {tag: Lollapalooza}. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} lament that the schedules for the season's major festivals are virtually the same. Music critics from the {tag: *New York Times*} agree and won't be covering any of the big three, instead focusing on boutique festivals and summer concerts. As they write, these destination festivals are more about fun in the sun than music.

After one year in business, {artist: Jay Z}'s {tag: streaming} service {tag: TIDAL} has numbers to report. According to the service, they have 3 million subscribers total and {artist: Kanye West}'s new album {album: The Life of Pablo} has been streamed roughly 250 million times. Jim, Greg and other industry-watchers are skeptical about this figure. But, however the accounting shakes out, TIDAL is small potatoes compared to the leader {tag: Spotify} with 30 million subscribers and {tag: Apple Music} with 11 million.

## 00:06:59 Interview: Eleventh Dream Day
![Eleventh Dream Day](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/540/BN0.jpg)
{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} harken back to the {genre: alternative} era this week as they sit down with {artist: Eleventh Dream Day}. The band formed in 1983 and got its start as part of the {place: Chicago} underground scene alongside peers {artist: Hüsker Dü} in St. Paul and {artist: Nirvana} in Seattle. Greg remembers watching Eleventh Dream Day perform at that time, and knew they were destined for big things. But, while albums like {album: Prairie School Freakout} garnered high critical praise and caught the attention of {label: Atlantic Records}, they were never able to achieve major commercial success. As Jim notes, however, they are having the last laugh with their impressive longevity, especially considering founding members {name: Rick Rizzo} and {name: Janet Beveridge Bean} got married, had a child and got divorced, all while maintaining the group. In January Eleventh Dream Day released its eleventh studio album {album: Works for Tomorrow}, and they show no signs of slowing, as is clear in this ferocious live performance in the Sound Opinions studio.  

## 00:48:07 Review: M83
![Junk](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/540/2870.jpg)
{place: French} {genre: electronic} band {artist: M83} began as a bedroom project in {era: 2001}, but its recordings have become increasingly elaborate and lush. Now based in {place: Los Angeles}, the band reached a commercial and critical peak with its 2011 album {album: Hurry Up, We're Dreaming} and has returned with its seventh album, {album: Junk}. While previous records were unified concept albums, {album: Junk} is frustratingly all over the map, according to {host: Jim}. In interviews, leader {name: Anthony Gonzalez} claims to have been inspired by {era: 1970s} and '{era: 80s} {tag: sitcoms} like *Who's the Boss?* and *Punky Brewster*. The result, Jim says, is a few brilliant {genre: dance-pop} moments, but also plenty of dreck, earning it a {tag: Try It}. {host: Greg} misses the emotional connection that M83 built on {album: Hurry Up, We're Dreaming}. He finds {album: Junk} in contrast to be cheesy and intentionally slight, with often chintzy-sounding orchestration. But Greg hears just enough worthwhile tracks to salvage {album: Junk} as a Try It.
