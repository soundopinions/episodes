# Show 548: Bob Dylan at 75 â€“ From Protest to Plugging In

![Early Bob Dylan](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2016/bobdylanfolkie_web.jpg)

{artist: Bob Dylan}, one of the most iconic American artists of the 20th century, just turned 75 this May. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} examine the extraordinary career of the music legend in the first of a two-part series. This week, they explore Dylan's {genre: folk} days to the moment he went electric.


## 00:02:33 Intro: Music News

{artist: Adele} continues down her path of superstardom by scoring the biggest recording deal in the history of music. After three albums on the British indie label {label: XL}, Adele has signed a deal with {tag: Sony} for around $132 million. She will be on the conglomerate's subsidiary label, {label: Columbia}, alongside artists like {artist: Barbra Streisand}, {artist: Bob Dylan} and {artist: John Mayer}. In the mid {era: '90s} and early {era: 2000s}, musicians like {artist: Prince}, {artist: R.E.M.} and {artist: U2} were signing massive recording deals. However in 2016, substantial contracts are much harder to come by due to the large decrease in album sales. Adele seems to be the exception to the rule, which is reflected in her new, record-breaking contract.


## 00:04:25 Special: Bob Dylan at 75: Folk Days to Newport

{tag: *Don't Look Back*}, the classic {artist: Bob Dylan} documentary instructs us. But as the American music icon just turned 75 on May 24th, Jim and Greg can't help saying happy birthday by revisiting our multi-part special on his life and career. In our first installment, we focus on Dylan's {tag: early years} as a {genre:  folk}ie and {tag: protest singer} in {place: New York}. Dylan moved from Minnesota to {place: Greenwich Village} in {era: 1961} at age 19. Within just a few years, he was signed to {label: Columbia Records}, teamed up with {tag: manager} {name: Albert Grossman}, released four albums, and become "the voice of a generation." {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} spoke to Dylan {tag: expert} {name: Clinton Heylin} in 2009 about the singer's influences during those years and his growth as a songwriter and performer. Clinton explored Dylan's entire song catalog in two companion books, {tag: *Revolution in the Air*} and {tag: *Still on the Road*}. 

Never one to be pigeonholed, Dylan abandoned categories just as soon as he was assigned them. At his headlining set at the {tag: Newport Folk Festival} in {place: Rhode Island} on July 25, 1965, Dylan went electric by playing with a full rock band. Jim and Greg get a first-hand account of the infamous concert from musician, songwriter and A&R man {name: Al Kooper}. Al performed with Dylan onstage at Newport, and he dispels a half-century's worth of myths about the "boos" that allegedly came from the crowd.

Next week, we conclude our Dylan celebration with a look at {album: Blonde on Blonde} and Dylan's "Modern Times."
