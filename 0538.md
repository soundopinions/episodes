# Show 538: 1991 Revisited & Opinions on Iggy Pop
![1991](http://static.soundopinions.org/images/2011/1991.jpg)

{tag: 1991} was the year {genre: punk} broke again! Twenty five years later, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} explore what made 1991 so special: {artist: Nirvana}, {artist: N.W.A.}, {tag: Lollapalooza} and more. Plus a review of the new collaboration between punk veteran {artist: Iggy Pop} and {artist: Josh Homme} of {artist: Queens of the Stone Age}.


## 00:01:45 Special: Revisiting 1991
![1991](http://static.soundopinions.org/images/2016/1991albums.jpg)

Though it seems like just yesterday for many, it's been 25 years since {era: 1991}. Along with {era: 1964}, {era: '67} and {era: '76}, 1991 was a landmark year for music. You can hear its influence everywhere from neo-{genre: grunge} band {artist: Bully} to {place: Compton} rapper {artist: Kendrick Lamar}. While {artist: Bryan Adams} and {artist: Garth Brooks} topped the charts, there are even more musicians that made groundbreaking strides back in '91. For Jim and Greg, 1991 was all about:

- {artist: Nirvana} and the birth of grunge
- {artist: My Bloody Valentine} and the growth of {genre: shoegaze}
- {tag: Lollapalooza} and the rise of the {tag: Alternative Nation}
- {artist: N.W.A.} and the reign of {genre: gangsta rap}
- {artist: Massive Attack} and the birth of {genre: trip-hop}


## 00:42:28 Review: Iggy Pop
![Post Pop Depression](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music49/v4/f8/b7/23/f8b7238d-0f43-6c4c-ce10-1544fb00021a/source/600x600bb.jpg "13622/1074544499")

The "godfather of {genre: punk}" has released his 17th–and maybe final– album, {album: Post Pop Depression}. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} are both huge {artist: Iggy Pop} fans, but Jim thinks outside of a few moments of brilliance with tracks like {track: Lust for Life}, {track: The Passenger}, and {track: Candy}, his solo career is a disaster. Jim's opinion is that while Iggy's first three albums with {artist: The Stooges} were perfect, the punk legend has never had much to say lyrically. Even {name: Josh Homme}'s attempts to fire up the album don't work, and Jim's got to call this record a {tag: Trash It}. Greg couldn't disagree more. He'll concede that Iggy's {era: 80s} output was less than stellar, but some of his solo records in the {era: 90s} and beyond have had great moments. *Post Pop Depression* is his best work since *The Idiot* and {album: Lust for Life}. Homme understands Iggy and provides a setting for him to do what he does best. Greg describes the lyrics as poetic and at different times dark, meditative, funny, and rageful. The record also shows off Iggy's underrated singing. Greg says {tag: Buy It}. If this truly is Iggy's last album, what a way to go out. 

## 00:50:27 DIJ: Jim

This week, Jim and Greg are soaking up some sun and new music in the beautiful city of {place: Austin, Texas} for {tag: South by Southwest}. While {host: Jim} always loves visiting the annual festival to discover new talent, there's one element that makes him positively giddy – world famous {place: Texas} BBQ food. So for this trip to the desert island, Jim thought he would mentally prepare himself for some good old-fashioned carnivorous cuisine with the {artist: Reverend Horton Heat} song, "{track: Eat Steak}." This track is some fun {genre: psychobilly rock} that will get you looking for the closest barbeque restaurant, and fast.
