{artist : Robyn Hitchcock}'s new album {album : Shufflemania} is at least his 22nd album since 1981. As longtime fans, Jim and Greg are both happy Hitchcock is back with his first new work in five years. They both agree it is among his best albums.



## 00:07:33 Review: Plains

![Plains I Walked with You a Ways](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/888/CL1.jpg)

{artist : Plains} is a new group made up of {tag : Katie Crutchfield} of {artist : Waxahatchee} and {artist : Jess Williamson}. The two songwriters share a family history with country music and their album {album : I Walked With You A Ways} is a celebration of the genre. Greg enjoys hearing this side of the artists, but Jim finds it a bit of a place-holder album.



## 00:14:52 Interview: Margo Price

{artist : Margo Price} made a big splash with her 2016 album, Midwest Farmer's Daughter on Jack White's Third Man Records. But, as she details in her first book Maybe We'll Make It, she was anything but an overnight success. Jim and Greg welcome Price back to the show with a wide-ranging interview that covers questions of what might have been and desperate schemes Price cooked up to get around music industry gate-keepers.
