Jim and Greg explore the growing genre of {genre: Electronic Dance Music} and the new rave generation with writer {name: Philip Sherburne}.

## 00:01:46 Intro: Music News
Last week {artist: Justin Bieber}'s fans sold out his entire {tag: North American tour} in under an hour (that's an average of 1,000 tix a second). Beliebers indeed. If you're asking how this is even possible, you aren't alone. {tag: NPR} talked to concert industry expert {name: Gary Bongiovanni}, who said, as Jim puts it, "the game is rigged." Once the scalpers, fans clubs, credit card companies and radio stations have gotten their cut of the tickets (whether through pre-sale or, in the case of scalpers, by using bot programs to "cut the line"), less than half of the stated number of tickets actually go on sale to the public. If you're wondering why you can't get tickets to your favorite act, this is why.

## 00:04:51 Genre Dissection: Electronic Dance Music
{name: Robert F.X. Sillerman}'s favorite artists are {artist: Bob Dylan} and {artist: Paul Simon}, but lately the entertainment mogul's been in a dancing mood. The man who helped create {tag: Clear Channel} by buying up radio stations and concert venues is investing in {genre: electronic dance music} in a big way. Starting with {place: Louisiana}'s {label: Disco Productions}, Sillerman has started buying up regional dance music promoters, with the intention, Jim supposes, of selling the genre's collective neon-tinted audience to advertisers. He says it's just the latest example of the corporatization of this booming corner of the music industry. Speaking of which...

## 00:06:54 Interview: Philip Sherburne
{genre: EDM} - or Electronic Dance Music - has exploded over the past decade in {place: Europe} and the {place: United States}. But if names like {artist: Skrillex}, {artist: Tiesto}, {artist: Deadmau5}, and {artist: David Guetta} mean nothing to you, never fear. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} have brought in {tag: Spin}'s {name: Philip Sherburne}, author of the "Control Voltage" blog, to offer a primer for the un-initiated. They kick off the conversation with a discussion of the genre's recent evolution: from the short-lived nineties rave scene with its anonymous DJs spinning in dark rooms, to the audio/visual spectacles presided over by celebrity DJs that we see today. A new emphasis on showmanship, and the adoption of dub step's aggressive, bass-heavy beats have won superstar producers like Skrillex, Tiesto, and {artist: Rusko} a huge, youthful following says Sherburne, effectively making EDM the new stadium rock. But he'd also suggest keeping your eye on the up-and-comers, artists like {artist: SBTRKT}, {artist: Four Tet}, and {artist: Caribou}.

Wrapping things up, Jim and Greg put the new artists we've heard in historical context. After all, as Jim says, covering dance music can give you deja vu. Greg reminds us that todays EDM producers are following in the footsteps of {genre: disco} artists like {artist: Giorgio Moroder}, {place: Chicago} {genre: house} and {genre: techno} musicians, {artist: Kraftwerk}, {artist: Aphex Twin}, {artist: Fatboy Slim}, and - dare we say it - {artist: Brian Eno}.

## 00:48:43 Review: Garbage
![Not Your Kind of People (Deluxe)](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/341/2970.jpg)

It's been awhile since we heard from {artist: Garbage} - seven years in fact. Now the alt-rockers are back with a new studio album, {album: Not Your Kind of People}. At this point, {host: Jim} points out, Garbage is a nostalgia act. They first made a splash in the mid-nineties, convincing grunge kids to don {genre: Goth} makeup and get out on the dance floor with singles like "{track: Stupid Girl}," and "{track: Only Happy When It Rains}." Some might say Garbage was also a cash-in project, with lead singer {name: Shirley Manson} and alt-era {tag: producer}s {name: Butch Vig}, {name: Duke Erikson}, and {name: Steve Marker} content to ride the grunge wave. But even {host: Jim} admits, you couldn't help tapping your foot to those singles. What has Garbage got for us in 2012? According to {host: Greg}, {album: Not Your Kind of People} offers singles just as good as any Garbage recorded back in the day. But after a seven-year hiatus, that's not enough. He never was much of a fan of Garbage albums, and that, along with the band's sound, hasn't changed. {host: Jim} agrees. {name: Shirley Manson} is still a compelling front woman, and who couldn't use a little goth dance music in their life? But ultimately, this is a {tag: Burn it} album.
