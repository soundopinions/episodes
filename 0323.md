## 00:01:30 Intro: Music News
{tag: *Soul Train*} host and creator {name: Don Cornelius} died tragically this week at age 75. Greg remembers the baritone-voiced {place: Chicago} native as not just a music {tag: pioneer}, but a {tag: civil rights} one. He broadened what we think of as "soul" and brought acts like {artist: Curtis Mayfield}, {artist: David Bowie} and {artist: Aretha Franklin} to audiences of all races and ages. What {tag: *American Bandstand*} was to pop culture in the '{era: 60s}, *Soul Train* and Cornelius were to the '{era: 70s}, '{era: 80s}, and beyond. So to remember Don Cornelius, we play {artist: Barry White}'s 1975 orchestral performance of "{track: You're My First, the Last, My Everything}." 

## 00:08:29 Special: 1967
Not to make you feel old, but it's been 45 years since the "{tag: Summer of Love}," the year of the hippie, and some of the most influential music in rock history. So Jim and Greg have decided to look back at the watershed year {tag: 1967}. {tag: Television} viewers were treated to memorable {tag: performances} by {artist: The Who}, {artist: The Doors} and {artist: The Rolling Stones}. {artist: Aretha Franklin} recorded her famous {label: Atlantic} release "{track: Respect}." Fans from around the country gathered in California for the {tag: Monterey International Pop Music Festival}. But during this episode Jim and Greg focus on the single LP's that changed the way people thought of the studio and a collection of songs. {era: 1967} gave birth to the idea of album as art.

00:21:15 {album: Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club} band is, of course, the most prominent example of studio innovation on album in '67. Recorded at {tag: Abbey Road} by {name: George Martin} on mono, stereo and four-track recorders, Sgt. Pepper's was a critical and commercial success. But, as they stated during our {album: Revolver} {tag: Classic Album Dissection}, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} don't think it's {artist: The Beatles}' best. Nor is it the best album of that year. They'd point people to the landmark recordings {album: The Piper at the Gates of Dawn} by {artist: Pink Floyd}, {album: Forever Changes} by {artist: Love} and {album: The Velvet Underground and Nico} by {artist: The Velvet Underground}. Jim and Greg talk about these albums' innovations in terms of recording and artistic ambition.
