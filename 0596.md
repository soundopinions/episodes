# Show 596: Guitar Riffs & Opinions on The Obsessed

![Guitar Riffs](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2017/guitarriff_web.jpg)

Perhaps the most essential element of rock 'n' roll is a great {tag : guitar riff}. {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} share some of their favorite guitar licks of all time. Plus, they review the latest from long-running {genre : metal} band {artist : The Obsessed} and pay tribute to the late director {name : Jonathan Demme}.



## 00:01:45 List: Guitar Riffs

Does anything define rock and roll more than its basic element, the {tag : guitar riff}? Rock solos can be overblown and overrated, but a riff, when done right, can rule a song. In many ways, it's the essence of {genre : rock 'n' roll}. {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} run through their favorite examples of {tag : guitar} riffs in rock history, and they hear some picks from listeners across the country. But first, a definition. A {tag : riff} is a brief statement – sometime only a handful of notes or chords – that recurs throughout the arrangement and can become the song's central hook. And for a {tag : guitarist} like {name : Nile Rodgers}, it's not just a static foundational element, but like a river moving through the song. Now onto the goods.

## 00:43:36 Review: The Obsessed

![Sacred](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/596/20O0.jpg)

Although {artist : The Obsessed} was formed by {name : Scott "Wino" Weinrich} back in 1976, the {place : Maryland}  {genre : metal} band has only released four albums in its career. The latest, {album : Sacred}, is its first in 23 years and continues the band's blend of {genre : stoner rock}, {genre : doom metal}, and {genre : biker rock}. According to {host : Greg}, Wino is not revisiting his old glories but is instead writing contemplatively about his life as an outsider in very honest terms. Although the production is cleaner than on previous records, that serves to underline the band's great melodies. {host : Jim} says that the great thing about metal is that it doesn't matter what you look like or how old you are, as long as you can deliver the goods – and Wino can do just that. The songs on {album : Sacred} are as good as any in the band's past, with more bottom than ever in the sound. The album earns a double-{tag : Buy It}.



## 00:51:08 Obit: Jonathan Demme
