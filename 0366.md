## 00:01:45 News: 11.30.2012
Anyone who has ever taught his or her parent to use an {tag: iPhone} knows that the older generation doesn't always mix well with the digital age. But don't tell that to the {artist: Rolling Stones}. The veteran rockers are celebrating their 50 years in the business by releasing an {tag: app}. As Mick explains, the Stones wanted to something "special and innovative." And of course, they wanna sell stuff. Also coming around to this new fangled digital world is {artist: AC/DC}. The longstanding {tag: Apple} holdouts will finally make their catalog available on {tag: iTunes}. That just leaves a short list of withholders including {artist: Black Sabbath} and {artist: Garth Brooks}.

{artist: Rihanna} hit #1 this week for the first time. Jim and Greg review the new album later in the show, but are interested in the fact that Ri-Ri joined a long list of prominent artists in an {tag: open letter} to {tag: Congress} opposing the {tag: Internet Radio Fairness Act}. Apparently, she doesn't credit streaming services like {tag: Pandora} with her success. Members of {artist: Maroon 5}, {artist: Pink Floyd} and {artist: Katy Perry} join Rihanna in saying, we dig you Pandora, but don't gut our royalties. Check out {host: Greg}'s coverage of the debate from the recent {place: Future of Music Summit}.

## 00:06:59 Interview: Divine Fits
Well they are "super" and they are a "group," but don't let the categorization make you think any less of the new duo {artist: Divine Fits}. It combines the talents of {name: Britt Daniel} of {artist: Spoon} {name: Dan Boeckner} of {artist: Handsome Furs} and {artist: Wolf Parade}, and {name: Sam Brown} of {artist: New Bomb Turks}, along with {tag: keyboardist} {name: Alex Fischel}. Britt and "serial-collaborator" Dan (both veterans of the Sound Opinions studio) share the singing and songwriting duties, and the musical relationship began with just a simple phone call...not an email! The result is the aptly named {album: A Thing Called Divine Fits}. Dan credits {artist: Sister Nancy} as inspiration for the title. Check out video of their live performance.

## 00:44:36 Review: Rihanna
![Unapologetic](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/61/70/55/617055b5-3d2b-4ed3-dd0a-cf262bd5bf43/source/600x600bb.jpg "63346553/1168096518")


Reigning {genre: pop}/{genre: R&B} queen and hook-singer du jour {artist: Rihanna} is back with a new release called {album: Unapologetic} - her first to top the {tag: Billboard} albums chart. The 24-year-old Barbadian singer has been all over the news in recent weeks, though not necessarily for her music. By dueting with the man who assaulted her in 2009 (fellow R&B singer {artist: Chris Brown}) on "Nobody's Business," Rihanna ensured her seventh studio album would be everybody's business. So how's the music? {host: Jim} calls the upbeat {genre: dance-pop} fare on the first half of the record "pure pop pleasure." But when things get sappier and slowed-down on side two, her limits as a {tag: vocalist} become clear. {host: Greg} agrees with Jim that Rihanna's {name: Chris Brown} collab is pure "button-pushing." He points to her 2009 album {album: Rated R} as a more ambitious and successful exploration of that troubled relationship. While he appreciates that the singer is moving in a more serious direction, he laments that the pop hooks just aren't there. Unapologetic gets a double {tag: Try It}.

## 00:50:58 DIJ: Jim
Jim's {tag: DIJ} pick was inspired by an article he read recently in {tag: The New Yorker}. In spite of a life-long hatred of {artist: The Grateful Dead}, Jim made it through (and even enjoyed!) {name: Nick Paumgarten}'s 25,000 words on the world of Deadhead bootleg tape collecting. No, this critic wasn't converted to the church of {name: Jerry Garcia}, but the article did remind him of some particular nasty punk songs with lyrics about the Dead. His favorite, "{track: Pop Songs}" by {artist: Suicidal Tendencies}, is this week's addition to the jukebox.
