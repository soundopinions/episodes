# Show 523: Sam Phillips & Sun Studios and Opinions on Adele

![Sam Phillips](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2015/samphillips_web.jpg)

From his studio in {place: Memphis}, {label: Sun Records} founder {name: Sam Phillips} was the first to record Elvis Presley, {artist: Howlin' Wolf}, {name: Jerry Lee Lewis}, and more.  Music writer {name: Peter Guralnick} joins host {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} for a discussion about the pioneering {genre: rock 'n' roll} producer. Then Jim and Greg review the new record-setting album from {place: British} singer {artist: Adele}.


## 00:02:07 Intro: Music News
"All the squares, go home!" {name: Cynthia Robinson}, famed trumpeter for {artist: Sly and the Family Stone}, has passed away at the age of 71 from cancer. Robinson, [a former guest on *Sound Opinions*](/show/431/), moved from flute to clarinet before ultimately becoming one of the great {tag: trumpet} players in rock. She was childhood friends with {name: Sly Stone} and co-founded {artist: Sly and the Stoners} with him in the {era: mid-'60s}. That band would become Sly and the Family Stone, scoring huge hits like "{track: Dance to the Music}," "{track: Everyday People}," and "{track: Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)}". According to {host: Greg}, not only was the band groundbreaking musically in its mix of {genre: rock}, {genre: funk}, and {genre: soul}, but he also credits its biracial co-ed makeup for embodying the counterculture better than any other band. As tribute to the great Cynthia Robinson, they play "{track: Underdog}," an early horn feature from 1967.


## 00:06:12 Interview: Peter Guralnick on Sam Phillips & Sun Studios
![Samphillipsbook](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/523/AC0.jpg)
{name: Peter Guralnick} has written extensively about {place: America}n music for decades including a two-part biography on {artist: Elvis Presley}, the biography *Searching for {artist: Robert Johnson}* and an acclaimed trilogy on American {genre: roots} music. Now he's back with a comprehensive look at {name: Sam Phillips} called *The Man Who Invented {genre: Rock 'n' Roll}: How One Man Discoverd {artist: Howlin' Wolf}, {artist: Ike Turner}, {artist: Jerry Lee Lewis}, {artist: Johnny Cash} and {artist: Elvis Presley} and How His Tiny Label {label: Sun Records} of {place: Memphis}, Revolutionized the World.* If {name: Sam Phillips}, {place: Sun Studios} or {label: Sun Records} are new names to you, Peter wants to take you back to 1950s and 60s for what many historians call the birth of rock 'n' roll. Sun was home to black and white artists of the era who were merging genres like country, gospel, and R&B in ways unthinkable at the time. And that kind of freedom of spirit and enthusiasm, in addition to the idea that everybody has a song to sing, were the tenants of the Sun sound, even more than sonic hallmarks like "{tag: slapback echo}."


## 00:48:28 Review: Adele
![25](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/523/28S0.jpg)
{genre: Pop} powerhouse {artist: Adele} recently made her highly anticipated return to music with her third album {album: 25}. In typical Adele fashion, she ended up selling almost 3.4 million copies of *25* in one week, breaking a previous record held by {artist: NSYNC}'s {era: 2000} album {album: No Strings Attached}. Something else noteworthy about this new record is that is was produced by the biggest names in music, with songs by {name: Ryan Tedder}, {name: Max Martin}, {name: Greg Kurstin} and {artist: Bruno Mars}. {host: Greg} has to admit that he is disappointed with the album. While he enjoyed songs like "{track: Million Years}" and "{track: Miss You}," he thought Adele could have challenged herself more. Greg isn't hearing any new terrain being mined, and even though Adele has moved on in real life from that infamous relationship, musically she's still "living in {album: 21} land." He gives *25* a {tag: Try It}. {host: Jim} is far more incensed because he was a big fan of Adele's first album, {album: 19}. The lyrics are beneath her. And without more interesting, unique songs, he has to say {tag: Trash It}.
