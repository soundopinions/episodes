## 00:02:23 News: 08.12.06
The {tag: RAND Corporation} recently released the findings of their study on music lyrics and teen sexual behavior. According to the think tank, teens who regularly listened to music with "degrading" lyrics at the start of the study were more likely to start having sex over the next two years than teens who listened to music that was sexual, but not necessarily degrading. Of course, degrading is in the eye of the beholder, and Jim and Greg are a little bit suspicious of the RAND Corp.'s goals. They are reminded of previous attempts to thwart dangerous {genre: rock} music, like those of the {tag: Parents' Music Resource Center} in the {era: '80s} and people concerned with future {tag: Columbine}s in the {era: '90s}. So Jim, Greg and many experts caution against scapegoating one single thing when it comes to teens having sex. Plus, rock and roll has always been about sex, and after speaking with a number of teenagers in downtown {place: Chicago}, Sound Opinions is convinced that tastes have not really changed. Most of these young listeners seemed to be channeling {name: Dick Clark}: They just want a great beat they can dance to. 

## 00:10:58 Review: Rick Ross
![Port of Miami](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/e5/b2/2e/e5b22e40-3d30-8414-d108-4c9c570676fa/source/600x600bb.jpg "4022281/171755499")
Also making news this month is {place: Miami} rapper {artist: Rick Ross}. Ross' single "{track: Hustlin}" has become the most downloaded ringtone of all time, and his new album {album: Port of Miami}, is proving to be one of the big {genre: hip-hop} hits of the summer. Despite what the study above might have you believe, it is the "drugs" of "sex, drugs and rock and roll" that appear to be prevailing. {genre: Trap} music is dominating the hip-hop charts, and the [lyrics](http://rapgenius.com/Rick-ross-hustlin-lyrics) to "{track: Hustlin}," "{track: Blow}" and almost every other song on {album: Port of Miami} are about the joys of selling cocaine. Listening to the record was not such a joy for our hosts, however. While people like {artist: Ice-T }and {artist: Ghostface Killah} have artfully written [songs](http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ghostfacekillah/kilo.html) about the drug economy, Ross is not impressing {host: Jim} or Greg with anything new. {host: Greg} appreciates the bass-heavy production, but recommends listeners hear the music in a club setting, rather than in the confines of their own homes. this debut album gets a double {tag: Trash It}.

## 00:21:46 Interview: Jason Lytle
{name: Jason Lytle}, the man behind {artist: Grandaddy}, joins {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} in the studio this week. Grandaddy has impressed our hosts for years with its {genre: folk-pop} melodies and adventurous, atmospheric production. The band's recent release, {album: Just Like the Fambly Cat}, however, was their last. Lytle discusses his decision to disband with Jim and Greg, explaining that the music industry and life on the road became too demanding. With the exception of a tour Grandaddy did with {artist: Elliott Smith}, Lytle was unhappy with how larger corporate tours were structured. For this current acoustic tour, Lytle wanted to return to a simple road trip among friends.

Fans of Grandaddy need not mourn the loss of Lytle's songwriting and production, however. He has relocated to {place: Montana}, but promises that more music is still to come. Listen to the two songs he performs, "{track: Disconnecty}" and "{track: Jeez Louise}," the latter of which is semi-autobiographical. In addition, Lytle treats us to a {artist: Sheryl Crow} cover, "{track: Always on Your Side}" -- a surprising choice for sure. Next time perhaps he'll treat us to a song by {artist: Electric Light Orchestra}, another secret favorite of our guest.

## 00:45:34 Review: Tapes 'n Tapes
![The Loon](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/bb/f3/93/bbf39349-cd8f-d438-2696-289efaa192a8/source/600x600bb.jpg "129692168/160561715")
Minneapolis band {artist: Tapes 'n Tapes} released their debut album, {album: The Loon}, this week. The {genre: indie rock} band has been getting a lot of buzz, especially after being added to this year's {tag: Pitchfork Music Festival} bill. As Jim recounts, members of the band were merely members of the crowd for last year's festival. {album: The Loon}, which we learn is the state bird of Minnesota, actually came out independently in 2005, but is now being released by {label: XL Records}, a label that's quickly becoming a force in the music industry. {host: Greg} was skeptical that the young band would be able to say anything new with the standard guitar, bass, drums combo. And he was right -- they aren't saying any thing new, but he likes the way they are saying it. He praises the band for being accomplished musicians and credits the personality of lead singer/guitarist {name: Josh Grier} for the band's edge and energy. {host: Jim} finds Tapes 'n Tapes slightly more compelling live, but both hosts give this record a {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:52:19 DIJ: Jim & Greg
Last week, {name: Arthur Lee}, the singer and guitarist for the {genre: psychedelic rock} band {artist: Love}, died of {tag: leukemia} at the age of 61. Jim and Greg explain how Lee was one of the most important figures of the psychedelic era. He influenced bands like {artist: The Doors}, {artist: The Byrds}, and even the other great African-American psychedelic rocker of the day: {artist: Jimi Hendrix}. His masterpiece, {album: Forever Changes}, also influenced contemporary "{genre: orchestral pop}" artists like {artist: The Arcade Fire} and {artist: The Polyphonic Spree}. Lee was a pioneer, but a largely unheralded one. This may have been the musician's own doing, since he was a rather dark, eccentric figure. But, while Lee certainly had many troubled years, Jim and Greg believe his music deserves to be celebrated. To pay tribune to Arthur Lee, our hosts highlight a [song](http://www.seeklyrics.com/lyrics/Love/The-Red-Telephone.html) off of {album: Forever Changes}. They both add "{track: The Red Telephone}" to the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}.
