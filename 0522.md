# Show 522: History of the Moog & Opinions on Kurt Cobain

![The Moog synthesizer](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2015/moog_web.jpg)

The {tag: Moog} {tag: synthesizer} is every bit as important to rock history as the {tag: Fender Telecaster} and the {tag: Gibson Les Paul}. As the {tag: analog synth} revival continues in {genre: pop} music, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} examine the history and legacy of the revolutionary instrument. Then they review the new posthumous release from {artist: Nirvana} frontman {name: Kurt Cobain}.

## 00:02:09 Special: The Moog
The {tag: Moog} company of {place: Asheville}, {place: North Carolina} recently announced it would end production on its flagship synthesizer, the {tag: Minimoog Voyager}. That got Jim and Greg to thinking about the incredible influence the {tag: Moog synthesizer} has had on rock and pop music since it debuted in 1964. {name: Robert Moog}'s invention has seen a renaissance in the past decade, as acts ranging from {artist: M83} to {artist: Future Islands} to {artist: Taylor Swift} have taken inspiration from the synthpop sound.

To get some perspective on the Moog's history and legacy, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} turn to {name: Brian Kehew}, the former official  historian for the {tag: Bob Moog Foundation}. Kehew also co-founded an all-analog band called {artist: Moog Cookbook} in the '90s and has worked in the studio with {artist: Fiona Apple}, {artist: Aimee Mann} and Moog superstars {artist: Emerson, Lake & Palmer}. In addition to ELP, Kehew points to the following as great synthesizer musicians:

### Great Moog-ers
- {artist: Wendy Carlos}
- {artist: Stevie Wonder}
- {artist: Return to Forever}
- {artist: The Monkees}
- {artist: Brian Eno}
- {artist: Kraftwerk}
- {artist: Kinky}
- {artist: Chromeo}

And two of {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}'s favorite {tag: Moog} tracks are "{track: Chameleon}" by {artist: Herbie Hancock} and "{track: Les Yper-Sound}" by {artist: Stereolab}.

## 00:41:56 Review: Kurt Cobain
![Montage of Heck: The Home Recordings (Deluxe Soundtrack)](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music3/v4/ec/e1/fc/ece1fca1-dd46-a9b6-1360-2470fa190ce4/source/600x600bb.jpg "526647/1046058946")

Music fans around the world never thought people they would be able to hear {artist: Kurt Cobain}'s work as a solo artist until now, but it certainly isn't how Cobain intended it. Recently his widow {artist: Courtney Love} and daughter {tag: Francis Bean} authorized a documentary called {tag: *Montage of Heck*}. It focused on his life and featured old home movies, audiotapes and present-day commentary from Kurt's friends and family. The soundtrack album is called {album: Montage of Heck: The Home Recordings}, and many of the tracks are simply Cobain strumming on his guitar or messing around with his tape deck. As a big {artist: Nirvana} fan, {host: Jim} compares the release as was grave robbery. He gives it a massive {tag: Trash It}. {host: Greg} agrees, and notes the whole thing sickens him. The "album" never should've seen the light of day. Cobain sounds stoned, distracted and bored, not at all like how he lit up a stage with Nirvana. Greg says {tag: Trash It}, as well. 


## 00:50:15 DIJ: Jim
This week, {host: Jim} chose the unique track {track: "The Gormleys Will Miss Me"} by the {artist: 27 Various} for two reasons. One explanation is that after his recent DIJ selection by {place: New Jersey}'s {artist: Red Buckets}, it got him thinking more about underground {genre: indie} rock from the {era: 1980s}. The other reason is that ever since Sound Opinions' intern Libby Gormley joined the team, Jim couldn't get this track out of his head. While the {place: Minneapolis} band never gained huge traction, Jim loves this group, and finds this obscure song to be the perfect choice for this week's {tag: Desert Island Jukebox} pick.
