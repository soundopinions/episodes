Every once in a while, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} embark on the {tag: Sound Opinions World Tour} and explore the music of another country. This week felt like a fine time to turn to our neighbor to the north and look at the music coming out of {place: Canada} today. As their guide, they're joined by music critic [{name: Ben Rayner}](https://www.thestar.com/authors.rayner_ben.html) of the the {tag: Toronto Star}. Ben takes them from {place: Montreal}'s {genre: experimental}/{genre: electronic} scene to the {genre: noise-pop} of {place: Halifax} to the country's growing {genre: hip-hop} culture. He also explains how the government supports pop music via grants and the "{tag: Cancon}" regulations requiring broadcasters to air a certain amount of Canadian music. Ben also recommends two up-and-coming Canadian artists: {tag: Inuk} throat singer {artist: Tanya Tagaq} and {tag: Acadian} {genre: folk-rock}er {artist: Lisa LeBlanc}.

Jim and Greg also dig through the Sound Opinions archives and share their favorite performances and interviews from Canadian artists, including a [stripped down song](http://soundopinions.org/show/290/) from Montreal's [{artist: Arcade Fire}](http://soundopinions.org/show/85/), a conversation with {place: Toronto}'s [{artist: Feist}](http://soundopinions.org/show/13/) from early in her career, and a performance from the {place: Vancouver} supergroup [{artist: The New Pornographers}](http://soundopinions.org/show/105/). Plus, they revisit their conversation with the most Canadian of all bands: [{artist: Rush}](http://soundopinions.org/show/535/).

## 00:45:34 Review: Alejandro Escovedo
![Burn Something Beautiful](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/fd/39/95/fd39958a-f35e-3cd5-a1a7-fd46e183e0a5/source/600x600bb.jpg "4034262/1151613661")
Overcoming Hepatits C and narrowly escaping a brush with a hurricane was the backdrop for the new record, {album: Burn Something Beautiful}, from {place: Texas}-based musician {artist: Alejandro Escovedo}. With a decades-spanning career starting in {genre: punk} bands in the 1970s, the 65-year old guitarist is no stranger to the stage [({tag: or Sound Opinions)}](http://soundopinions.org/search/?index=alejandroescovedo). {host: Greg }says this "feedback drenched" album is the audio catharsis of Escovedo's recent struggles. He played this summer's Pitchfork festival and Greg said it sounded like a "19-year old kid with something to prove." {host: Jim} says it can be easy giving an aging artists a pass based on a long-storied career, but {album: Burn Something Beautiful} stands on its own. "Vital, vibrant and essential" are all words Jim uses to describe this double {tag: Buy It} record. 


## 00:51:06 DIJ: Jim

What better way to end a show about the music of {place: Canada} than bringing a track by a Canadian band to the {tag: desert island}? This week, {host: Jim} chose the song "{track: Hyper Faster}" by the {genre: stoner metal} band {artist: Sheavy}. Sheavey was a band that came out of {place: Newfoundland} in the early {era: '90s}. They are recognized most for blending hard rock in the tradition of {era: '70s} bands like {artist: Black Sabbath} and {artist: Deep Purple}, with '90s flavored {genre: psychedelia}. While the group sort of lost their way when their leader {name: Ren Squires} left in 2004, this 2000 song is peak Sheavy and a perfectly Canadian choice to bring to the desert island.
