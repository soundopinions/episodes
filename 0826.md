## 00:00:55 Review: Lil Nas X

![Lil Nas X MONTERO](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/826/1J12.jpg)

In 2019 {artist: Lil Nas X} made history with his chart-topping single “{track: Old Town Road}.” Now his full-length debut album is out: {album: Montero}. Jim and Greg ponder whether his music could ever live up to his larger-than-life persona.

## 00:09:25 Review: Amyl and the Sniffers
![amyl](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2021/amyl.jpeg)

{artist: Amyl and the Sniffers} are an {place: Australia}n {genre: punk} band working in the tradition of {artist: X-Ray Spec} and {artist: The Plasmatics}. Their second album, {album: Comfort To Me}, doesn’t break new ground, but is great nonetheless if you ask Jim and Greg.

## 00:15:36 Review: Kacey Musgraves

![Kacey Musgraves starcrossed](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/826/Q012.jpg)

With {album: Golden Hour}, {artist: Kacey Musgraves} won not only critical acclaim, but also massive commercial success. Her follow-up, {album: Star-Crossed}, details her experience getting divorced. 


## 00:24:12 Review: Low

On {artist: Low}’s thirteenth studio album, {album: HEY WHAT} partners {artist: Mimi Parker} and {artist: Alan Sparhawk} continue the electronic experimentation they added on their previous album, {album: Double Negative}. Greg especially appreciates the interplay of the noise and beautiful harmony vocals.
