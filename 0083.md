So, in honor of their visit, the hosts will discuss other great moments in rock whistling.

## 00:03:26 Review: The Smashing Pumpkins
![Zeitgeist](//static.soundopinions.org/assets/83/5Q0.jpg)
After formerly announcing their reunion in May, {artist: The Smashing Pumpkins} have finally started touring and have produced an album to be released next week. {album: Zeitgeist} is the band's first record since they ended their {genre: alternative} reign in 2000, but this time only half of the original members are back. Pumpkins' impresario {name: Billy Corgan} is joined by long-time collaborator {name: Jimmy Chamberlin}, as well as two other musicians standing in for {name: James Iha} and {name: D'Arcy Wretzky}. In true Corgan fashion, the band is already making news. In a marketing scheme that perhaps doesn't fit their alternative sensibilities, they've struck a deal with three major music retailers. {tag: Target}, {tag: Best Buy} and {tag: iTunes} are all getting a different bonus track along with the regular version of the album. That means that fans purchasing Zeitgeist at an independent music store will only get the LP sans bonus tracks. This has angered some, but {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} actually don't think this plan is so egregious. In the past Corgan has offered his album for free on the internet and has given many free concerts. And in an age where it's difficult to get people to actually purchase CDs in stores at all, who can blame a band for adding incentives. The real question is whether or not {album: Zeitgeist} is worth purchasing at all. Jim explains how we're in an era of {genre: alternative} nostalgia, and Corgan certainly seems interested in reclaiming the good ol' days of the {era: 1990s} when the Pumpkins were on top and were making music that sounded like nothing else. The problem is that now this music sounds like almost everything else. With angsty rock bands like {artist: My Chemical Romance} and {artist: AFI} on the scene, the Pumpkins aren't really offering anything unique. Both {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} find this reunion recording to be merely an imitation of a great Smashing Pumpkins album, and wish that the music lived up to its title. They give {album: Zeitgeist} two {tag: Burn It}s.

## 00:12:18 Interview: Peter Bjorn & John
Recently {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} invited a group of listeners to sit in on their session with Swedish trio {artist: Peter Bjorn & John}. Many members of the audience had heard their album {album: Writer's Block} or seen them perform at festivals like {tag: SXSW}. But, certainly everyone in the room had heard their catchy hit "{track: Young Folks}." The song has been featured in TV shows and commercials and was recently sampled by {artist: Kanye West}. It provides just a taste of what the band had to offer. During their interview {name: Peter Morén}, {name: Björn Yttling}, and pinch hitter {name: Nino Keller} performed a number of songs, all of which you can sample here.

## 00:43:08 List: The Best of Rock Whistling
"{track: Young Folks}" features some of the best {tag: whistling} in rock history -- some of it done live, some of it done with the help of a sampler and whistlers in the audience.
