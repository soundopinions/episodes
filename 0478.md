# Show 478: Strange Bedfellows of Rock & Opinions on Sleater-Kinney. 

![bedfellows](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2015/bedfellows_web.jpg)

Sometimes the most exciting collaborations come in the most unexpected forms. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} bring you some {tag: Strange Bedfellows} that are actually successful. Then they review the latest album from {artist: Sleater-Kinney}.


## 00:02:03 Intro: Music News
{artist: The Grateful Dead} are coming back from...well...the dead. The four surviving original members of the {genre: jam band} progenitor are reuniting for a series of shows this July at {place: Soldier Field} in {place: Chicago}. These performances will commemorate their 50th anniversary as a band, as well as the 20th anniversary of leader {name: Jerry Garcia}'s death. The band claims these will be their final shows together, but {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} have their doubts.

The buzz is already building for this summer's big music festivals. Major events like {tag: Coachella}, {tag: Bonnarroo}, and the {tag: New Orleans Jazz Fest} are already announcing big name headliners. There seems to be a growing trend of booking veteran performers like {artist: Billy  Joel} and {artist: Elton John} who could otherwise fill stadium gigs of their own. Greg's early pick is the {tag: Governors Ball} in {place: New York} featuring {artist: Björk}, while Jim's curiosity is piqued by the {genre: avant-garde} lineup at {place: Knoxville, Tennessee}'s {tag: Big Ears Festival}.

It's one fine day for fans of {artist: Mariah Carey}. The chart-topping chanteuse will be holding a residency at {place: Caesars} {place: Las Vegas} beginning in May. She'll perform selections from her many #1 singles to coincide with a new release aptly called {album: #1s}. And while it seems like the stuff of sweet, sweet fantasy, Mr. Showmanship himself, {artist: Liberace}, is also returning to {place: [Las] Vegas}, despite having died in 1987. Following in the footsteps of {artist: Michael Jackson} and {artist: Tupac Shakur}, the glittery entertainer will be recreated as a hologram by the company Hologram USA.

## 00:08:29 List: Strange Bedfellows of Rock
![aerosmith-run-dmc](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/478/E50.jpg) 
Sometimes an odd pairing comes off like peanut butter and chocolate ({artist: Aerosmith} and {artist: Run-D.M.C.}). Othertimes, peanut butter and sardines ({artist: Julio Iglesias} and {artist: Willie Nelson}). And the most recent odd couple is {artist: Kanye West} and {artist: Paul McCartney}, with the first single from West's forthcoming album. But during this segment, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} remember the most successful "{tag: Strange Bedfellows}."

## 00:48:40 Review: Sleater-Kinney
![No Cities To Love](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/478/2940.jpg)
For as long as {artist: Sleater-Kinney} has been a band, they have been a divisive subject on Sound Opinions. {host: Greg} is a fan and {host: Jim} is (usually) not. Now, ten years after their indefinite hiatus, we get their latest album {album: No Cities to Love}. The band, {name: Portlandia}'s {name: Carrie Brownstein}, {name: Corin Tucker} and {name: Janet Weiss}, has returned with something to prove, according to Greg. About half the songs of the album are some of the best they have ever done and while the second half isn't quite as good. Despite that, he gives the album a strong {tag: Buy It} rating. Jim is still on the fence with {artist: Sleater-Kinney}. He wishes Brownstein and Tucker's vocals had more melody to them, and he isn't hearing much new. Therefore, he gives {album: No Cities to Love} a {tag: Try It}.
