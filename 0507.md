![Buried Treasures](http://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2015/piratetreasure_web.jpg)

For whatever reason, musicians release great records every year that somehow fly below the radar. Listen as Jim and Greg unearth some of their latest musical Buried Treasures. Plus, we hear the untold story of the "Patient Zero" of music piracy.

## 00:02:19 Interview: Stephen Witt
When digital {tag: music piracy} began dominating headlines in the {era: '90s} and early {era: 2000s}, many understood the issue to be a phenomenon perpretrated by a horde of anonymous hackers. But in his new book *{tag: How Music Got Free}*,  author {name: Stephen Witt} has traced a large part of the story back to a single individual with a name. {name: Dell Glover}, an employee at a {place: North Carolina} CD manufacturing plant, smuggled out hundreds of major recordings and helped leak them online before their official release date. So while the record industry was aggressively prosecuting college students and other members of their own consumer base, one of their own employees was in fact responsible for the bulk of their piracy issues. Stephen Witt joins {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} to discuss Glover's accomplishments, the ethics of {tag: file sharing}, and the music industry's inept response.
