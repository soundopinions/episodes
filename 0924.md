# Show 924: Living Colour, Opinions on Blur & Claud



## 00:00:00 Intro: Coming Soon

In the largely white landscape of '80s and '90s rock, Living Colour stood out with their electrifying riffs, genre blending sound and political lyrics. Decades later, professor and author Kimberly Mack talks with hosts Jim DeRogatis and Greg Kot about her recent book on Living Colour's impact on rock music and culture as a whole. The hosts also review new albums from Blur and Claud.
