# Show 445: The Baseball Project, The Rock Doctors Perform Surgery & Opinions on Sharon Van Etten

![medicine](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2014/rockdoc_web.jpg)

Paging the **{tag: Rock Doctors}**! Jim and Greg help a fellow physician find the perfect surgery soundtrack. Plus, {name: Steve Wynn} and {name: Scott McCaughey}, members of supergroup {artist: The Baseball Project}, talk about America's two favorite pastimes: {tag: Baseball} and {genre: Rock 'n' Roll}. Then, Jim and Greg review the new album from {genre: indie} songstress {artist: Sharon Van Etten}.

## 00:02:13 Interview: The Baseball Project

Summer has finally arrived, bringing us sunshine, days spent lounging on the beach—and, of course, {tag: baseball}. While the game is {place: America}'s *official* national pastime, some Sound Opinions listeners may think {genre: rock} n'roll deserves that title… Thankfully, five baseball-obsessed musicians are bringing the two together. In {era: 2007}, {name: Peter Buck} and {name: Mike Mills} of {artist: R.E.M.}, {name: Scott McCaughey} of {artist: Minus 5} and {artist: The Young Fresh Fellows}, {name: Linda Pitmon} of {artist: Zuzu's Petals}, and her husband, {artist: The Dream Syndicate} founder {name: Steve Wynn} created {artist: The Baseball Project}, a supergroup devoted to making music about the sport. Steve and Scott tell Giants-fan {host: Greg} and baseball-ignorant {host: Jim} about why they love the game, their favorite baseball tunes, and how they're exploring the [unsavory](http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Baseball_Project:13) side of the sport.


## 00:21:18 Rock Doctors: Surgery Soundtrack
![surgery-tools](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/445/ZI0.jpg)
"Physician heal thyself," the adage goes. But, sometimes even doctors need some outside expertise, especially when it comes to music. That's where the "**Rock Doctors**" come in. Every once and a while, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} don stethoscopes, un-shutter the Rock Docs clinic, and help a listener in need of musical assistance. They've suggested music for [shopping](/show/259/#rockdoctors) and music for [training](/show/406/#rockdoctors), but this time the stakes are high. {name: Dr. Michael Frumovitz} is a surgeon and the associate professor of GYN oncology at {tag: MD Anderson} in {place: Houston, TX}. He submitted a [new patient form](http://www.soundopinions.org/rockdocsform.pdf) asking Drs. Kot and DeRogatis to prescribe new music he could listen to during surgery. 

Dr. Frumovitz shares his musical preferences (melodic {genre: indie pop} ala {artist: Wilco} and {artist: Vampire Weekend} without a lot of dirty guitars ala The White Stripes) and explains why traditional {genre: pop} music provides a better background than {genre: ambient} music. He also admits that {tag: surgery} is a team effort, so the prescriptions can't be too abrasive. So much for the {tag: surgeon} ego myth.

Jim prescribes a self-titled album by {artist: Phox}, a self-described "gaggle of goofy wizards performing minor illusions and bigtop music" from {place: Wisconsin}, while Greg prescribes {album: Atlas} by the {genre: indie rock} quintet {artist: Real Estate}. Dr. Frumovitz is instructed to put these records to work in the Operating Room, and after a couple of weeks they see how the medicine goes down. Unfortunately, he and his team found Phox a little too sleepy for surgery, save a couple of tracks. But Real Estate was a real winner.

Do you need to see the {tag: Rock Doctors}? Or know someone who does? Fill out a [new patient form](http://www.soundopinions.org/rockdocsform.pdf) and send to interact@soundopinions.org.

## 00:49:03 Review: Sharon Van Etten
![Are We There](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/445/29R0.jpg)
On her latest album, {album: Are We There}, indie songstress {artist: Sharon Van Etten} trades in the quiet guitar and occasional backing band of her previous albums, for a fuller, more {genre: baroque} sound that takes both {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} by surprise. Greg loves the pairing of Van Etten's biting lyrics opposite the music's lush strings and horns arrangements. He says that Van Etten has finally come into her own  making *Are We There* her most accomplished work to date. Jim isn't as goo-goo eyed as Greg is over Van Etten's move away from her simpler {genre: singer-songwriter} days. *Are We There*'s eclectic instrumentation occasionally stumbles over itself, but on less busy tracks when Van Etten's vocals can really shine through, all of the album's musical faults are forgiven. Both critics say *Are We There* is a {tag: Buy It}.
