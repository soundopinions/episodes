The hosts review the fourth album from UK post-punks, {artist : IDLES}, {album : Crawler}. Lead singer Joe Talbot was a recent guest on Sound Opinions. With Crawler the band is moving past the “bumper sticker” choruses that originally drew people to them and turning more introspective, prompting comparisons to Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds.
