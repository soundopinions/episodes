# Show 514: London Calling and Opinions on Keith Richards & Disclosure

![London Calling](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2015/londoncalling_web.jpg)

{album: London Calling}, the double album masterpiece by {place: British} {genre: punk} band {artist: The Clash}, recently celebrated its 35th anniversary. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} pay it tribute with a {tag: Classic Album Dissection}. Then they review the new albums by {genre: electronic} duo {artist: Disclosure} and rock icon {artist: Keith Richards}.


## 00:02:10 News: 10.02.15

{tag: Pope Francis} just completed his first "sold-out tour" of the {place: United States}. Now you can own your own souvenir, as the {tag: Pope} is putting out a {genre: pop} album called {album: Wake Up! Go! Go! Forward!} To {host: Greg}, the record has a {genre: progressive rock} feel, falling somewhere between {artist: Yes} and {artist: Yanni}. {host: Jim} notes that the Pope wasn't exactly in the studio laying down some "tasty licks," as producer {tag: Don Giulio Neroni} arranged the music around Francis' famous speeches. If  the Pope is trying to speak directly to the population, a pop album isn't a bad way to do it. 

This week, {artist: Taylor Swift}'s album {album: 1989} charted its 48th week on {tag: Billboard}, and one musician is riding the coattails of that success. {genre: Alt country} singer {artist: Ryan Adams} released a track for track cover of *1989* and received more attention than ever. {host: Jim} thinks that without Swift's songs, there's no way Adams would be on the Billboard charts. He also references an article highlighting the "{tag: mansplaining}" idea that people can only realize the strength of Swift's songwriting when a white male performs the tracks. {host: Greg} thinks that Adams is doing some solid marketing, as his music hasn't been relevant in 15 years. What do you think of Adams' covers? [Let us know!](http://www.soundopinions.org/about)

## 00:08:27 Classic Album Dissection: London Calling
![London Calling](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/66/89/b8/6689b882-8e2c-260d-1c46-864d440bade1/source/600x600bb.jpg "522000/684811762")

Next up is a patented {tag: Sound Opinions} {tag: Classic Album Dissection} – this time of one of the greatest double albums of rock history: {album: London Calling} by {artist: The Clash}, which recently celebrated the {tag: 35th anniversary} of its US release. *London Calling* represented a huge leap forward for the {place: English} band. All four members seemed to be at their peak during writing and recording: {name: Joe Strummer} on {tag: rhythm guitar} and {tag: vocals}, {name: Mick Jones} on {tag: lead guitar} and {tag: vocals}, {name: Paul Simonon} on {tag: bass} and {name: Nicky "Topper" Headon} on {tag: drums}. They were paired with the unconventional {name: Guy Stevens} and {tag: engineer} {name: Bill Price} and were able to draw from a variety of influences – {genre: reggae}, {genre: ska}, {genre: rockabilly}, and {genre: jazz} – all layered on their particular brand of {genre: punk rock}. The songwriting partnership of Strummer and Jones was at its high point. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} are both moved by Strummer's lyrics, which demonstrate a very sophisticated worldview. To demonstrate the greatness of *London Calling*, they play two standout tracks: "{track: Spanish Bombs}" and "{track: Clampdown}."


## 00:41:47 Review: Disclosure
![Caracal (Deluxe)](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music1/v4/05/9f/fe/059ffeff-8a92-ec7f-77e4-6210c5392f0a/UMG_cvrart_00602547432469_01_RGB72_1500x1500_15UMGIM29141.jpg/600x600bb-85.jpg "520848228/1001770867")
With their {era: 2013} release {album: Settle}, the British {genre: electronic} duo {artist: Disclosure} seemed destined to take {genre: EDM} and mainstream {genre: pop} by storm. They certainly pushed {name: Sam Smith} into the stratosphere. Then came a successful collaboration with {artist: Mary J. Blige} on 2014's {album: The London Sessions}. But, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} were disappointed to hear the new album {album: Caracal} is something of a let down. It's more song-focused, but also more star-focused with guest vocals by {name: Lorde} and {name: The Weeknd}. Jim and Greg have heard better from {name: Howard [Lawrence]} and {name: Guy Lawrence} and these guest stars. {album: Caracal} gets a double {tag: Trash It}.

## 00:48:23 Review: Keith Richards
![Crosseyed Heart](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music7/v4/7a/6c/2d/7a6c2d82-52e3-a540-c680-c1913503abcf/UMG_cvrart_00602547447968_01_RGB72_1500x1500_15UMGIM30902.jpg/600x600bb-85.jpg "241666/1018381576")
{artist: Keith Richards} is, at times, more of a myth than a man. His riffs are legendary, and his ability to survive his own {genre: rock} lifestyle is almost supernatural. But his new solo effort, {album: Crosseyed Heart}, is an opportunity to show the real Keith, grit and all. The bare-bones production style is admirable, as are personal tracks like "{track: Amnesia}," which references his 2006 brain surgery. But, for the most part, this is Keith-by-numbers, nothing great. So {host: Greg} says {tag: Try It}. {host: Jim} thinks he's being kind and can't understand why anyone would need to sample this record, let alone own it. He notes that {artist: The Rolling Stones}, solo and together, have been letting us down three times longer than they were good! When they were good, they were very good. But this record ain't that. {tag: Trash It}, says Jim.
