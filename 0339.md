# Show 339: Disco Doesn't Suck and Opinions on Beach House & Killer Mike
Jim and Greg remember {genre: Disco} icons {artist: Donna Summer} and {artist: Robin Gibb} and defend the much-maligned genre. Later they review new albums from {place: Baltimore} indie {genre: pop} outfit {artist: Beach House} and {genre: rap}per {artist: Killer Mike}. 

## 00:01:44 News: 05.26.12
![Donnasummer](http://static.soundopinions.org/images/2012/Donna_Summer_1977.jpg)
Last week {genre: Disco} queen {artist: Donna Summer} died at age 63. Jim and Greg talk about her {genre: gospel} and {genre: musical theater} roots and her contributions to {genre: pop} music. People relegate Summer to the disco ghetto, but really she spanned many genres and didn't stop working after the {era: 1970's}. Her work with {name: Giorgio Moroder} also greatly contributed to the development of electronic music.

Only days after Summer's passing, we learned of the death of {artist: Bee Gees} founder {name: Robin Gibb}. The 62-year-old had been battling cancer for some time. But before you say, "Groan…the Bee Gees," know that the trio sold 200 million records worldwide, and not all of them copies of {album: Saturday Night Fever}. Their music from that {era: 1977} movie defined the disco movement for many people, but the Bee Gees had hits in five different decades. And they thought of themselves more as blue-eyed soul singers. To honor Gibb, {host: Greg} highlights one of their tracks from the {genre: British Invasion} period called "{track: Every Christian Lion Hearted Man Will Show You}."

## 00:12:11 Special: Disco
"{genre: Disco} Sucks!" [some](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-07-09/entertainment/0907080604_1_village-people-disco-demolition-night-macho-man) would have you believe. But not so, say {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}. The genre often gets a bad rap—silly songs, [silly clothes](http://www.dressthatman.com/view-SHIR3436.htm), silly people. But, the music and the scene surrounding it were much more. Songs like "{track: I Feel Love}" by {artist: Donna Summer} and "{track: Good Times}," by {artist: Chic} are as artful and influential as anything pop music has produced. And, as opposed to the exclusive disco world of {place: Studio 54}, authentic discos and disco music gave a sense of community to many outsiders, much like punk did. You can hear this in tracks like "{track: You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)}," by drag performer {artist: Sylvester}.

## 00:41:40 Review: Beach House
![Bloom](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/26/1b/45/261b4573-3304-f383-b226-8471e45952a0/source/600x600bb.jpg "200823564/509665145")

{place: Baltimore} duo {artist: Beach House} has released a fourth album called {album: Bloom}. And fans can expect more of what they love about the band: {name: Victoria Legrand}'s beautiful, but deadpanned voice and {name: Alex Scally}'s shimmering keyboards and muted drums. {host: Greg} likes this sound, but feels like he's on a merry-go-round with the band. They seem afraid to go anywhere further. So he says {tag: Burn It}. {host: Jim} explains that even hipsters need make out or chill out music. This is no {artist: Cocteau Twins} or {artist: Nico}, but a great addition to your collection if you are looking for something quiet. If you are going to get one Beach House album, {album: Bloom} is the {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:47:49 Review: Killer Mike
![R.A.P. Music](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/8d/b9/54/8db95421-ec3f-2ba8-83c3-af17839be60d/source/600x600bb.jpg "1320637/524412438")

{artist: Killer Mike} made his debut with a great cameo on the {era: 2000} {artist: Outkast} record {tag: Stankonia}. Now he's released his 6th album called {album: R.A.P. Music.} {host: Jim} admits this is a "{genre: gangsta rap}" record, but it manages to rise above all the clichés you associate with that. Killer Mike goes back to black music's earliest influences, and his belief in the power of music is nothing short of inspirational. {host: Greg} agrees, calling {album: R.A.P. Music} a hip hop classic. He and producer {name: El-P} are celebrating hardcore rap, while spanning a huge range in terms of subject matter and sound. Killer Mike gets a double {tag: Buy It}.
