# Show 413: Neko Case & Opinions on Paul McCartney

![Neko](http://static.soundopinions.org/images/2013/nekocase.jpg)

{artist: Neko Case} returns to her old {place: Chicago} stomping grounds for a special live Sound Opinions recording at {place: The Hideout}. Then {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} review the latest from Sir {artist: Paul McCartney}.


## 00:01:49 News: 10.25.13
Social media continues to be controversial terrain when it comes to music. This week comes the announcement that {tag: Twitter} has shuttered its music app. "What music app?" you say. #Music has been a rare flop for Twitter. It was introduced with great fanfare months ago, but hasn't made any noise. And so the company is rethinking its strategy. {tag: Instagram} is another social networking tool much beloved by those in the entertainment industry. But *The Guardian* is [wondering](http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/18/instagram-ruins-music-videos-rihanna-britney-spears) if it's killing music videos. "Heck no," YouTube might respond. It's hosting its first {tag: YouTube} Music Awards next month. Place your vote at youtube.com/musicawards.

The Brits continue to surprise us stateside. The #1 album this week is not by Sir {artist: Paul McCartney}. It's not by {artist: Pearl Jam}. It's byâ€¦{artist: John Newman}? This up and comer (and {artist: Rick Astley} look-alike) debuted in the top slot on the U.K. {tag: Billboard} chart. {artist: Pearl Jam} fared better at home with its 5th number one. [Listen](https://soundcloud.com/soundopinions/sound-opinions-reviews-3)  to Jim and Greg's review. 

## 00:07:46 Interview: Neko Case
Singer/songwriter {artist: Neko Case} is back with a new album called {album: The Worse Things Get, The Harder I Fight, The Harder I Fight, The More I Love You}. This is Neko's 6th release, and over the past few years she's let the world see a little more of her humor and unique point of view. Granted, she still lives quite privately on a farm in {place: Vermont}, but the songs on this album, not to mention all the [tweets](https://twitter.com/NekoCase), are more revealing than ever. The album is also poised to bring Neko the biggest profile of her career, so {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} thought it would be fun to bring her back to the place where it all started: the {place: Chicago} music club, {place: The Hideout}. She worked as a bartender there in the early {era: 2000s}, and even bunked upstairs. She performs songs from the new album with {name: Eric Bachmann} & {name: Kelly Hogan}.

## 00:44:34 Review: Paul McCartney
![NEW (Deluxe Edition)](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music4/v4/ab/c7/b5/abc7b50f-c924-83f5-a046-862059cf94cf/source/600x600bb.jpg "12224/694874649")
The end of {artist: The Beatles} certainly hasn't slowed the output of {artist: Paul McCartney}. This year, Macca releases his 16th solo album called {album: New}. He's teamed up with a stable of pop music super producers like {name: Mark Ronson} ({artist: Lily Allen} and {artist: Bruno Mars}) and {name: Paul Epworth} ({artist: Florence & the Machine} and {artist: Adele}). {host: Greg} [thinks](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-10-15/entertainment/sc-ent-1015-music-paul-mccartney-20131015_1_paul-mccartney-electric-arguments-mark-ronson) the recording sessions with these hotshot producers brought bits of brilliance to the album. But the other bits are too undercooked and tired to earn the record more than a {tag: Burn It}. {host: Jim} also [appreciates](http://www.wbez.org/blogs/jim-derogatis/2013-10/fogey-rock-paul-mccartney-and-pearl-jam-struggle-be-here-now-108951) the sound of the record. However, lyrically, McCartney has done better. Jim doubts McCartney's team has the courage to tell him, making New a {tag: Burn It}.


## 00:51:16 DIJ: Greg
Talking about {artist: Paul McCartney} got {host: Greg} thinking about one of The Beatles' longtime friends and contemporaries: {artist: Harry Nilsson}. Nilsson was especially fond of {name: John Lennon}, and the two collaborated on a {era: 1974} album called {album: Pussy Cats}. The results, though, were a bit... out there, perhaps because of all the drugs, drink and heartbreak. But that dark mood piqued Greg's interest, and he chooses the song "{track: Black Sails}" for a rainy day on the desert island.
