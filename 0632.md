![Alex Cox](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2018/alexcox_web.jpg)

Few filmmakers have embodied the punk aesthetic like {name: Alex Cox}. He joins {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} to discuss the classic {place: LA} {genre: punk} soundtrack to {album: Repo Man}, the making of the {artist: Sex Pistols} biopic {album: Sid and Nancy}, and his fruitful collaborations with {artist: Joe Strummer}.  Plus, a review of the new album from {name: Pharrell Williams}'s side project {artist: N.E.R.D.}

## 00:02:08 Interview: Alex Cox
![Repo Man](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2018/repoman_web.jpg)
Filmmaker {name: Alex Cox} joins {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} this week for a lively conversation about his {genre: punk} rock-infused movies like {album: Repo Man}, {album: Sid and Nancy}, and {album: Walker}. Though originally from {place: Liverpool}, Cox first encountered punk rock through the {place: Los Angeles} scene of bands like {artist: Fear}, {artist: Suicidal Tendencies}, and {artist: Black Flag}. When he made his debut film {album: Repo Man} in 1984, he enlisted all his favorite bands for the soundtrack. The movie was initially a flop, but the popularity of that legendary soundtrack album eventually turned it into a cult classic. Cox followed up that with another definitive punk film – {album: Sid and Nancy}, a biopic of the {artist: Sex Pistols}' {name: Sid Vicious} and his girlfriend {name: Nancy Spungen}.

{album: Sid and Nancy} was the beginning of a long collaboration between Cox and {artist: Joe Strummer} of {artist: The Clash}. Strummer appeared in and composed for the {genre: spaghetti western} homage {album: Straight to Hell} and the controversial 1987 film {album: Walker}. Alex Cox speaks with Jim and Greg about working with Strummer, enlisting both {artist: Iggy Pop} and {name: Michael Nesmith} of {artist: The Monkees} to make {album: Repo Man}, and the difficulties of making political films in Hollywood.

## 00:44:02 Review: N.E.R.D.
![NO ONE EVER REALLY DIES](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music118/v4/29/9d/48/299d48ac-8b8b-1e51-f14b-4a044953294d/source/600x600bb.jpg "626510/1311935265")
 
After a seven year hiatus, {artist: N.E.R.D.} (the {artist: Pharrell Williams}/{artist: Neptunes} side project) has returned with their fourth album {album: No_One Ever Really Dies}.  As {artist: The Neptunes}, {artist: Chad Hugo} & Pharrell crafted synthy, quirky, poppy {genre: hip hop} and {genre: R&B} for the likes of {artist: Jay-Z} and {artist: Kelis} in the {era: 1990s} and early {era: '00s}. Then in 1999, they formed N.E.R.D. with {artist: Shay Haley}. In the time since N.E.R.D.'s last album, 2010's {artist: Nothing}, Pharrell Williams has made a name for himself as a solo artist. Most notably, he achieved mainstream success with the smash hit "{track: Happy}," all while maintaining his signature sense of quirk. Greg says it's that quirkiness, along with a knack for hooks that attracted him to their sound in the first place. He likes this effort for its "weird, buzzy tone" and its psychedelic energy.  {host: Greg} gives it a {tag: Buy It}. {host: Jim} calls N.E.R.D. an "experimental garage band." He adds this project has an uneven success rate with its long list of collaborations, including tracks with {artist: Rihanna}, {artist: Kendrick Lamar}, and {artist: Ed Sheeran}. Jim gives it a {tag: Try It}. 

## 00:51:14 DIJ: Jim
The new year has inspired {host: Jim}'s pick for this week's {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}. Jim celebrated many a New Year's Eve at the bar {tag: Maxwell's} in {place: Hoboken}. Recently, he was thinking about the December 31st evening he spent watching the group {artist: Human Switchboard} perform. Human Switchboard was a band out of the {place: Cleveland}, Ohio scene that blended elements of {genre: rock}, {genre: funk} and {genre: punk} to create their own unique sound. Once they moved to {place: New York City} in the {era: '80s}, they played clubs in and around the city back when people used to dance to {genre: New Wave} music. Jim chose the track "{track: (Say No To) Saturday's Girl}" and it has him grooving in the new year.
