# Show 632: Alex Cox & Opinions on N.E.R.D.

![Alex Cox](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2018/alexcox_web.jpg)

Few filmmakers have embodied the punk aesthetic like {name : Alex Cox}. He joins {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} to discuss the classic {place : LA}  {genre : punk} soundtrack to {album : Repo Man}, the making of the {artist : Sex Pistols} biopic {album : Sid and Nancy}, and his fruitful collaborations with {artist : Joe Strummer}.  Plus, a review of the new album from {name : Pharrell Williams}'s side project {artist : N.E.R.D.}



## 00:02:08 Interview: Alex Cox

![Repo Man](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/632/3K0.jpg)

Filmmaker {name : Alex Cox} joins {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} this week for a lively conversation about his {genre : punk} rock-infused movies like {album : Repo Man}, {album : Sid and Nancy}, and {album : Walker}. Though originally from {place : Liverpool}, Cox first encountered punk rock through the {place : Los Angeles} scene of bands like {artist : Fear}, {artist : Suicidal Tendencies}, and {artist : Black Flag}. When he made his debut film {album : Repo Man} in 1984, he enlisted all his favorite bands for the soundtrack. The movie was initially a flop, but the popularity of that legendary soundtrack album eventually turned it into a cult classic. Cox followed up that with another definitive punk film – {album : Sid and Nancy}, a biopic of the {artist : Sex Pistols}' {name : Sid Vicious} and his girlfriend {name : Nancy Spungen}.

{album : Sid and Nancy} was the beginning of a long collaboration between Cox and {artist : Joe Strummer} of {artist : The Clash}. Strummer appeared in and composed for the {genre : spaghetti western} homage {album : Straight to Hell} and the controversial 1987 film {album : Walker}. Alex Cox speaks with Jim and Greg about working with Strummer, enlisting both {artist : Iggy Pop} and {name : Michael Nesmith} of {artist : The Monkees} to make {album : Repo Man}, and the difficulties of making political films in Hollywood.



## 00:44:02 Review: N.E.R.D.

![NO ONE EVER REALLY DIES](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/632/21E0.jpg)

After a seven year hiatus, {artist : N.E.R.D.} (the {artist : Pharrell Williams}/{artist : Neptunes} side project) has returned with their fourth album {album : No_One Ever Really Dies}.  As {artist : The Neptunes}, {artist : Chad Hugo} & Pharrell crafted synthy, quirky, poppy {genre : hip hop} and {genre : R&B} for the likes of {artist : Jay-Z} and {artist : Kelis} in the {era : 1990s} and early {era : '00s}. Then in 1999, they formed N.E.R.D. with {artist : Shay Haley}. In the time since N.E.R.D.'s last album, 2010's {artist : Nothing}, Pharrell Williams has made a name for himself as a solo artist. Most notably, he achieved mainstream success with the smash hit "{track : Happy}," all while maintaining his signature sense of quirk. Greg says it's that quirkiness, along with a knack for hooks that attracted him to their sound in the first place. He likes this effort for its "weird, buzzy tone" and its psychedelic energy.  {host : Greg} gives it a {tag : Buy It}. {host : Jim} calls N.E.R.D. an "experimental garage band." He adds this project has an uneven success rate with its long list of collaborations, including tracks with {artist : Rihanna}, {artist : Kendrick Lamar}, and {artist : Ed Sheeran}. Jim gives it a {tag : Try It}.



## 00:51:14 DIJ: Jim

The new year has inspired {host : Jim}'s pick for this week's {tag : Desert Island Jukebox}. Jim celebrated many a New Year's Eve at the bar {tag : Maxwell's} in {place : Hoboken}. Recently, he was thinking about the December 31st evening he spent watching the group {artist : Human Switchboard} perform. Human Switchboard was a band out of the {place : Cleveland}, Ohio scene that blended elements of {genre : rock}, {genre : funk} and {genre : punk} to create their own unique sound. Once they moved to {place : New York City} in the {era : '80s}, they played clubs in and around the city back when people used to dance to {genre : New Wave} music. Jim chose the track "{track : (Say No To) Saturday's Girl}" and it has him grooving in the new year.
