# Show 168: Unconventional Love Songs & Opinions on Adele

If you are overloaded with traditional, sweet and sappy {genre : love songs}, tune in to Sound Opinions for a remedy. {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} celebrate {tag : Valentine's Day} with songs that honor {tag : Unconventional Love}. Because it doesn't matter who or what you love, as long as it {genre : rock}s.

## 00:01:49 Intro: Music News

It's only February and already we've got one of the biggest news stories of the year. {tag : Live Nation} and {tag : Ticketmaster}, the two most powerful entities in the concert business, have announced a merger. Now one company will control most of the concert venues, ticket sales, and even the artists appearing at those shows. {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} explain how this will affect the consumer. On the upside, the new company, {tag : Live Nation} Entertainment, will do away with irritating service fees and inconvenient internet cluster sales. But, for the most part, this won't be a positive merger for music fans. The new "dynamic pricing" model will leave many ticket-buyers victim to auction mark-ups. In addition, independent promoters will have even less luck launching shows.

In other music news, {tag : Muzak} has filed for bankruptcy. The company that brought easy-listening into elevators and supermarkets across America has been hit hard like so many in this economy. Guess this means we won't be hearing a sax version of "Lollipop" anytime soon.

While many thought he was immortal, {name : Lux Interior}, lead singer of {artist : The Cramps}, died last week at the age of 60. Along with his wife, {tag : guitarist}Â  {name : Poison Ivy Rorschach}, Lux Interior helped to create the {genre : punk} sound we know today. As Jim and Greg discuss, their chaotic live shows were especially memorable. Many music fans are disappointed to know they will never experience another Cramps live show, so they'll have to turn to the next best thing-recordings like their {era : 1980} album {album : Songs the Lord Taught Us}.



## 00:09:41 Review: Adele

![19](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/168/G50.jpg)

{name : Robert Plant} and {name : Alison Krauss} won the top prize at last week's {tag : Grammy Awards}. It was one of many awards handed to artists from independent labels. One such musician is {place : British} singer {artist : Adele}, who took home the often dubious {tag : Best New Artist} award. But, while this title doesn't often lead to career longevity, {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} believe Adele will go on to make more great music. They both recommend her album {album : 19} as a {tag : Buy It}.
