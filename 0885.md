## 00:00:41 Review: Rina Sawayama

![Rina Sawayama Hold The Girl](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/885/151.jpg)

{artist : Rina Sawayama} made a lot of fans with her debut album, Sawayama in 2020. Now the Japanese-British artist is back with {album : Hold The Girl}. It's clear she's a very talented pop artist, but Jim and Greg wonder what her unique perspective is when she's not recreating her influences.



## 00:07:23 Review: Brian Eno

![Brian Eno FOREVERANDEVERNOMORE](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/885/CB1.jpg)

{artist : Brian Eno} is one of Jim's favorite artists and producers. His new album {album : Foreverandevernomore} is the first to feature Eno's voice in 17 years. However, his new approach to singing is too detached and leaves Jim and Greg cold.
