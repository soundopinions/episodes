# Show 456: New Wave and Opinions on Sinead O'Connor

![duran](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2014/duran_web.jpg)

Get out your skinny ties and don your best {artist: Flock of Seagulls} hairdo. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} celebrate {artist: Duran Duran}, A-Ha and the best of {era: 1980's} {genre: New Wave} with *Mad World* author {name: Lori Majewski}. Then, Jim and Greg review the latest album from iconic {genre: singer-songwriter} {artist: Sinéad O'Connor}.

## 00:02:14 Intro: Music News
A number of artists are making news with novel strategies for promoting their upcoming projects. {artist: Taylor Swift}, whose newest album {album: 1989} is not out until mid October, has engaged her fans through social media, creating tremendous anticipation for the release. This has been helped by a controversial video for the first single "{track: Shake it Off}." Fellow pop princess {artist: Ariana Grande} has announced a collaboration with with {artist: Nicki Minaj} and {artist: Jessie J} and will appear at the {tag: MTV Video Music Awards} with them. That, along with a relationship wtih Target and a slew of other TV commercials, should push Grande to the top. The reclusive {genre: electronic} artist Richard D. James, better known as {artist: Aphex Twin}, has taken the most cryptic approach to announcing an album drop. He let fans know about {album: Syro}, his first album in 13 years via blimps! So much for a press release. Finally, {artist: Bob Dylan} will also be releasing a new album…sort of. A new {album: Basement Tapes} album produced by {name: T Bone Burnett} features songs partially written by Dylan while recording the original Basement Tapes in {genre: 1967}. They have been set to new music and will be performed by a handpicked group of musicians including {artist: Jim James} and {artist: Elvis Costello}.

## 00:07:35 Feature: New Wave
No one of a certain age can hear "{track: Rio}" without picturing {name: Simon LeBon} and the members of {artist: Duran Duran} crooning off the side of a yacht. They were the "Rolling Stones of the New Wave era" according to writer {name: Lori Majewski}, and through such videos represented everything you either love or hate about the {era: 1980's}—the excess, the sex, the fashion and the pure {genre: pop} production. But, while this was a very visual era of music (with infamous clothes and even more infamous hair), there's a lot to be said for the sound. Jim and Greg talk to Lori about her new book {tag: *Mad World: An Oral History of New Wave Artists and the Songs That Defined the 1980's*}, co-written with {name: Jonathan Bernstein}. In it, the authors reveal why New Wave caught on so strongly with pop fans and the media, especially post-punk in the U.K. (Certainly the {tag: *NME*} would rather photograph {artist: Adam Ant} than a spitting {name: Johnny Rotten}). And Jim and Greg reveal their own affection for music by {artist: Boy George}, {artist: The Cars}, {artist: A Flock of Seagulls} and most anything brought to the big screen by {name: John Hughes}.

Here are other {genre: New Wave} acts we fondly remember:

- {artist: Duran Duran}
- {artist: Gary Numan}
- {artist: Spandau Ballet}
- {artist: Adam Ant}
- {artist: Yaz}
- {artist: Human League}
- {artist: A-Ha}
- {artist: Kajagoogoo}
- {artist: Tears for Fears}
- {artist: OMD}
- {artist: Psychedelic Furs}
- {artist: Simple Minds}
- {artist: Culture Club}
- {artist: A Flock of Seagulls}
- {artist: New Order}

## 00:49:09 Review: Sinead O'Connor
![I'm Not Bossy, I'm the Boss (Deluxe Version)](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/456/29X0.jpg)
Despite assertions that she wouldn't be making more music, Irish iconoclast {artist: Sinead O'Connor} up and did it anyway. Her 10th studio album {album: I'm Not Bossy, I'm The Boss} is out this month, and {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} aren't terribly surprised by the move as the {genre: singer-songwriter} has a history of marching to the beat of her own drum. She's ventured unexpected territory before with her {genre: reggae} album and a release of "sexed up" Irish {genre: folksongs}. And Jim is enthusiastic about this latest {genre: pop} experiment because underneath the fun rhythms and catchy hooks is the same old Sinead--unapologetically opinionated. {album: I'm Not Bossy, I'm The Boss} is a {tag: Buy It} for Jim. Greg finds less to love about this latest laissez-faire output from O'Connor. The first half of the album puzzled him as it lacks her usual feistiness. The second half picks up steam with songs like "{track: Harbour}" and "{track: The Voice of My Doctor}," which put O'Connor's attitude ahead of the "{genre: adult pop}" production, so Greg can say {tag: Try It}.
