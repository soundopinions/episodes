# Show 67: Desert Island Jukebox Special
As the hosts of Sound Opinions, Jim and Greg often choose a track they can't live without to drop into the Desert Island Jukebox. But, they were also anxious to hear what some of their favorite musical guests would take with them to a deserted island. Tune in this week to hear DIJ picks from artists like Lupe Fiasco, Robyn Hitchcock and Thom Yorke.

## 00:01:45 Intro: Music News
In the music news this week is the announcement that four major radio corporations accused of practicing payola have agreed to a settlement with the {tag: FCC}. In addition to paying the government $12.5 million, they will provide free commercial radio airtime for independent labels and local artists. Jim and Greg talk to {name: Jenny Toomey} and {name: Michael Bracy} of the {tag: Future of Music Coalition} about the settlement and whether this will actually make a dent in payola. Both Toomey and Bracy admit that {tag: payola} has been around forever, and is part of larger issues the music industry needs to tackle, but they're happy these steps are being taken. Jim and Greg also hear thoughts from the heads of several independent labels. You'll hear from {name: Jim Powers} of {label: Minty Fresh Records}, {name: Bettina Richards} of {label: Thrill Jockey Records} and {name: Peter Gordon} of {label: Thristy Ear Recordings}. Each label head expresses a mix of skepticism and optimism, and speaks to the question of whether or not {genre: indie} labels even need commercial radio anymore. Jim and Greg get the last word and explain that payola, like a cockroach, will probably find a way to survive.
