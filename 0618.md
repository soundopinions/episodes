## 00:01:45 Interview: Mavis Staples
Earlier this year, we aired [part one of an interview](/show/593/) that {host: Jim} and Greg did with {genre: gospel} and {genre: soul} legend {artist: Mavis Staples}. Mavis was such a fantastic guest that we had plenty of extra tape that we haven't been able to broadcast until now. {host: Greg} literally wrote the book on Mavis Staples, titled {tag: I'll Take You There}. As he details in the book, activism is nothing new to Mavis. The theme of social consciousness is something that started for Mavis as a part of {artist: The Staple Singers}, and it continues to run through Mavis' solo career. It's a major theme of her upcoming record {album: If All I Was Was Black}. In the {era: 1950s} and {era: 60s}, the {place: Chicago}-based Staple Singers toured the Jim Crow South extensively. It was a learning curve in many ways for the young Mavis, along with her siblings {name: Cleotha [Staples]}, {name: Yvonne [Staples]}, and {name: Pervis [Staples]}. 



## 00:43:49 Review: Protomartyr
![Relatives in Descent](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/618/2110.jpg)
{album: Relatives in Descent} is {artist: Protomartyr}'s fourth album since forming in {place: Detroit} in 2010. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} have loved all their previous records and [had them on the show in 2014](/show/470/#protomartyr). After hearing the new album, Greg declares that they're one of the best rock bands in America and that they keep getting better. He cites {name: Greg Ahee}'s agile but wild guitar playing and {name: Alex Leonard}'s unconventional textured drumming as keys to their sound. {name: Joe Casey}'s lyrics, he says, have an emotional undercurrent with a sense of anger. Jim also loves Casey's elliptical approach to his lyrics, which show empathy for people who don't often get attention or respect. He was hooked from the first time he heard the album and keeps finding things with each subsequent listen. {album: Relatives in Descent} gets an enthusiastic double-{tag: Buy It}.


## 00:51:30 Obit: Charles Bradley

![Charles Bradley](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/618/2DU0.jpg)

The {genre: soul} singer {artist: Charles Bradley} died September 23 from stomach and liver cancer at age 68. {host: Greg} had just acknowledged Bradley on the show as the ultimate late bloomer a few weeks prior, as he was 62 when he finally made his debut album after years of struggling. Bradley made three great records and on his most recent effort, the title track "{track: Changes}" is a cover of {artist: Black Sabbath}'s 1972 song. Bradley covered the song and made it about reconciling with his mother after many years apart. Greg now finds "Changes" to be a fitting eulogy for Bradley.
