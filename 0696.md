# Show 696: True Crime Songs, Opinions on Jenny Lewis & Sara Romweber
![Caution](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2019/caution.jpg)

There's a long tradition of {genre: blues} and {genre: folk} troubadours writing about subjects that are downright criminal. This week, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} talk about {tag: true crime}, or at least allegedly true crimes, that have been immortalized in song. Plus, a review of the latest from {genre: singer-songwriter} {artist: Jenny Lewis}, and a remembrance of drummer {artist: Sara Romweber}.

## 00:02:00 Review: Jenny Lewis

Former {artist: Rilo Kiley} frontwoman {artist: Jenny Lewis}'s fourth solo album, {album: On The Line}, is the most star-studded record of her career, featuring {artist: Ringo Starr}, {name: Jim Keltner}, {artist: Benmont Tench} and production from {artist: Beck} and a pre-MeToo-reckoning {artist: Ryan Adams}. (Lewis has publicly supported the women accusing Adams since the news broke.) Both {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} point out the {place: LA} vibe on the record- encompassing both {place: Laurel Canyon} songwriting and hedonistic excess. Greg says Lewis is underrated as an influence on other musicians like {artist: Kasey Musgraves}, who won the Album of the Year GRAMMY award this year. Jim loves the novelistic detail found throughout the album, citing the line "disagreed about everything from Elliott Smith to grenadine" as an example of this genius. Greg praises her honest appraisal of her own imperfect childhood, "looking back to move forward" and the juxtaposition of light melodies with dark subject matter, what he calls a "classic {place: California} trope."

## 00:11:17 Obit: Sara Romweber

{name: Sara Romweber} was a central member of the {place: North Carolina} independent music scene from her teenage years to her death this month at age 55. As the drummer of {artist: Let's Active}, she was closely associated with {name: Mitch Easter}, who would go on to produce {artist: R.E.M.} as well as many other bands. She later drummed for the band {artist: Snatches of Pink} and in the past decade performed with her younger brother, {name: Dex Romweber}, in the {artist: Dex Romweber Duo}. Dex is known for his band {artist: Flat Duo Jets}, which {artist: Jack White} has cited as a major influence. 

Sara Romweber's death prompted an outpouring of tributes, notably from members of the band {artist: Superchunk}, who described Romweber as creative, caring and inspiring. 

## 00:18:35 List: True Crime Songs
This week, Jim and Greg selected tracks written about true crimes, or at least allegedly {tag: true crimes}. There's a long tradition of crimes that have been immortalized in songs, going back to the {genre: blues} and {genre: folk} troubadours, and before that the {genre: murder ballad} has been a classic trope for centuries. One example of a true crime song is "{track: Stagger Lee}", a hundred year old folk song, popularized by {artist: Lloyd Price} in {era: 1958}. The song details the {era: 1895} murder of Billy Lyons by "Stag" Lee Shelton.  "{track: Stagger Lee}," "{track: Stack-A-Lee}" "{track: Stag-O-Lee}" or "{track: Stack-O-Lee}" has also been performed by {artist: James Brown}, {artist: Dr. John}, and even {artist: Bob Dylan}.
