# Show 519: Low Cut Connie & Opinions on Billy Gibbons

![Low Cut Connie](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2015/lowcutconnie_web.jpg)

Inspired by the artists of the {era: 1950s}, {artist: Low Cut Connie} has dedicated itself to bringing the {tag: upright piano} back to {genre: rock 'n' roll}. The band (a favorite of {tag: President Obama}) joins {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} for a conversation and performance. Then a review of the debut solo album by {artist: ZZ Top} guitarist {artist: Billy Gibbons}.

## 00:02:28 News: 11.06.15
Unless you've been hiding in a cave, it's been impossible to escape "{track: Hello}," the new single from {place: British} singer {artist: Adele}. It sold 1.11 million copies in its first week – only {artist: Elton John}'s "{track: Candle in the Wind 1997}" has ever sold more in a single week span. Adele is basically a music industry unto herself. In recent years, only {artist: Taylor Swift} has come close in terms of sales. "Hello," a 5-minute piano ballad, features production by {name: Greg Kurstin}, who has also worked with big names like {artist: Katy Perry} and {artist: Kelly Clarkson}. It remains to be seen if Adele's new album takes her into uncharted territory, or is just a continuation of her previous work.

Tragedy struck a nightclub in {place: Bucharest}, {place: Romania} on October 30 when the {genre: metal} band {artist: Goodbye to Gravity}'s stage {tag: pyrotechnics} started a {tag: fire}. 32 people died and hundreds were injured. This launched an unprecedented wave of protests against the perceived lax enforcement of laws, culminating in the resignation of Romanian {tag: Prime Minster} {name: Vincent Porta}. This kind of tragedy has happened too frequently, including the deadly 2003 fire at a {artist: Great White} concert in {place: Rhode Island}. {host: Jim} is dumbfounded that any band would still use fireworks at an indoor concert.

## 00:06:59 Interview: Low Cut Connie

{place: Philadelphia} {genre: rock 'n' roll}ers {artist: Low Cut Connie} was founded in {era: 2010} by lead singer and pianist {tag: Adam Weiner} and drummer and guitarist {tag: Dan Finnemore}. They later added musicians James Everhart, Will Donnelly and Larry Scotton to round out their {era: 1950s}-influenced, signature sound. A key element of their music is the use of a {tag: piano} to pound out some raunchy, rock tunes and make people get up and dance. They've released three albums so far: {album: Get Out the Lotion}, {album: Call Me Sylvia} and {album: Hi Honey}. Even {tag: President Obama} is a fan, he put the group's song "{track: Boozophilia}" on his summertime {tag: Spotify} playlist alongside artists like {artist: Aretha Franklin} and {artist: Stevie Wonder}. The band visited our studio a few weeks ago where {host: Greg} and {host: Jim} asked them about how they first formed, their career ups-and-downs and singer Adam Weiner's experience with the TV show {tag: *The Voice*}.


## 00:42:17 Review: Billy Gibbons
![Perfectamundo](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music5/v4/db/ac/78/dbac7838-4544-6a27-3ada-ce50bfb408c5/UMG_cvrart_00888072378889_01_RGB72_1500x1500_14CMGIM02185.jpg/600x600bb-85.jpg "1034576998/1037106092")
If your only knowledge of {artist: Billy Gibbons} is through his band {artist: ZZ Top}'s cartoonish videos, you may be surprised to find he is a gentleman, scholar, and connoisseur. He was also one of the [first guests ever on Sound Opinions](http://soundopinions.org/show/5). Through his father, a bandleader in the {place: Houston} area, {name: [Billy] Gibbons} was able to meet and apprentice under the famed {genre: Latin} {tag: percussionist} {artist: Tito Puente}. On his first solo album {album: Perfectamundo}, the {place: Texas} guitarist is exploring those {genre: Afro-Cuban} roots. {host: Jim} admits that Gibbons doesn't have much to say lyrically, but finds the record deep culturally. Gibbons manages to unite the {genre: blues} and Latin music and has a great time doing it. For Jim, the album is a complete and utter joy – it gets a {tag: Buy It}. {host: Greg}, however, disagrees. He likes the combination of the {tag: Hammond B3} organ with the Afro-Cuban {tag: polyrhythms}, but finds there are too few of those moments. Gibbons makes a failed attempt to update his sound with guest spots from Houston {genre: rap}per {artist: Garza}, and his songwriting is underdeveloped with inane lyrics. Greg is forced to give *Perfectamundo* a {tag: Trash It}.


## 00:49:32 DIJ: Jim
{host: Jim} was saddened by the loss last week of {name: Michael Carlucci}, a guitarist and fixture of the {era: 1980s} {place: Hoboken}, {place: New Jersey} scene where Jim cut his teeth. Carlucci was best known for leading his own band {artist: Winter Hours}, but was also a member of {artist: Red Buckets}, playing behind singer/songwriter {name: Richard Mason}. Red Buckets was beloved in Hoboken – {artist: Yo La Tengo} has recorded two tribute songs to the band – but never achieved national success. In memory of Michael Carlucci, Jim nominates "{track: Jane September}" by Red Buckets to the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}.
