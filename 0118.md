# Show 118: Winter 2008 Review Roundup
It's been 25 years since fans first purchased Michael Jackson's Thriller. Now the King of Pop has released a special edition of the landmark album, and Jim and Greg will tell you whether or not to shell out your dough a second time around. They'll also review the latest from Jackson's sister Janet, as well as Erykah Badu, Black Mountain and Sia.

## 00:01:45 News: 02.29.08
This week music lost one of its great producers: {name: Teo Macero}. Macero is responsible for the inventive recordings of {genre: jazz} great {artist: Miles Davis}. Before Macero came along Davis would record what was essentially a live jazz performance. But, Macero introduced the idea of using the studio as a tool to extensively edit extended jam sessions with Davis and his fellow musicians. Artists like {artist: Radiohead} and {artist: Prince} are still emulating this style of recording today. To pay tribute to Teo Macero Jim and Greg play "{track: Black Satin}," from Miles Davis' {artist: On the Corner Sessions}.

## 00:05:50 Review: Michael Jackson
![Thriller (25th Anniversary) [Deluxe Edition]](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music60/v4/2d/54/b0/2d54b08e-f7c5-2e22-91b6-5ace45e4c2db/source/600x600bb.jpg "32940/273048762")

This season's big records are starting to be released, beginning with the 25th anniversary of one of the greatest selling albums of all time: {album: Thriller}. {artist: Michael Jackson} is the latest artist to try to re-market his music to a new generation. So in addition to the original album, listeners also get remixes of his hits with artists like {artist: Will.I.Am} and {artist: Kanye West}. It's an interesting concept, but neither {host: Jim} nor {host: Greg} think that any of the remixes are successful. They also agree that while {album: Thriller} is a classic, it's not even Jackson's best album. They give {album: Thriller 25} a {tag: Trash It}.

## 00:12:47 Review: Janet Jackson
![Discipline](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/26/ab/b6/26abb6b3-525b-582f-05a9-f0166f1f29d0/source/600x600bb.jpg "621729711/274618723")

Onto the next Jackson...{artist: Janet [Jackson]} also has a new album out called {album: Discipline}. After listening to the S&M-inspired title track, {host: Greg} explains Janet appears to be {tag: erotica}-obsessed on the entire album. He thinks she's become more and more one-dimensional over the last decade and wouldn't recommend anyone purchase this latest effort. {host: Jim} agrees. He doesn't think there's anything wrong with an adult woman exploring her sexuality, but {name: Janet [Jackson]}'s exploration is overdone and sad. {album: Discipline} gets two stern {tag: Trash It}s.

## 00:21:46 Review: Sons and Daughters
![This Gift](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/26/5d/74/265d7424-fb3f-f03b-2191-4d6757a557e6/source/600x600bb.jpg "46927094/272029087")

Next up is {album: This Gift}, the second full-length album from {artist: Sons and Daughters}. The Scottish quartet first gained attention after opening up for fellow {label: Domino} artists {artist: Franz Ferdinand}. Now, with the help of producer {name: Bernard Butler}, they've really come into their own. Singer {name: Adele Bethel} has been moved into the position of front woman, and the updated roots sound, influenced by X, has a more pop sensibility. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} agree that each track is a hook-filled winner. They give This Gift two {tag: Buy It}s.

## 00:27:24 Review: Sia
![Some People Have Real Problems](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51wfQPQqCkL.jpg "13493906/270714547")
After releasing albums by {artist: Paul McCartney} and {artist: Bob Dylan}, {tag: Starbucks}' {label: Hear Music} label is finally putting out music by someone under 40. {artist: Sia} is an {place: Australia}n {genre: singer/songwriter} who made a name for herself by appearing on various TV soundtracks and providing vocals to groups like {artist: Zero 7}. Now she's released her third album {album: Some People Have Real Problems}. {host: Greg} is very impressed by the artist's soulful singing, but he has major problems with her songwriting. He describes the record as a boring, overproduced, tarted-up {genre: pop} record with one of the worst covers he's ever seen. He gives the music and the art a {tag: Trash It}. {host: Jim} completely disagrees and can't believe that a {artist: Feist} fan wouldn't get Sia. He finds her lyrics to be filled with smart social commentary and gives it a {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:36:10 Review: Erykah Badu
![New Amerykah, Pt. 1 (4th World War)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d4/Erykah_Badu_-_New_Amerykah.jpg "54556/274231990")
Ever since 2000's {album: Mama's Gun}, {artist: Erykah Badu} fans have been waiting for a follow-up. Jim and Greg are included in that anticipatory group. She's finally back with {album: New AmErykah, Pt. 1: 4th World War}, but {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} warn that listeners should not expect the same sound. Badu has taken "{genre: neo-soul}" to an even more neo level. Greg describes it as a murky, {genre: psychedelic} sound that owes as much to {artist: Miles Davis} and {artist: Herbie Hancock} as it does traditional {genre: soul} artists. While it's not an easy listen, it's worth your effort according to Greg. Jim asks the listener to imagine Badu jamming with {artist: George Clinton}, {artist: Curtis Mayfield} and a psychedelic band somewhere in {place: New Orleans}. If that sounds like something you'd like to hear, both hosts urge you to {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:44:32 Review: Black Mountain
![In the Future](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music6/v4/45/b2/60/45b26060-f7ff-b925-98ac-18800c1df043/source/600x600bb.jpg "41824629/841018949")

The final album up for debate this week is {album: In the Future} from {genre: stoner rock}ers {artist: Black Mountain}. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} describe the genre as something you either get or you don't. So if you're the type of listener to get down to the heavy, {genre: psychedelic} {genre: metal} sounds of bands like {artist: Kyuss} and {artist: Fu Manchu}, you'll find this record to be pure, headbanging joy...at least according to Jim. Greg is also a fan, but he's impressed with how smart the band is and how relevant their lyrics are. Whether or not you choose to pay attention to the lyrics, both critics recommend that you {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:51:18 DIJ: Jim
While Jim was home sick last week he gave some thought to great songs about fevers. He came up with "{track: Burning For You}," by {artist: Blue Öyster Cult} and decided to add it to the Desert Island Jukebox this week. Jim describes Blue Öyster Cult as the thinking man's {genre: heavy metal} band of the {era: '70s}. In fact, the lyrics to this song were written by rock critic {name: Richard Meltzer}. There are a number of interpretations, but for Jim it was the perfect antidote to his ills.
