British singer-songwriter {artist: Yola} made an impression with her debut album in 2019, Walk {album: Through Fire}, breaking stereotypes as a black British country singer. Her follow-up, {album: Stand For Myself}, breaks out of genre boundaries and is her best work to date according to Jim and Greg. They have a wide-ranging conversation with Yola that covers how the pandemic affected her writing process, differences between racism in the U.S. and the U.K., and her role as {artist: Sister Rosetta Tharpe} in a forthcoming {tag: Baz Luhrmann} film.
