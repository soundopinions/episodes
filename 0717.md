![clapton](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2019/clapton_beatles.jpg)

Sometimes, all it takes for a song to go from good to great is the addition of a guest artist, whether it's a rapper going in on the verse or a guitarist shredding a solo. This week, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} share some of their favorite {tag: musical cameos}. They also review the latest from {genre: R&B} singer {artist: Raphael Saadiq}.


## 00:01:32 Review: Raphael Saadiq
![Jimmy Lee](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sound-images/images/2019/JimmyLee.jpg)
{host: Jim} calls {artist: Raphael Saadiq} one the most important, if underappreciated, artists in r&b over the past several decades. He first emerged in the {era: 1980s} with {genre: r&b} band, {artist: Tony! Toni! Toné}! What followed beginning in the {era: late 1990s} was a series of solo albums and productions for the likes of {artist: Stevie Wonder} and {artist: Solange}. Now, Raphael Saadiq is back, after an eight-year hiatus, with what Greg calls his most "autobiographical" album to date, {album: Jimmy Lee}. Named after Raphael's brother who died tragically in the 1990s after years of addiction, the album delves into the toll of drug abuse.  Greg says there is no album in Saadiq's extensive catalogue that resembles {album: Jimmy Lee}. It's "like he's channeling ghosts" in songs like "{track: So Ready}" and "{track: Sinners Prayer}," Greg suggests, noting that Saadiq is "enacting a role of a drug addict going through the throes of addiction".  Jim says this album channels the "catharsis through confessionals" found in {artist: Marvin Gaye}'s {album: Here My Dear}. He adds that {album: Jimmy Lee} also channels the "clouds hanging over the African-American community" in the tradition of {artist: Sly & The Family Stone}'s {album: There's A Riot Going On}. Jim concludes that {album: Jimmy Lee} is a masterpiece.

## 00:46:40 DIJ: Greg
This week, {host: Greg} is taking a trip to the {tag: desert island jukebox} to share the track "{track: Down At the Bar}" by {artist: Peter Laughner}. Laughner was an influential figure in the {era: 1970s} for bands like {artist: Rocket From The Tombs} and {artist: Pere Ubu}. Along with making music, he also contributed writing to music magazines like {tag: Creem}. He died young at age 24 as a result of drugs and alcohol abuse, but left behind a lot of recorded music. Recently the label {label: Smog Veil} put out a box set of his songs, which got Greg on a Peter Laughner kick. "Down At the Bar" is a perfect snap shot of Laughner's {place: Cleveland} crafted by the man himself.
