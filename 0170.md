## 00:01:49 News: 02.27.09
At the beginning of the show {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} give an update on a news story they've been following–one of the biggest in contemporary music history. Last week they reported the planned merger between {tag: Live Nation} and {tag: Ticketmaster}. This week the heads of those companies spoke at a hearings before our nation's legislators. At the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, CEOs {name: Irving Azoff} and {name: Michael Rapino} were greeted with skepticism, even sarcasm, as they tried to defend their plan and its effects on consumers. Jim and Greg have a very different feeling after this hearing than they did during the Ticketmaster investigation in the mid-{era: '90s}. This time, they think the law might come down on the side of the consumer.

In other sad industry news, {place: New York City} landmark {tag: Manny's Musical Instruments} will close down in May. The store, which was purchased by {name: Sam Ash} in 1999, has served such customers as {name: Benny Goodman} and {name: Kurt Cobain} over the years. Even our own {host: Jim DeRogatis} used to visit the store and "music row" in his youth.

## 00:09:09 Interview: Neko Case
This week's guest is a repeat offender. {artist: Neko Case} returns to the show to discuss her new album {album: Middle Cyclone}. Neko doesn't want to give away too much though. She explains to {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} that she likes to leave a bit of mystery for the listener. Along with mystery, the singer-songwriter has packed this album with passionate tales of tornadoes, killer whales and mating frogs. And, she is literally a "man eater," as you can hear in the song "{track: People Got a Lotta Nerve}." Check out all of the live songs {name: Neko [Case]} performed with vocalist {name: Kelly Hogan} and guitarist {name: Paul Rigby}.

## 00:37:04 Review: U2
![No Line On the Horizon (Deluxe Edition)](//static.soundopinions.org/assets/170/1PS0.jpg "78500/305352554")
Irish super {genre: rock}ers {artist: U2} have a new album out called {album: No Line on the Horizon}. It's the band's 12th album, and after a brief stint with producer {name: Rick Rubin}, they've returned to working with {name: Brian Eno} and {name: Daniel Lanois}. {host: Greg} was pleased to hear that after a couple of "U2 by numbers" albums, they've returned to emphasizing sound. They've restored the sense of mystery and atmosphere on a handful of tracks. But, Greg wishes the entire album was like that. He doesn't feel they quite pulled it off and gives {album: No Line on the Horizon} a {tag: Try It}. {host: Jim} is shocked to hear himself say it, but he disagrees. {name: Bono} was wrong to suggest this record is the band's best, but Jim thinks they are definitely still relevant. And he finds the good tracks so extraordinarily good that they overshadow the bum ones. Jim gives the new U2...a {tag: Buy It}!

## 00:44:19 Review: The Pains of Being Pure at Heart
![The Pains of Being Pure at Heart - EP](//static.soundopinions.org/assets/170/21V0.jpg "419952197/260388755")
After getting a lot of notice from their singles and EPs, {place: Brooklyn} quartet {artist: The Pains of Being Pure at Heart} has released their full-length, self-titled debut. {host: Jim} admits the band has a formula – equal parts jangly {genre: pop} and heavy bottom. But for him, it's a great formula, especially when combined with some of the twisted lyrics. He gives the album a {tag: Buy It}. {host: Greg} is surprised to hear Jim say this. He doesn't hear anything fresh or unique here, and thinks there are better bands using this formula today. Greg gives {album: The Pains of Being Pure at Heart} a {tag: Try It}.

## 00:50:13 DIJ: Jim
As discussed earlier, {artist: U2}, and countless other artists, turn to {artist: Brian Eno} as a producer. For this week's {tag: Desert Island Jukebox} pick, Jim wanted to illustrate why. {name: [Brian] Eno} is a magician in the studio. He turns one sound into another and the result is pure joy. You can hear this in Eno's 1975 song "{track: St. Elmo's Fire}" from {album: Another Green World}.
