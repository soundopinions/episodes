# Show 415: Parquet Courts

Art punks {artist: Parquet Courts} appear at a special live recording of Sound Opinions. Later Jim and Greg review perhaps the most anticipated album of the year: {album: Reflektor} by {artist: Arcade Fire}.

## 00:01:49 Intro: Music News
You can hear {artist: Katy Perry} "{track: Roar}" from the mountaintop on her latest release {album: Prism}. Unfortunately, it's the world's shortest mountain. She shot to #1 on {tag: Billboard}'s album chart last week, but it was the worst-selling week since {era: 1991}. Perry sold 286,000 copies of her 4th album. Compare that with albums in '91 like {album: Use Your Illusion} (685,000) and {album: Ropin' the Wind} (400,000). 
But, on the bright side, Perry's album did earn another distinction: Biohazard. Deluxe versions of {album: Prism} came with seed paper that the singer is encouraging fans to plant and "spread the light." But, {place: Australia}n officials see it as a "bio-security concern."  That's even worse than a Trash It rating.

"{track: Future Shock}," {artist: Curtis Mayfield} sings. Well, that's what some insiders say the music industry's in for if it doesn't start planning. {host: Greg} just returned from the {tag: Future of Music Summit} in {place: Washington D.C.}, and there [heard](http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/turnitup/chi-future-of-music-summit-2013-fmc-2013-summarized-20131028,0,6523241.column) from {name: Tom Silverman}, the founder of the {tag: New Music Seminar}, who said that the digital download era is coming to an end. Rather than continue to fight {tag: piracy}, the music industry needs to focus on the next stage of revenues. Another big change on the horizon? The current {tag: copyright} law, last revised in {era: 1976}, is long overdue for a makeover.

## 00:06:58 Interview: Parquet Courts
Immediately after giving double Buy It [ratings](/show/374/review/parquetcourts) to {artist: Parquet Courts}' full-length debut {album: Light Up Gold}, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} knew they wanted to invite them on the show to perform. The band made a trip to {place: Chicago} to perform at this summer's {tag: Pitchfork Music Festival}, and the night before they treated a Sound Opinions audience to a live recording with Savages. Guitarist {name: Austin Brown}, bass player {name: Sean Yeaton}, guitarist {name: Andrew Savage}, and his brother, drummer {name: Max} talked about their early years (including the "Knights of the Round Turntable"), their speedy recording process and side jobs. If you weren't able to make it, don't fret. We've got [photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/soundopinions/sets/72157634746444423/) and [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qlNDgFcdhc). And while you're at it, [check out](/show/409) the {artist: Savages} set.

## 00:44:05 Review: Arcade Fire
![Reflektor (Deluxe)](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/415/21H0.jpg)
{artist: Arcade Fire} (arguably the most important indie rock band to crossover into the mainstream since {artist: Nirvana}) is back with its highly-anticipated fourth release. Coming off the heels of last year's {tag: Grammy} Award-winning album, {album: The Suburbs}, this year's offering, {album: Reflektor}, takes another stab at some very big ideas. {host: Greg} [appreciates](http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/turnitup/chi-arcade-fire-reflektor-reviewed-20131027,0,4097418.column) the band's continued willingness to take risks, but {album: Reflektor}'s sprawling sound overextends itself onto a second disc that tips the scales unfavorably away from a Buy It. {host: Jim} [agrees](http://www.wbez.org/blogs/jim-derogatis/2013-11/arcade-fire-gets-its-groove-mixed-results-109066) with Greg that the band only hits the melodic and groovy sweet spot half the time (perhaps thanks to co-producer {name: James Murphy}). Additionally, the lyrics aim high as they did on previous releases, but, this time around, are just kind of a bore. Jim and Greg both say {tag: Burn It}. 


## 00:51:56 DIJ: Greg
Greg has had the {place: British} "{genre: folktronica}" group {artist: The Beta Band} on his mind ever since Sound Opinions screened the film [*High Fidelity*](http://www.flickr.com/photos/soundopinions/sets/72157637090430155/) at The {place: Music Box Theatre} in {place: Chicago}. In the film, the song "{track: Dry the Rain}" from {album: The Three EPs}, gets a big [laugh](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppJAkN4m9bY). {host: Greg}'s also a fan of that song, but he thinks the rest of the band's output has been unfairly ignored. The last track off the same album, "{track: Needles in My Eyes}," is another glorious anthem, and it's Greg's Desert Island Jukebox pick of the week.
