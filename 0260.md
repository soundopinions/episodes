## 00:01:52 News: 11.19.2010
The wait is over...{artist: The Beatles} have come to {tag: iTunes}. The famous holdout between {tag: Apple Corp.} and {tag: Apple} has come to an end, and the Fab Four's entire catalog will be available for digital download. As {host: Greg} explains, both singles and albums will be available, but for premium prices. Because of this, {tag: Amazon} immediately brought their album prices down. This marks the sixth incarnation of The Beatles catalog being reissued, not including their first foray into the digital world: the videogame {tag: *Rock Band*}. Perhaps because of this, Greg thought the announcement was rather anticlimactic. {host: Jim}'s response is outrage. He can't believe The Beatles estate is asking fans to re-purchase their music yet again. And he notes that the list of artists still not on iTunes is pretty small: {artist: AC/DC}, {artist: Kid Rock} and {artist: Garth Brooks}.

## 00:05:34 Interview: Teenage Fanclub
Few bands from the {era: early '90s} are still going strong. But {artist: Teenage Fanclub} is an exception. The {place: Scottish} power pop band formed in 1989, and, for most of its existence, has maintained the same lineup: guitarists and songwriters {name: Norman Blake}, {name: Raymond McGinley}, {name: Gerard Love} and {name: Francis McDonald}. Now they're also joined by keyboardist {name: Dave McGowan}. Jim and Greg talk to the band about their roots, their longevity, and the rarity of a band having three chief songwriters. They also ask them about the recording and reception of {album: Bandwagonesque}, the band's third record and the one that brought Teenage Fanclub its first taste of success in the States. In fact, {tag: *Spin Magazine*} voted {album: Bandwagonesque} the #1 album of 1991 - favoring it over {artist: Nirvana}'s {album: Nevermind}, {artist: R.E.M.}'s {album: Out of Time} and {artist: My Bloody Valentine}'s {album: Loveless}. While in the [Sound Opinions studio](https://www.flickr.com/photos/soundopinions/sets/72157625026243409/), Teenage Fanclub performs songs from its new album {album: Shadows}, plus an oldie from 1995's {album: Grand Prix}. 


## 00:43:25 Review: Kanye West
![My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (Deluxe Edition)](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/260/20D0.jpg)
{artist: Kanye West} knows how to get into the headlines. He's bumped heads with everyone from {name: Matt Lauer} to {name: Taylor Swift} to {name: President Bush}. But, it's important not to forget: he also knows how to make music. Jim says, OK he's a jerk...{name: John Lennon} could also have been a jerk. But what Kanye West achieves on {album: My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy} is nothing short of amazing. He combines {artist: Iron Maiden} with {artist: King Crimson}; robotic humming and what Greg calls "{genre: classical} opulence." Greg compares West to ambitious artists like {name: Brian Wilson} and {artist: Marvin Gaye}, but notes that what separates him is his inability to censor himself. That gives his music both bravado and vulnerability. Both {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} give {album: My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy} an enthusiastic double {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:50:21 DIJ: Jim
The life and death of {name: John Lennon} has been on a lot of our minds these days, {host: Jim} included. He recently watched the film {tag: *Nowhere Boy*}, which depicts Lennon in his teen years. One of the scenes shows Lennon first discovering a {tag: vinyl} record by {artist: Screamin' Jay Hawkins}. As Jim explains, Hawkins was one of the first people to bring "fear and loathing" to {genre: rock 'n' roll}. His {era: 1956} track "{track: I Put a Spell on You}" is a classic. It was banned from a number of radio stations at the time, but if it was good enough for John Lennon, it's certainly good enough to add to the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}.
