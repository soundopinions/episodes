![trupa](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2022/trupa-trupa.jpeg)
Geopolitical conflict doesn't stop great music from being made- often it influences it. Hosts Jim DeRogatis and Greg Kot talk with Poland's Trupa Trupa, a band that has always been haunted by the tragic history of its homeland. They also revisit an interview with Israeli musician Tamar Aphek from last year.
