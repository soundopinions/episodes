# Show 857: Life During Wartime: Trupa Trupa & Tamar Aphek

Geopolitical conflict doesn't stop great music from being made- often it influences it. Hosts Jim DeRogatis and Greg Kot talk with Poland's Trupa Trupa, a band that has always been haunted by the tragic history of its homeland. They also revisit an interview with Israeli musician Tamar Aphek from last year. Join our Facebook Group: https://bit.ly/3sivr9TBecome a member on Patreon: https://bit.ly/3slWZvcSign up for our newsletter: https://bit.ly/3eEvRnGMake a donation via PayPal: https://bit.ly/3dmt9lURecord a Voice Memo: https://bit.ly/2RyD5Ah Featured Songs:
