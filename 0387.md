## 00:01:49 News: 4.26.2013
It's been a sad couple of weeks for {genre: rock}. Music lost {artist: Divinyls} singer {name: Christina Amphlett}, {artist: P-funk} bassist {name: Cordell "Boogie" Mosson}, and {tag: Woodstock} singer {artist: Richie Havens}. But the musician {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} are missing most is {name: Scott Miller} of the bands {artist: Game Theory} and {artist: The Loud Family}. Miller died last week at age 53. Jim remembers Game Theory as a {artist: Big Star} revival band that played jangly pop with a literary edge. Albums like {album: Real Nighttime} and {artist: Big Shot Chronicles} we sprawling, sophisticated constructions, he says. Jim plays "{track: Regenisraen}" from 1986 in tribute.

## 00:06:17 Interview: Joe Boyd

For the most part we think that {genre: rock 'n' roll} artistry and commercials don't mix, but in the case of {artist: Nick Drake}, it worked out. A {era: 1999} TV commercial featuring his 1972 track "{track: Pink Moon}," made the English {genre: singer/songwriter} a household name. It was success Drake couldn't enjoy in his lifetime. He died at age 26 of an overdose on anti-depressants after only releasing three albums. But the small catalog lives large today, with Drake's work influencing {artist: R.E.M.}, {artist: Elliot Smith}, {artist: Beth Orton} and many more. He's remembered on the new tribute album {album: Way to Blue}, produced by the man who discovered him, {name: Joe Boyd}. In addition to working with {artist: Bob Dylan}, {artist: Pink Floyd} and the {artist: Fairport Convention}, Joe Boyd produced Nick's first two albums, {album: Five Leaves Left} in {era: 1969} and {album: Bryter Layter} in {era: 1970}. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} talk to him about Nick Drake's own influences, his style and his legacy.

## 00:43:48 Review: The Besnard Lakes
![Until in Excess, Imperceptible UFO](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/85/cc/98/85cc98a3-37f9-093a-5e91-1a359c4ff85f/source/600x600bb.jpg "214980856/601134021")
Greg counts the 2nd and 3rd releases by {artist: The Besnard Lakes} (who [visited](http://soundopinions.org/show/89) Sound Opinions in 2007) as two of the best of the last decade. How does the {place: Montreal} quartet fare on the 4th album? Well, according to {host: Jim}, the key words of the record's title {album: Until in Excess, Imperceptible UFO} are "excess" and "imperceptible." He is happy to hear more of {name: Olga Goreas}' singing, but the melodies just aren't that strong. Jim says {tag: Burn It}. Greg agrees that this album isn't as strong as its predecessors, but it has its own rewards as well. The Besnard Lakes bring slow, dreamy "{genre: shoegaze} meets Beach Boys." {host: Greg} says go {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:50:37 DIJ: Jim
{host: Jim}'s lounging away on his beach blanket thinking about 1994, and he decides to add "{track: Seether}" by {artist: Veruca Salt} to the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}. It just so happens that frontwomen {name: Louise Post} and {name: Nina Gordon} have decided to "bury the hatchet" and reunite. Will their new singles be as good as "Seether?" Only time will tell...
