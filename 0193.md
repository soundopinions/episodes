## 00:02:04 News: 08.07.09
Last week a federal jury concluded that 25-year-old college student {name: Joel Tennenbaum} must pay $675,000 - or $22,500 for each of the 30 songs he was found liable of infringing. He was the country's second {tag: RIAA} file-sharing defendant to go before a jury; the other was {place: Minnesota }woman {place: Jammie Thomas-Rasset}. She was ordered to pay even moreâ€“$1.92 million for the 24 songs she shared on Kazaa. Both of these cases have been high-profile, leading {host: Jim}, {host: Greg }and guest {name: Nate Anderson} of {tag: Ars Technica} to wonder if the defendents are being made examples of, especially since the damages were so high. Adding to the media attention was Tennenbaum's lawyer, {name: Charles Nesson} of {tag: Harvard}, who took this case as a celebre. Nesson tried to use a fair-use defense, but the judge in the case was having none of it. Tenenbaum plans to appeal, but otherwise has plans to file for bankruptcy.

{artist: Mariah Carey} announced this week that she'll include an ad-packed mini magazine with her next release, {album: Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel}. The 34-page spread will include ads for Mariah's perfume, as well as other luxury brands and Mariah-centric content. And a version will be included in {tag: Elle Magazine}. Jim and Greg wonder if commercials between songs are next?

![Black Eyed Peas](http://static.soundopinions.org/images/2009/bep.jpg)
{artist: The Black Eyed Peas} have been consistent hit-makers since bringing {artist: Fergie} on in 2003. Now they are record breakers. With "{track: Boom Boom Pow}" and "{track: I Gotta Feeling}," they have the longest successive chart run in the history of {tag: Billboard}. The last group to do this was {artist: Boyz II Men}. {artist: The Black Eyed Peas} are solidifying their status as the dominant force in commercial music today.

{label: Sun Records} recording artist {artist: Billy Lee Riley} died last week at the age of 75. Riley never achieved great mainstream success and didn't get to record a full album for Sun, but his string of singles were hugely influential according to Jim and Greg. The best way to remember him is by listening to his biggest hit "{track: Flyin' Saucers Rock and Roll}."

## 00:20:45 Rock Doctors: Dan
Health care reform is a huge issue for every American - even rock fans. This week {host: Jim }and {host: Greg} again become {tag: Rock Doctors} to help a listener with a musical-medical problem. Their patient:  the newly 40-year-old Dan from {place: Oakland}, CA. Dan contacted Sound Opinions complaining of a musical midlife crisis. He spends most of his time listening to FM radio, which these days is dominated by commercial {genre: country }and {genre: hip-hop}. What he likes about country music and hip-hop is the storytelling, so that is where Jim and Greg start with their prescriptions.

Dr. DeRogatis recommends former {artist: Grandaddy} frontman {artist: Jason Lytle}'s debut solo record {album: Yours Truly, the Commuter}. Lytle isn't a country singer, but he weaves complicated tales in his music. And as Dan explains, just add a pickup truck and a bottle of beer to some of his stories, and you're all set.

Dr. Kot prescribes {album: Real Animal} by {artist: Alejandro Escovedo}. The {genre: rock} veteran takes a musical tour of his life, referencing a number of artists that influenced him along the way. Dan was completely sucked in by this rock life story and will definitely take this medicine again.

Check out Jim and Greg's conversations with [{artist: Jason Lytle}](show/36/) and [{artist: Alejandro Escovedo}](show/156/).

{place: Vancouver} duo {name: Brian King} and {name: David Prowse} of {artist: Japandroids} have released their third album called {album: Post-Nothing}. {host: Jim} notes that everyone seems to be a duo these days, but Japandroids rises above the pack. Amid the sea of noise are tuneful alientation anthems. He gives it an enthusiastic {tag: Buy It}. {host: Greg} was impressed and energized by the two musicians at the {tag: Pitchfork Music Festival}. And while he doesn't agree with Jim about the strong songwriting, he loves the textured guitar-playing and {genre: gospel}-like crescendos. {album: Post-Nothing} gets two {tag: Buy It} ratings.

## 00:47:22 Review: Regina Spektor
![Far (Bonus Track Version)](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/bb/79/26/bb79267a-637f-745d-cc06-739757071bcb/source/600x600bb.jpg "20006408/317333978")

{artist: Regina Spektor} had some very prestigious help on her new album {album: Far}. Her big-name producers include {name: David Kahn}, {name: Jacknife Lee}, {name: Jeff Lynne} and {name: Mike Elizondo}. Were they worth it? {host: Greg} wanted to like this album, normally he appreciates strong, idiosyncratic personalities, but with Spektor, cute has become cutesy. He finds her weird for weird's sake and was driven crazy by the record. Greg gives {album: Far} a {tag: Trash It} rating. {host: Jim} thinks Greg is just being mean and explains that he learned to stop worrying and love the Regina with this album. While he admits some lyrics are precious, most were poignant. Jim gives {album: Far} a {tag: Buy It}.
