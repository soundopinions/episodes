# Show 161: Radiohead & Opinions on Fall Out Boy

When {artist : Radiohead} visited the show in 2006, no one could predict that the band's experiment with {album : In Rainbows} would be so successful. Take a listen to {host : Jim} and {host : Greg}'s conversation with this year's biggest newsmakers. And later the critics will sound off on the new album from {genre : pop punk} outfit {artist : Fall Out Boy}.

## 00:01:49 Intro: Music News

With the emergence of the mp3 generation has come increasing concern about the relationship between personal music players and hearing loss. A recent European study links loud headphone habits to permanent hearing damage, and in some cases, damage you may not notice for years. Because so many music fans are listening to their tunes via iPods or other mp3 players, {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} wanted to get the lowdown on music-related hearing loss from {place : Chicago}  {tag : DJ} and producer {name : Carolynn Travis}, known to many as {artist : Chaka T.} Due to her life in the music scene, Chaka is now legally deaf in one ear, and has a 60% loss in the other. She is a hearing protection advocate and founder of the hi-fi earplug company {tag : EarLove}.

## 00:09:33 Interview: Radiohead

Looking back at the year in music for 2008, one could easily argue that the biggest newsmaker was {artist : Radiohead}. The band's pick-your-own-price experiment with {album : In Rainbows} paid off big time, selling 3 million copies and earning them a {tag : Grammy} nomination for {tag : Best Album of the Year}. Radiohead's model may be the future of the music industry, but it only seems like yesterday that band members {name : Thom Yorke} and {name : Jonny Greenwood} were musing about revolution in the Sound Opinions studio. Listen back to this re-broadcast of {host : Jim} and {host : Greg}'s conversation with Thom and Jonny, and you can hear that the seeds of change had already been planted.

## 00:44:10 Review: Fall Out Boy

![Folie à Deux (Deluxe Version)](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/161/21M0.jpg)

The {genre : pop punk} band {artist : Fall Out Boy} is back with a new album called {album : Folie à Deux}, which translates to "A madness shared by two." It's not clear if this "two" refers to songwriting duo {name : Patrick Stump} and {name : Pete Wentz}, or Wentz and his celebrity bride {tag : Ashlee Simpson}. But either way, Jim and Greg both think that {artist : Fall Out Boy} stands out from the rest of the mall-punk crowd. {host : Greg} is especially impressed with Stump's vocal abilities. He thinks there are some terrific, short and sweet tracks on the album and recommends listeners {tag : Try It}. {host : Jim} thinks {artist : Fall Out Boy} consistently delivers the goods and predicts that one day Greg will join him with a {tag : Buy It} rating.



## 00:50:30 DIJ: Jim

The final {tag : Desert Island Jukebox} pick of the year goes to Mr. DeRogatis. Both {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} had the pleasure of seeing {artist : Neil Young} on his recent tour. Jim explains that there has never been a Young misstep live although such is not the case with his recordings. In particular, he was not originally a fan of the {era : 1992} album {album : Harvest Moon}. But now he's motivated to give the album and its track "{track : Unknown Legend}" a second look. This shift was partly inspired by the use of the song in the new Jonathan Demme film {tag : Rachel Getting Married}. Lead actor (and {artist : TV on the Radio}  {tag : frontman}) {name : Tunde Adebimpe} sings "{track : Unknown Legend}," as part of his character's wedding vows, and Jim came to realize that it's a classic tune in the vein of other {name : [Neil] Young} greats.
