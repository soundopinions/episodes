## 00:05:16 Intro: Music News

After welcoming new listeners on {place : Connecticut} Public Radio, {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} talk about the {tag : Nielsen}  {tag : SoundScan} report for 2010. {artist : Eminem}'s {album : Recovery} was the biggest selling album of 2010, but the year's biggest selling artist for the second time in three years was {artist : Taylor Swift}. Album sales continued to trend downward, but music purchases were actually up overall. So more and more people are listening to music than ever – especially {genre : rap} and {genre : country} music. And {tag : vinyl} had its best year since SoundScan began tracking numbers in 1991.

As {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} explain in the news segment, {genre : hip-hop} continues to be the music industry's cash king. It's come a long way since starting as an underground street art, and tracing the development of the hip-hop economy can shed a lot of light on the workings of the music industry. As {artist : Jay-Z} famously rapped, "I'm not a businessman, I'm a business, man." Jim and Greg talk to {name : Dan Charnas} about this multi-billion economy. Dan is a {tag : music journalist} who also spent many years working at {genre : rap} labels. His new book is called {tag : *The Big Payback: The History of the Business of Hip-Hop*}.



## 00:41:27 Review: Electric Wizard

![Black Masses](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/268/1X30.jpg)

{artist : Electric Wizard}, the self-proclaimed "heaviest band in the universe," has a new album out called {album : Black Masses}. Over the past decade, the {place : British}  {genre : stoner metal} act has undergone a lot of lineup changes. They've also picked up the pace a bit on their sludgy rhythms. There's still a lot of heaviness and distortion, according to {host : Greg}, but the new album sounds more mainstream and less distinctive. There are a handful of classic Electric Wizard tracks, so he says {tag : Burn It}. {host : Jim} agrees; if you only own one record by the band, and you should, go with {album : Dopethrone}. He gives *Black Masses* a {tag : Burn It} rating.



## 00:47:38 Review: Corinne Bailey Rae

![The Love E.P.](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/268/27E0.jpg)

{genre : Pop} music is filled with great love songs, and {artist : Corinne Bailey Rae} picks her favorites to cover on {album : The Love EP}. The {place : British} singer's last release, {album : The Sea}, was her first since the death of her husband. {host : Jim} empathizes with Rae, but just doesn't like her vocal performance. It lacks guts and soul. And he also questions her song choices. Jim gives {album : The Love EP} a {tag : Trash It}. {host : Greg} finds this review a little harsh. He admits there's nothing dark or emotional about Corinne Bailey Rae, but he hears a new friskiness not on other releases. He loves her takes on {tag : songs} by {artist : Prince}, {artist : Belly} and even {artist : Doris Day}. Greg recommends listeners {tag : Burn It}.
