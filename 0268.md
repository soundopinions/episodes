As {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} explain in the news segment, {genre: hip-hop} continues to be the music industry's cash king.

## 00:41:27 Review: Electric Wizard
![Black Masses](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music3/v4/d0/2c/17/d02c17b9-e4df-49cb-3105-8bda17ec6c74/source/600x600bb.jpg "29438586/965391185")
{artist: Electric Wizard}, the self-proclaimed "heaviest band in the universe," has a new album out called {album: Black Masses}. Over the past decade, the {place: British} {genre: stoner metal} act has undergone a lot of lineup changes. They've also picked up the pace a bit on their sludgy rhythms. There's still a lot of heaviness and distortion, according to {host: Greg}, but the new album sounds more mainstream and less distinctive. There are a handful of classic Electric Wizard tracks, so he says {tag: Burn It}. {host: Jim} agrees; if you only own one record by the band, and you should, go with {album: Dopethrone}. He gives *Black Masses* a {tag: Burn It} rating.

## 00:47:38 Review: Corinne Bailey Rae
![The Love E.P.](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music6/v4/c6/c1/a8/c6c1a80b-3cc1-2731-3fed-ad1d45210e4a/source/600x600bb.jpg "64996022/716029874")
{genre: Pop} music is filled with great love songs, and {artist: Corinne Bailey Rae} picks her favorites to cover on {album: The Love EP}. The {place: British} singer's last release, {album: The Sea}, was her first since the death of her husband. {host: Jim} empathizes with Rae, but just doesn't like her vocal performance. It lacks guts and soul. And he also questions her song choices. Jim gives {album: The Love EP} a {tag: Trash It}. {host: Greg} finds this review a little harsh. He admits there's nothing dark or emotional about Corinne Bailey Rae, but he hears a new friskiness not on other releases. He loves her takes on {tag: songs} by {artist: Prince}, {artist: Belly} and even {artist: Doris Day}. Greg recommends listeners {tag: Burn It}.
