## 00:02:04 Intro: Music News

{host : Jim} and {host : Greg} have been predicting this shift on Sound Opinions for years, but according to a new {tag : study}, by {era : 2010} digital sales will have eclipsed physical sales. Right now 65% of {tag : music sales} are still compact discs, but the trend is going down quickly. Plus most of the CDs are sold at big box stores like {tag : Walmart}, {tag : Target}and {tag : Best Buy}. Anyone who has shopped at those places recently knows that the selection is not always impressive.

Last week guitar legend {artist : Les Paul} died at the age of 94. Paul was a guitar innovator, best known for developing multi-track recording. He and his wife {name : Mary Ford} had many hits, and Paul influenced the next generation's guitar greats like {artist : Eric Clapton} and {artist : Jeff Beck}. Beck, in particular, was very close with Paul. He was not only influenced by Paul's multi-tracking, but also his tone, which Greg explains was singing, sustained and steeped in melody. You can hear the influence in the {era : 1968} track "{track : Beck's Bolero}."

Another obituary in the news is that of producer {name : Jim Dickinson}. His death hasn't gotten as much attention as Paul's but Jim and Greg were very sad to hear of his passing. Dickinson recorded such artists as {artist : Aretha Franklin}, {artist : Bob Dylan} and {artist : Ry Cooder}. He grew up in {place : Chicago}, but was really known as a {place : Memphis} producer. Jim and Greg both talked with Dickinson a number of times, and remember him as a great man and a living encyclopedia of music. To remember him they play {artist : Big Star}'s "{track : Thank You Friends}," which Dickinson produced in {era : 1975}.

## 00:12:59 Interview: The Jesus Lizard

{host : Jim}and {host : Greg}are joined by the original members of {artist : The Jesus Lizard} this week: singer {name : David Yow}, guitarist {name : Duane Denison}, bass player {name : David William Sims}, and drummer {name : Mac McNeily}. As Jim and Greg explain, {artist : The Jesus Lizard} was one of the most influential bands to come out of the {genre : post-punk} scene in the late {era : '80s} and early {era : '90s}. While they had a number of important recordings on the {label : Touch and Go} label, it's live that the band really stood out. They broke up in {era : 1999}, but now a decade later, they have re-formed for a number of shows including the recent {tag : Pitchfork Music Festival}. Before that show they spoke with Jim and Greg and performed live in our studio.



## 00:41:52 Review: Yacht

![See Mystery Lights](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/195/1XS0.jpg)

{label : DFA} duo {artist : Yacht} have a new album out this week called {album : See Mystery Lights}. {name : Jona Bechtolt} has been making music and art for a number of years now, but now he's partnered with vocalist {name : Claire Evans}, and {host : Jim} explains they are reaching their biggest audience to date. For both hosts, this is not undeserved. The {genre : electro-pop} tracks really make you feel like you are floating in space, or are haunted by the paranormal. It's a perfect bridge of {genre : dance} music and {genre : psychedelia}, and both {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} give the record a {tag : Buy It}.



## 00:48:23 DIJ: Greg

For his {tag : Desert Island Jukebox} selection this week, {host : Greg} was thinking about the lasting influence of {name : Jim Dickinson}. He will, of course, be remembered through his music, but his legacy also lives on with his two sons {name : Luther [Dickinson]} and {name : Cody [Dickinson]}. Together with {name : Chris Crew} they are the {artist : North Mississippi Allstars}. Their music is steeped with the blues sound of the {place : Hill Country}. Different from {genre : Delta blues}, Hill Country blues is all about the drone and trance. Greg says it's perfect for all-night drinking and dancingâ€“something he plans to do a lot of when stranded on a desert island. He adds the band's song "{track : Going Down South}" to the DIJ.
