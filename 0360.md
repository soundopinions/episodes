## 00:01:45 News: 10.19.2012
With the {tag: Zune} dead and buried, {tag: Microsoft} is ready for try two at breaking into the {tag: digital music industry}. This time, Jim reports, they're bringing out the big guns, introducing their new music and entertainment service under the industry-leading {tag: Xbox} brand. That's right kids - Xbox isn't just for gaming anymore. If Microsoft has its way, it'll soon be your center for music streaming, buying, and sharing. Is it too late for Microsoft to regain its mojo and compete with {tag: Apple}, {tag: Spotify}, and {tag: Pandora}? Jim says only time will tell, but Microsoft's certainly ceded a lot of ground since its world dominance in the nineties.

After notorious border checkpoint {tag: Sierra Blanca, TX} busted yet another music industry star this week, Greg takes it upon himself to issue a PSA to all tour bus drivers: if you know what's good for you, clean out your bus! Since 2010 the checkpoint has caught {artist: Willie Nelson}, {artist: Snoop Dogg}, and {artist: Fiona Apple} in the act of transporting drugs (and the occasional gun) across the border. Now we have {artist: Nelly}, busted for an impressive 36 pounds of heroin, ten pounds of pot, and a loaded pistol. Guess he'll know better next time.

## 00:06:40 Interview: Ty Segall
Knowing Jim and Greg's affection for pop melodies smothered in noise, it should come as no surprise that {artist: Ty Segall}'s music hits them right in the sweet spot. The 24-year-old musician was born in {tag: Orange County California}, but made his name in {tag: San Francisco}'s thriving {genre: garage rock} revival scene. Ty is nothing if not prolific. Since 2008 he's released eight albums, including three this year: {album: Hair} in April, {album: Slaughterhouse} in June, and now {album: Twins} in October. Shortly after *Slaughterhouse*'s release Ty and his band joined {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} onstage at {place: Lincoln Hall} in {place: Chicago} for a live taping of Sound Opinions. He talked about the {tag: MTV} reality show that ruined his hometown, his early punk influences, and his love of old garage rock. And of course, he and the band performed a raucous live set (we've only just regained our hearing).

## 00:42:10 Review: Miguel
![Kaleidoscope Dream](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/55/72/81/55728139-6b66-8444-4150-d20d0de50609/source/600x600bb.jpg "29254083/561525301")

{album: Kaleidoscope Dream}, the new album by {artist: Miguel} debuted at {tag: #3 }on the {tag: Billboard} chart. But he's still an unfamiliar name to most people. The {genre: R&B} {tag: singer} and {tag: songwriter} had moderate success with his first record and has penned songs for {artist: Mary J. Blige} and {artist: Usher}. And with this sophomore effort, he really goes all out. You can hear influences from all over the map - from {artist: Marvin Gaye} to {artist: The Zombies}. But it's his unique spin and musical chops that make {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} give the album an enthusiastic double {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:49:28 Review: Grizzly Bear
![Shields: Expanded](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music4/v4/80/d3/69/80d36935-b357-e581-cae2-47adde824366/source/600x600bb.jpg "29836830/705342861")

Jim was a fan of {artist: Grizzly Bear} back when the band [appeared on Sound Opinions](show/206) in 2009. But something was missing from their album {album: Veckatimist}. Who knew that "something" was a little {artist: Coldplay}? The harder rocking stomp and grandeur on this year's {album: Shields} fits perfectly with their beautiful harmonies and baroque-pop craftsmanship, according to {host: Jim}. He says {tag: Buy It}. {host: Greg} loves Grizzly Bear's take on chamber pop, and especially the drumming on Shields. But he's missing a sense of immediacy on the songs. So Greg goes with a {tag: Burn It}.
