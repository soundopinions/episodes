## 00:46:37 Review: The Walkmen
![You & Me](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music49/v4/10/5e/42/105e42c0-feee-51c9-7900-ed4d16f837dd/source/600x600bb.jpg "5305611/1074127288")

{artist: The Walkmen} recently released their fourth proper album called {album: You and Me}. The band has always presented a rather boozy mood, so it's fitting that Jim describes this album as about as fun as a hangover. He compares their sound to {artist: Tom Waits} meets {artist: The Velvet Underground}, but doesn't think they pull it off. {host: Jim} is also not impressed by the instrumentation and gives {album: You and Me} a {tag: Trash It}. {host: Greg} thinks The Walkmen do a great job of creating a murky, lost in space vibe, but wishes there was more variety. He thinks only about half of the songs are successes, and would therefore recommend listeners {tag: Try It}.
