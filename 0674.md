## 00:45:03 Review: Greta Van Fleet

![Anthem of the Peaceful Army](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/674/2330.jpg)

The {genre : rock} band {artist : Greta Van Fleet} just released its anticipated debut album, {album : Anthem of the Peaceful Army}. The young band hails from {place : Frankenmuth}, {place : Michigan} and its members are students of {genre : rock and roll}, which is obviously evident on *Anthem*. {host : Greg} says there's no denying that GVF is imitating the titans of rock history, {artist : Led Zeppelin}, but notes that they aren't the first to do so. From vocals to sonic style to costumes to lyrics, this band tries to emulate the magic of {album : Led Zeppelin I}. While Greg believes the group has musical chops, he wishes the band would create an original sound and album. {host : Jim} pokes fun at the albums' serious and dramatic lyrics by reciting a poem made up of one line from each song on the record. He feels like the band members are in costume, wishes they would be more original and take themselves a little less seriously.
