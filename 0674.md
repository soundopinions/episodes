## 00:45:03 Review: Greta Van Fleet
![Anthem of the Peaceful Army](https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music118/v4/2f/b7/80/2fb780a1-311d-fd78-0fa2-d6ae17900a96/source/600x600bb.jpg "646178956/1435351050")
The {genre: rock} band {artist: Greta Van Fleet} just released its anticipated debut album, {album: Anthem of the Peaceful Army}. The young band hails from {place: Frankenmuth}, {place: Michigan} and its members are students of {genre: rock and roll}, which is obviously evident on *Anthem*. {host: Greg} says there's no denying that GVF is imitating the titans of rock history, {artist: Led Zeppelin}, but notes that they aren't the first to do so. From vocals to sonic style to costumes to lyrics, this band tries to emulate the magic of {album: Led Zeppelin I}. While Greg believes the group has musical chops, he wishes the band would create an original sound and album. {host: Jim} pokes fun at the albums' serious and dramatic lyrics by reciting a poem made up of one line from each song on the record. He feels like the band members are in costume, wishes they would be more original and take themselves a little less seriously.
