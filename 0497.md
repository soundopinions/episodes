# Show 497: Zola Jesus & Opinions on Florence + The Machine

![Zola Jesus](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2015/zolajesus_web.jpg)

Electronic artist {artist: Zola Jesus} uses her powerful operatic voice to create a uniquely dark and cinematic sound. She joins Jim and Greg for a conversation and live performance.

## 00:02:00 Intro: Music News

Last year, {tag: Apple} purchased {tag: Beats} headphones and its streaming service for $3 billion. This was an attempt to get away from the already antiquated {tag: iTunes} method of paying to download a song. On June 8, Apple unveils what the new Beats will look like. {tag: The Wall Street Journal} has reported a subscription will cost $10/month and there will be no free tier like on {tag: Spotify}. Beats has also paid millions to {artist: Pharrell} and {artist: Drake} to be guest personality DJS (and to stay away from {artist: Jay Z}'s floundering {tag: TIDAL}). Will it be the next big streaming service?


{artist: A$AP Rocky} topped the {tag: Billboard Charts} this week with his album {album: *At. Long. Last. ASAP*}. However he isn't the first {genre: hip hop }artist to do so in {era: 2015}. {artist: Drake}, {artist: Kendrick Lamar} and {artist: Big Sean} have all inhabited the number one spot. 2015 has had many different leaders as opposed to {era: 2014}, where the soundtrack to {tag: Disney}'s {album: Frozen} held top billing for much of the year. At 5th place comes a surprise: the religious band {artist: Hillsong United}. Our hosts are curious to see how far their fame goes.

## 00:06:30 Interview: Zola Jesus
{artist: Zola Jesus}, the alter ego of electronic singer/songwriter {name: Nika Roza Danilova}, has already released five studio albums, despite being only 26-years-old. While her first album {album: *The Spoils*} was a {genre: lo-fi} effort recorded in her bedroom in 2009, Zola Jesus has since developed an expansive, orchestrated sound featuring gloomy synthesizers and string arrangements. In creating her atmospheric songs, she draws equally on her love of {genre: classical} music, {genre: industrial} and mainstream {genre: pop}. Her latest album {album: Taiga} is named after the {tag: Russia}n word for "forest," appropriate as the music manages to evoke the feeling of the deep, dark woods. The woods are, in fact, close to her heart – though currently based in {place: Seattle}, Danilova grew up in a small town in northern {place: Wisconsin}. She joined {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} for a conversation and live performance at the {tag: Virgin Hotel} in {place: Chicago}. Zola Jesus discusses the difficulty of seeking out transgressive music in an isolated community, her childhood love of {genre: opera}, and taking inspiration from filmmaker {name: David Lynch}, who also remixed one of her songs.

## 00:42:57 Review: Florence + The Machine
![How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/497/1ZL0.jpg)
With the release of their third studio album, {album: How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful}, {artist: Florence + The Machine} have entered into their introspective phase. The album, produced by {name: David Lynch} collaborator and stadium rock creator {name: Marcus Dravs}, was a product of a dark period lead singer {name: Florence Welch} had in her life after a breakup. {host: Greg} thinks the songs that are introspective and address her personal life show real growth among the {genre: stadium rock} songs. He gives this album a {tag: Try It} rating. {host: Jim} on the other hand, hates this album. He doesn't appreciate Florence's propensity for musical bombast and wishes more of the album had the big rock propulsion that the introspective songs lack. He gives the album a {tag: Trash It} rating.

## 00:49:58 DIJ: Greg

All this {artist: Grateful Dead} news has {host: Greg} thinking of {place: San Francisco} in the {era: 1960s}.  And in the era of {tag: peace and love}, {artist: The Flamin' Groovies} were wildly out of step. In the midst of {genre: psychedelia}, the group drew on '50s {genre: rockabilly} and {genre: garage rock}. The band has also often been called a progenitor of {genre: punk}. The Flamin' Groovies even had a song about sniffing glue years before {artist: The Ramones} did. The title track "{track: Teenage Head}," from their third album, channels teenage angst into three minutes. The song cites how they are the children of "atom bombs and rotten air and Vietnams." Greg notes that in a predominately "{tag: hippy}" music scene, the Flamin' Groovies were doing something completely unique both lyrically and sonically.
