## 00:01:45 Intro: Music News
The big music news this week is the merger between{tag:  Live Nation} and {tag: Ticketmaster}. In a move that both surprised and upset many, the Justice Department approved a deal between the two mega-corporations and provided only a few safeguards. As Jim and Greg explain, the DOJ is simply trusting Ticketmaster/Live Nation not to stamp out small, independent competition. The ruling also flies in the face of the {era: 1948} landmark Supreme Court decision against {tag: Paramount Pictures}. Jim and Greg are among the many who were shocked that Ticketmaster and Live Nation weren't forced to give up more as part of the deal. They also fear for smaller venues and promoters, and most of all, consumers.

Despite concern over increased iPod listening and loud rock concerts, a recent study out of the University of Wisconsin says that hearing loss is actually not as severe as in previous generations. The findings suggest that positive changes such as reduced noise levels at work and better overall health are more important than the rise of headphones use and other listening habits. Good news for Jim, Greg and music fans.

## 00:10:29 Interview: Peaches
Jim and Greg are joined this week by {name: Peaches} and her band {artist: Sweet Machine}. The singer and performance artist was born {name: Merril Nisker} in {place: Toronto}, but took on the electro-clash alter-ego Peaches for her first solo album {album: The Teaches of Peaches}. Peaches is now based and her latest album is {album: I Feel Cream}. As she relays to Jim and Greg, she wanted to focus more on the singing. She's also had the opportunity to collaborate with {artist: Pink}, {artist: Iggy Pop} and {artist: Christina Aguilera}. As Peaches says, she waited for the mainstream to come to her, rather than move towards it. She and Sweet Machine perform tracks from {album: I Feel Cream} on the show, and you can hear all the live tracks here.

## 00:42:30 Review: Charlotte Gainsbourg

Next, Jim and Greg review {artist: Charlotte Gainsbourg}'s new {name: Beck}-produced album {album: IRM}. The name refers to the French term for an MRI machine, something the actress and singer spent a lot of time in after suffering a near-fatal accident. {host: Greg} describes how you can hear that experience come through in this album, though without being self-pitying. He also hears a lot of {name: Beck}'s influence and was glad that the {tag: producer} pushed Gainsbourg into new territory. {host: Jim} agrees, noting that you don't need to know her backstory to enjoy the record. Both {name: [Charlotte] Gainsbourg}'s parents, {name: Serge Gainsbourg} and {name: Jane Birkin}, have influenced her sound, but in the end she's her own woman. IRM gets a double {tag: Buy It} rating.

## 00:48:50 DIJ: Greg
One of the many rock deaths this month was that of {name: Dannie Flesher}, co-founder of {label: Wax Trax! Records}. The {place: Chicago} based store and later label defined the industrial sound made most famous by {artist: Ministry}. And it's where Greg cut his teeth as a music fan. So, for his Desert Island Jukebox selection this week, Greg chooses a cover version of {artist: Black Sabbath}'s "{track: Supernaut}" recorded at Wax Trax! Records. The song is performed by {artist: 1000 Homo DJ's} and fellow Wax Trax fan, {name: Trent Reznor}, and can be found on the label's {era: 1994} box set.
