# Show 690: Songs About Writers, Opinions on Bob Mould & Sneaks

![paperback](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2019/paperback.jpg)

This week, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} explore literature's influence on popular music and how famous scribes like {tag: Shakespeare}, {tag: Oscar Wilde}, {tag: Sylvia Plath}, and more get name drops. They'll share some of their favorite songs about writers. They'll also review the latest from {genre: rock}er {artist: Bob Mould} and {genre: techno-indie} artist {artist: Sneaks}.


## 00:01:35 Review: Bob Mould
![Bob Mould Sunshine Rock](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2019/mould.jpg)
On his 13th solo album, {album: Sunshine Rock}, {artist: Hüsker Dü} frontman and serious rocker {artist: Bob Mould} threw longtime fans for a bit of a loop with four song titles referencing the sun and cover art resembling a lollipop. {host: Greg} calls it Mould's attempt at bubblegum pop, while {host: Jim} compares it to {artist: The Kinks}' "{track: Waterloo Sunset}." He says since Mould formed a power trio with {artist: Superchunk} drummer {name: Jon Wurster} and bassist {name: Jason Narducy} (formerly of {artist: Verbow}) in 2012, he's been at a career high. The most recent albums recorded by that trio ({album: Beauty & Ruin} and {album: Patch The Sky}) have focused on the deaths of Mould's parents and now Jim says he's emerged in a happier place. It reminds him of Hüsker Dü covering {artist: Donovan}'s "{track: Sunshine Superman}." Greg points out the melodies are at the forefront and there's a lyrical theme of reconciliation. "{track: The Final Years}" is a wistful look back at time with his parents, while "{track: I Fought}" is like a message to his late songwriting partner {name: Grant Hart}, moving past bitterness to appreciation. Greg and Jim both appreciate Mould's honesty about who he is now.

## 00:08:16 Review: Sneaks
![Sneaks Highway Hypnosis](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2019/sneaks.jpg)
{artist: Sneaks}'s third album, {album: Highway Hypnosis}, is twice as long as her debut release and it still comes in under half an hour. Sneaks, aka {place: Washington, D.C.} artist {name: Eva Moolchan}, works with producers {name: Carlos Hernandez} and {name: Tony Seltzer} on this project and {host: Greg} says she's broadened her musical horizons. The {genre: avant garde} {genre: minimalism} is still there with a {genre: punk} ethos, but with a wider variety of rhythmic feels- from {genre: reggae} to {genre: Chicago footwork} on "{track: Hong Kong to Amsterdam}." Greg wishes she would stretch out on more traditional-styled songs, but appreciates the variety on the album. He's most interested in how she takes avant garde music and works it into a {genre: pop} setting, so he's looking forward to what she does next. {host: Jim}, an avowed Sneaks superfan, was let down by the album. As bizarre as it sounds, he says the album is bloated and fears Moolchan is stuck in a rut. But he hasn't given up and looks forward to her future output!
