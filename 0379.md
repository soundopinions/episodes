## 00:01:50 News: 3.1.2013
For as long as we can recall, the {tag: music industry} story has been a sad one, but perhaps there's a happy ending? It's taken 13 years, but music revenues are finally up, albeit by 3%. That's still cause for celebration, though. Digital music has been a big boost to the record biz, with its contribution to 30% of sales. Which artists are selling? No surprises here: {artist: Adele }and {artist: Carly Rae Jepsen} are the reigning queens.

This week the {tag: Center for Copyright Information}, which includes members of the {tag: RIAA}, {tag: MPA} and many {tag: ISP's}, will begin to alert users engaged in illegal activity like piracy. The system hopes to be educational, rather than punitive. So, after "six strikes," or alerts, a user may lose internet speed or be forced to watch videos about piracy. Will this be enough to curb a commonplace practice? We dunno, but here's a [video](http://www.copyrightinformation.org/the-copyright-alert-system/) to tell you more. And please note the exits to your right and left.

## 00:06:45 World Tour: Sweden
{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} have always insisted that {genre: rock 'n' roll} belongs to the world. In our new series, the {tag: Sound Opinions World Tour}, they prove it by zeroing in on countries that've made big contributions to global {genre: rock} and {genre: pop}. Their first stop is the largest exporter of music per capita in the world: {place: Sweden}. {tag: Swedish DJ} and public radio host {name: Stefan Wermelin} is our guide through the country's musical history. Stefan explains that in the {era: '50s} and {era: '60s}, Sweden was a pop music backwater. Musicians churned out cut-rate covers of American and English hits. The {era: '60s} hippie "Progg" movement injected some originality and artistic ambition into Swedish music, but things didn't really change until {artist: ABBA} hit it big with "{track: Waterloo}." According to Stefan, ABBA set the template for Swedish success. The band created big hits by co-opting the best bits of global pop music and stitching them together with meticulous production. That tradition of pastiche continues today with Swedish {tag: producer}s like {name: Max Martin}, the man behind a hundred-and-one {tag: Billboard Top Ten} hits ({artist: Britney Spears}' "{track: ...Baby One More Time}" and {artist: Kelly Clarkson}'s "{track: Since U Been Gone}" among them). But today, Sweden's also experiencing an indie renaissance in genres as varied as {genre: death metal}, {genre: dance music}, and {genre: Americana}. Decades after ABBA, artists like {artist: The Knife}, {artist: Lykke Li}, {artist: Robyn}, {artist: Opeth}, and {artist: First Aid Kit} are staging a second Swedish invasion.

## 00:42:49 Review: Atoms for Peace
![Amok](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/379/1ZD0.jpg)

After his solo project [{album: The Eraser}](show/33/review/thomyorke), {artist: Radiohead} {tag: frontman} {name: Thom Yorke} went out on tour with a group that could only be described as "super": {artist: Red Hot Chili Peppers}' {name: Flea} on {tag: bass}, Radiohead {tag: producer} {name: Nigel Godrich} on programming, {name: Joey Waronker} on {tag: drums} and {name: Mauro Refosco} on {tag: percussion}. The collaboration worked so well that the group has released an album under the name {artist: Atoms for Peace}. {host: Greg} was impressed with how *The Eraser* really found its identity live, and he has high hopes {album: AMOK} will do the same. But on record, the songs are not as strong as the production, so he can only say {tag: Burn It}. In terms of his unique voice, Thom Yorke has finally won {host: Jim} over. He gets the robotic and alien nature of the voice the electronic musicianship and the dystopian lyrics and says {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:50:17 DIJ: Greg
{artist: Miles Davis} has been on Greg's mind lately, and his revolutionary string of early '70s albums(including {album: Bitches Brew}, {album: Live-Evil}, and {album: On the Corner}) have been fixtures on Greg's turntable for weeks. Miles' {genre: rock} and {genre: funk} explorations can be partially credited to (or blamed on, depending on your point of view) his then wife, {artist: Betty Davis}. She put out her own series of great records after their divorce. For his {tag: Desert Island Jukebox} pick this week, {host: Greg} turns to the first song on {artist: Betty Davis}' {era: 1973} self-titled debut, "{track: If I'm in Luck I Might Get Picked Up}." Betty put together an incredible band of {artist: Santana} and {name: Sly Stone} sidemen (including {name: Larry Graham} on {tag: bass}!), and wrote parts for them that contained more than enough grit and grime to complement her raspy blues roar and bawdy lyrics. Even {artist: Prince} personally told Greg that he uses this song as a frequent source of inspiration!
