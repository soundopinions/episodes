# Show 149: Psychedelic Soul & Opinions on Jenny Lewis and Lou Reed

## 00:01:45 Intro: Music News
Often when {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} discuss {tag: RIAA} lawsuits in the news, the stories seem to paint a dreary picture for the average music fan. But this week things are looking up for the little guy. Last year {name: Jammie Thomas} was convicted of music {tag: piracy} in the country's first {tag: file-sharing} trial. But, now the judge is asking for a new trial. U.S. District Judge {name: Michael J. Davis} believes he didn't instruct the jury properly and didn't insist that the prosecution prove files were actually downloaded. In addition, he thinks the $220,000 fine is completely excessive. The judge is also urging for better {tag: copyright} laws, something Jim and Greg have been saying for years.

The consumer does not fare as well in the next news story. Both {tag: Wal-Mart} and {tag: Yahoo!} Music have announced that customers who purchased music with {tag: DRM} protection will not be able access their purchases for much longer. In Yahoo's case, it is because their music store, and consequently their DRM server, is shutting down. And, while Wal-Mart was wise to eliminate DRM files, Jim and Greg don't understand why customers who purchased songs prior to this shift should penalized. For every step forward in the digital music industry, there are at least two steps back.

Jim and Greg next give their takes on the recent {artist: My Bloody Valentine} reunion show. The influential {place: U.K.} band played {place: Chicago} as their first tour in 16 years, and both Jim and Greg were there to witness it, though one has to wonder if they saw the same show. Both critics agree that the band's 1991 album {album: Loveless} was a masterpiece, but Jim wished they had played some new material. He also didn't see evidence that the band has kept up with the times, calling their dated loops and samples cheesy. Greg was much more impressed and thinks the members of MBV deserve one free pass in terms of not having new material. He was also blown away by their sound - almost literally.

## 00:11:27 Special: Psychedelic Soul
Next up {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} check into the "Psychedelic Shack" for a discussion of {genre: Psychedelic Soul} music. One of the architects of the genre, {name: Norman Whitfield}, passed away recently, so Jim and Greg thought his sound warranted more discussion. As a songwriter and producer, Whitfield helped escort {artist: The Temptations} from their Motown sound, to one that was much funkier and rock-inspired. As Greg explains Whitfield wanted to "out-Sly Sly." By Sly he is of course referring to {artist: Sly and the Family Stone}, who along with {artist: Jimi Hendrix}, are the pillars of the early Psychedelic Soul movement. For a full taste of the genre, Jim and Greg recommend checking out the following artists:

- {artist: The Temptations}
- {artist: Sly and the Family Stone}
- {artist: Jimi Hendrix}
- {artist: War}
- {artist: George Clinton}
- {artist: Isley Brothers}
- {artist: De La Soul}
- {artist: Digital Underground}
- {artist: Dr. Octagon}
- {artist: Gnarls Barkley} 

## 00:40:05 Review: Jenny Lewis
![Acid Tongue](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/149/1UT0.jpg)

After releasing a successful solo debut, {artist: Jenny Lewis} is back with a new record called {album: Acid Tongue}. While the first album was something of an accident, this one is much more thought out, with a cast of famous helpers including {artist: Elvis Costello}, {artist: Chris Robinson} and {artist: She & Him}. {host: Jim} could've done without some of their appearances, but loves this record "to pieces." He explains that Lewis tries out a variety of styles, but all the songs are linked by an emphasis on strong vocals and natural recording. {host: Greg} completely agrees. He is less sour than Jim on Lewis' other project, but thinks that on her own she's made another two much better albums. {album: Acid Tongue} gets two {tag: Buy It}s.

## 00:47:30 Review: Lou Reed

// TODO fix image

Twenty-five years after releasing the original version of {album: Berlin}, {artist: Lou Reed} is back with a live version, as well as a film recording. Back in {era: 1973}, the record was almost universally panned, but {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} both believe that it deserves a second look, and this live album is the perfect way to do it. Greg describes the songs as harrowing, but also beautiful. It's not an easy album to listen to, but Reed brings his old songs new empathy. He gives it a {tag: Buy It} rating. Jim thinks fans are better off purchasing this album than the first one, especially when you consider that {album: Berlin} 1973 wasn't recorded very well. He also gives {album: Berlin: Live at St. Ann's Warehouse} a {tag: Buy It}.
