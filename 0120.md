## 00:01:45 Special: Campaign Songs
{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} kick off the show with a discussion of some of the best and worst campaign songs in presidential history. Check out [this list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_song) and decide which have been the most successful. Certainly {name: Michael Dukakis} could've made a better choice. And, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} wonder what left-leaning {artist: Woody Guthrie} would've thought of {name: George H.W. Bush}'s appropriation of "{track: This Land Is Your Land}." Also, while he hasn't embraced it as an official campaign song, {name: Barack Obama} inspired [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yq0tMYPDJQ) {name: Will.I.Am} track. Jim is a fan of the {artist: Black Eyed Peas} member and producer, but even he won't be voting for this song.

## 00:11:16 Interview: Butch Vig
This week Jim and Greg speak with {name: Butch Vig}. The {place: Wisconsin}-based producer has worked on some of the most notable records in the past two decades including {album: Siamese Dream} by the {artist: Smashing Pumpkins}, {album: Dirty} by {artist: Sonic Youth} and {album: Nevermind} by {artist: Nirvana}. In addition, he's a founding member and drummer for the band {artist: Garbage}.

## 00:41:46 Review: Beach House
![Devotion](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/120/1XM0.jpg)

The {place: Baltimore} duo {artist: Beach House} has a new album out called {album: Devotion}. This is the {genre: indie pop} band's second effort, and they are back with a slow, dreamy sound that many compare to {artist: Mazzy Star} and {artist: Galaxie 500}. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} agree -- this is definitely a sound they've heard before, and much better. Greg says {album: Devotion} is a one-tempo album and challenges anyone to differentiate one track from the other. Jim agrees and can't understand why the band is getting such hype. The Beach House album gets two {tag: Trash It}s.

## 00:48:15 Review: Goldfrapp
![Seventh Tree](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/120/28F0.jpg)


{artist: Goldfrapp} is another duo with a new album out called {album: Seventh Tree}. The British {genre: electronic} act formed in {era: 1999}, and since then {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} have disagreed on each album, including {era: 2006}'s {album: Supernature}. Now it seems they are destined to disagree once again. Goldfrapp has returned to its bucolic, {genre: trip-folk} roots and Greg is happy to hear it. He appreciates their orchestration and lead singer {name: Allison Goldfrapp}'s voice and gives {album: Seventh Tree} a {tag: Burn It}. Jim admits that recently he's been dissing duos a lot on the show, but he can't recommend this album. He finds it completely boring and gives a {tag: Trash It} rating.
