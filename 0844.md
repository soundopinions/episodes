Jim and Greg talk with music writer {tag : Erin Osmon} about her new book in the Thirty Three and a Third series on {artist : John Prine}'s self-titled debut album. Osmon talks about the insights she gained from interviews with Prine's surviving family members and neighbors who witnessed his meteoric rise from postman to major label recording artist in 1971. She makes the case that Prine should be considered in the context of Chicago's literary heroes like Nelson Algren, Carl Sandberg, Saul Bellow and Studs Terkel.
