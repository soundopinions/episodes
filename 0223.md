## 00:01:45 News: 3.5.2010
First up in the news is {tag: Billboard's} annual list of the year's {tag: biggest money makers} in the music industry. The chart magazine compiled the list using CD and digital sales, publishing royalties and touring. And while most of the artists at the top still sell records, the majority made the cut because of their hugely successful blockbuster tours. At #1 is {artist: U2}, who raked in more than {tag: $108 million} in 2009, mostly through their gigantic 360-degree tour. The band is followed by {artist: Bruce Springsteen} and {artist: Madonna}, though a number of younger acts also made the cut including {artist: The Jonas Brothers} and {artist: Taylor Swift}. Two glaring omissions: {artist: Beyonce} and {artist: The Black Eyed Peas}, neither of whom toured in 2009.

In more {tag: Billboard} news, {artist: Sade} is at the top of the charts for the third week in a row with her new release {album: Soldier of Love}. She's sold more than 800,000 records. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} were interested to see so many adult-skewing artists on the charts, including {artist: Johnny Cash} and {artist: Susan Boyle}. It's the older consumers who are continuing to purchase physical product. However, they note that these sales numbers wouldn't have gotten an artist into the Top 50 ten years ago.

## 00:06:26 List: Songs About Radio
This week's feature celebrates an important, albeit struggling medium: {tag: Radio}. Last year national radio revenue fell 18%, and the industry overseas isn't immune either. Even powerhouse {tag: BBC} has been facing tough economic times. While bands have many other methods of promotion and distribution these days, radio airplay still significantly boosts record sales. Musicians are now looking to radio performances as another source of revenue. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} both fondly remember discovering new bands on their {tag: FM} dials. To honor that legacy, they play these great {tag: Radio-Inspired Tracks}:

### Jim
- {artist: Wall of Voodoo}, "{track: Mexican Radio}" 
- {artist: R.E.M.}, "{track: Radio Free Europe}" 
- {artist: Donna Summer}, "{track: On the Radio}"
- {artist: Nirvana}, "{track: Radio Friendly Unit Shifter}"

### Greg 
- {artist: ZZ Top}, "{track: Heard it on the X}"
- {artist: The Replacements}, "{track: Left of the Dial}"
- {artist: Indeep}, "{track: Last Night a DJ Saved My Life}"
- {artist: Public Enemy}, "{track: How to Kill a Radio Consultant}"

## 00:48:38 Review: Peter Gabriel
![Scratch My Back (Special Edition)](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music5/v4/e8/96/7f/e8967ffe-2f8a-ab0b-f446-96ef8800379e/source/600x600bb.jpg "115433/989284837")
While he won't be joining his former {artist: Genesis} bandmates at the upcoming {tag: Rock and Roll Hall of Fame} ceremony, {artist: Peter Gabriel} will be busy promoting his new album {album: Scratch My Back}. Gabriel graduated from Genesis to have a hugely successful solo pop career. Now he's tackling some of his favorite songs on this new {tag: covers} record. {host: Greg} has immense respect for Gabriel and thinks the album concept, which focuses on melodies and lyrics, is a noble one. However, he thinks it loses steam and lacks any variety. He gives this "well-intentioned dud" a {tag: Trash It}. {host: Jim} doesn't understand Greg's criticism about tempo and points out that this is a mood record. He applauds Gabriel for taking a left turn at 60 and gives Scratch My Back a {tag: Buy It}.
