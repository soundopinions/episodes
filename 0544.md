![Prince](https://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2016/prince_web.jpg)

{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} remember music icon {artist: Prince} who died on April 21 at age 57. As a singer, guitarist, songwriter, and producer, the {place: Minnesota} monarch dominated the {genre: pop} charts and had an enormous impact on {genre: funk}, {genre: R&B}, and {genre: rock} and challenged the way the music industry does business. Later, they review the refreshing release from {artist: Beyoncé}.

"Life is just a party, and parties weren't meant to last." Yet the party ended much too soon for music legend {artist: Prince}, who died on April 21 at the age of 57 at his {place: Paisley Park} home and recording studio in {place: Chanhassen}, {place: Minnesota}. Volumes have been said about the late {name: Prince Rogers Nelson} in the past week, but {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} draw attention to aspects of his music and career that aren't acknowledged enough. Growing out of the {place: Minneapolis} {genre: funk} scene, Prince refused to be boxed into a single genre, fearlessly blending funk, {genre: pop}, {genre: rock}, {genre: soul}, {genre: new wave}, and {genre: R&B} to create a sound all his own. He was known as a guitar god, but could really play any instrument he touched and often was the only musician on his recordings. Prince carried on the {artist: Marvin Gaye} and {artist: Al Green} tradition in R&B of mixing the sacred and the profane, sex and salvation. On records like {album: The Black Album}, he created some of the most lascivious music ever, but at the same time, Jim and Greg argue he showed a deep respect for women. Not only did he mentor and collaborate with up-and-coming female stars, but he also was eager to help out his idols like {artist: Chaka Khan} and {artist: Mavis Staples}.

Prince was unafraid to explore {genre: psychedelia}, especially in the crucial three album run of {album: Purple Rain}, {album: Around the World in a Day}, and {album: Parade} in the {era: mid-80s}. He spent the rest of his life toiling away at {place: Paisley Park}, churning out recording after recording – not without quality control issues. But in the past couple decades, Prince was defined by his unpredictable and often transcendent live performances. Prince was ahead of his time in recognizing the internet as a way to sell music directly to his fans without a label. But his greatest legacy will of course be his music, and his influence on generations of artists is immeasurable.

## 00:48:25 Review: Beyoncé
![Lemonade](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music60/v4/3f/a4/50/3fa450bb-4867-9080-28ac-ac2ad45eeb0c/source/600x600bb.jpg "1419227/1107424887")

{tag: Queen Bey} is back with her refreshing new visual album, {album: Lemonade}. In the vein of her last work, the self-titled *Beyoncé*, Lemonade was a surprise release. This time, she put out a one-hour visual film of the same name on {tag: HBO} about enduring infidelity, difficult times and [Becky with the good hair](http://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/music/beyonces-lemonade-who-becky-good-hair-n561531). One of the many things {host: Greg} enjoys about *Lemonade* is {artist: Beyoncé}'s ability to become more vulnerable and gritty both in what she's singing about and how she's singing it. He also loves that she's working with unlikely collaborators like {artist: Jack White}, {artist: James Blake} and more. Greg thinks this is the best work of her career and gives *Lemonade* a {tag: Buy It}. {host: Jim} wholeheartedly agrees, calling the album a masterpiece. He encourages listeners to listen beyond the drama of {artist: Jay Z} & Beyoncé's struggling relationship to the greater picture Bey paints about the mistreatment of black women in {place: America}. He loves that she made an artistic record with some serious substance. Jim gives it an enthusiastic {tag: Buy It}.
