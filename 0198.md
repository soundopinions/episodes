# Show 198: Big Star's #1 Record and Radio City & Opinions on Jay-Z

## 00:02:01 Intro: Music News

This week everyone is talking about music from across the pond. That'd be {artist : The Beatles}, of course. But, another {place : British} artist is also making headlines. UK {tag : rapper}  {artist : Speech Debelle} has just been named the winner of the prestigious {tag : Mercury Prize} after only selling 3,000 copies in her home country. As {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} explain, this is quite a contrast from the highly commercial acts rewarded by {tag : The Grammys}. Speech Debelle is certain to see a sales boost after winning this prize, however it's uncertain whether she'll follow suit of past winners like {artist : PJ Harvey} and {artist : Franz Ferdinand}, or less successful ones like {artist : Roni Size} who amazingly beat {artist : Radiohead}.



## 00:05:28 Classic Album Dissection: #1 Record & Radio City

During this episode {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} celebrate the legacy of Big Star with a {tag : Classic Album Dissection} of their first two records, {album : #1 Record} and {album : Radio City}. Both albums have recently been re-released as a double album, and a new {artist : Big Star} box set is due out next week. As Jim and Greg discuss, the band changed the history of American music without selling very many records. With a sound that combined {genre : Memphis Soul} with {genre : British Invasion rock}, they laid the groundwork for "{genre : Power Pop}" and influenced bands including {artist : R.E.M.}, {artist : Wilco} and {artist : The Replacements}. The original Big Star lineup included former {artist : Box Tops} singer {name : Alex Chilton}, {name : Chris Bell}, {name : Andy Hummel} and Jim and Greg's guest this week, {tag : drummer}  {name : Jody Stephens}.

Following their discussion with Jody Stephens, Jim and Greg each discuss and play a song. Greg chooses to highlight the opening track from #1 Record called "{track : Feel}." The song was written and performed by Chris Bell. While Alex Chilton is the name most people associate with Big Star, Bell really created it. Most of his incredible work didn't see the light of day until after his death at age 26, but Greg thinks songs like "Feel," illustrate the power of his voice and lyrics–many of which convey the problems he faced in his short life.

Jim plays a song written and performed by Alex Chilton from the second album called {album : September Gurls}. As he discussed with Jody earlier in the show, this was a breakout song for the band and one that was immediately adored by critics and fans including {artist : The Bangles}, who later covered it. Jim's not sure what the song means, but for him it's more about the mood that Chilton created. With its sweeping melodies and "pan-sexuality" it's a power pop classic.



## 00:43:10 Review: Jay-Z

![The Blueprint 3](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/198/1ZY0.jpg)

{genre : Hip hop}'s top entrepreneur {artist : Jay-Z} has a new album out called {album : The Blueprint 3}. It's the third in the rapper's {tag : Blueprint} series. For the first he worked with then unknown {tag : producer}  {name : Kanye West}. Then for the second he invited a slew of big name guest stars. Now he splits the difference–West is back in the studio, as are guests like {artist : Timbaland}. {host : Greg} finds the result split; half the tracks are good, half show the rapper on autopilot. {host : Jim} was also disappointed to hear that Jay-Z didn't really explore his life as a business man and celebrity husband in any unique way. But, the voice is still wonderful. It gets a double {tag : Burn It}.



## 00:49:20 DIJ: Greg

For his turn at the {tag : Desert Island Jukebox}, {host : Greg} wants to add a song by one of his favorite "Power Pop" bands. The term was actually coined by {name : Pete Townshend} during {artist : The Who}'s pre-rock opera era. It now describes a slew of bands who use a lot of big melodies, tight arrangements, harmonies and prominent guitar riffs. The {place : Midwest} produces a lot of {genre : power pop} bands, including {artist : Green}. The band has had many incarnations, but it's the constant force of {name : Jeff Lescher} that gives the group its edge and puts them above the rest for Greg. He takes their song, "{track : She's Not a Little Girl}" with him to the desert island.
