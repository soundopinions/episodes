## 00:01:53 News: 4.30.2010
The {place: UK} music industry cheered this week after its record industry, {tag: BPI}, announced its first revenue growth in six years. The 1.4% profit increase is mostly due to the success of digital music sales, which grew by more than 50%. So, it's no surprise that record companies have their eye on the digital world and all of the non-legal, non-profitable activity that takes place on {tag: Spotify} and {tag: YouTube}â€“especially since CD sales are still plummeting.

According to {tag: Billboard}, this year's {tag: Record Store Day} helped independent shops across the country break sales records. It was also "the biggest day of sales for vinyl in {tag: SoundScan}'s history." Of course, SoundScan only began in 1991, but {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} still applaud any effort to support independent music retailers. And, they'd encourage you to check out last year's Record Store Day celebration on {tag: Sound Opinions}.

## 00:06:45 Interview: K'Naan
This week {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} are joined in the studio by {artist: K'Naan} and his touring band. The {tag: rapper} and {tag: poet}, born in {place: Somalia} and raised in {place: New York} and {place: Toronto}, released his second, and most successful album {album: Troubadour} last year. K'Naan left {place: Mogadishu} at age 13 at the outbreak of civil war violence, but the country remains a major influence on his music. There are a number of Somali poetry styles, and as he demonstrates to Jim and Greg, it can lend itself to rap verses. Also, while he appreciates a good love song as much as the next person, K'Naan feels a responsibility with his music and tries to convey the violence and the reality of what he experienced.

## 00:44:02 Review: The Hold Steady
![Heaven Is Whenever](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music71/v4/72/ee/d2/72eed2b2-9cf4-fab1-fc95-740360a540fd/source/600x600bb.jpg "19552743/1176769765")
 {artist: The Hold Steady} is back with a new album and a new lineup. {album: Heaven is Whenever} is the band's fifth record, and its first without {tag: keyboardist} {name: Franz Nicolay}. He was a big part of their sound, so {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} were curious to hear their new offering. As Greg explains, The Hold Steady is something of a glorified bar band, with rambling anthems. On 2008's {album: Stay Positive} they polished things up. And Heaven is Whenever is an attempt to find balance between those two approaches. Therefore, it's a transitional record, and for Greg, a {tag: Burn It}. Jim has come to terms with the fact that he just doesn't like The Hold Steady. He loves {tag: singer} {name: Craig Finn}'s energy live, but finds his vocal style very grating on record. He gives this a {tag: Trash It}.

## 00:51:16 DIJ: Greg
After listening to {artist: K'Naan} discuss the challenge of fitting into the record industry's boxes, {host: Greg} is reminded of another hard-to-define act-{name: Michael Franti} and {artist: Spearhead}. They combined {genre: hip hop}, {genre: funk} and {genre: reggae} in their 1994 debut {album: Home}. To Greg, Franti is one of the great political singers of all time, and he chooses to add the song "{track: Hole in the Bucket}," from Home to the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}.
