## 00:01:53 Intro: Music News

The {place : UK} music industry cheered this week after its record industry, {tag : BPI}, announced its first revenue growth in six years. The 1.4% profit increase is mostly due to the success of digital music sales, which grew by more than 50%. So, it's no surprise that record companies have their eye on the digital world and all of the non-legal, non-profitable activity that takes place on {tag : Spotify} and {tag : YouTube}–especially since CD sales are still plummeting.

According to {tag : Billboard}, this year's {tag : Record Store Day} helped independent shops across the country break sales records. It was also "the biggest day of sales for vinyl in {tag : SoundScan}'s history." Of course, SoundScan only began in 1991, but {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} still applaud any effort to support independent music retailers. And, they'd encourage you to check out last year's Record Store Day celebration on {tag : Sound Opinions}.

## 00:06:45 Interview: K'Naan

This week {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} are joined in the studio by {artist : K'Naan} and his touring band. The {tag : rapper} and {tag : poet}, born in {place : Somalia} and raised in {place : New York} and {place : Toronto}, released his second, and most successful album {album : Troubadour} last year. K'Naan left {place : Mogadishu} at age 13 at the outbreak of civil war violence, but the country remains a major influence on his music. There are a number of Somali poetry styles, and as he demonstrates to Jim and Greg, it can lend itself to rap verses. Also, while he appreciates a good love song as much as the next person, K'Naan feels a responsibility with his music and tries to convey the violence and the reality of what he experienced.



## 00:44:02 Review: The Hold Steady

![Heaven Is Whenever](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/231/21E0.jpg)

{artist : The Hold Steady} is back with a new album and a new lineup. {album : Heaven is Whenever} is the band's fifth record, and its first without {tag : keyboardist}  {name : Franz Nicolay}. He was a big part of their sound, so {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} were curious to hear their new offering. As Greg explains, The Hold Steady is something of a glorified bar band, with rambling anthems. On 2008's {album : Stay Positive} they polished things up. And Heaven is Whenever is an attempt to find balance between those two approaches. Therefore, it's a transitional record, and for Greg, a {tag : Burn It}. Jim has come to terms with the fact that he just doesn't like The Hold Steady. He loves {tag : singer}  {name : Craig Finn}'s energy live, but finds his vocal style very grating on record. He gives this a {tag : Trash It}.



## 00:51:16 DIJ: Greg

After listening to {artist : K'Naan} discuss the challenge of fitting into the record industry's boxes, {host : Greg} is reminded of another hard-to-define act-{name : Michael Franti} and {artist : Spearhead}. They combined {genre : hip hop}, {genre : funk} and {genre : reggae} in their 1994 debut {album : Home}. To Greg, Franti is one of the great political singers of all time, and he chooses to add the song "{track : Hole in the Bucket}," from Home to the {tag : Desert Island Jukebox}.
