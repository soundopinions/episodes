# Show 412: Sound Opinions Halloween Special & Opinions on Pearl Jam

![Jack-o-lantern](http://static.soundopinions.org/images/2013/halloweeen.jpg)

Hosts Jim DeRogatis and Greg Kot get grisly with their favorite Murder Songs for Halloween. They also review *Lightning Bolt* by Pearl Jam.

## 00:01:46 List: Murder Songs for Halloween
With {tag: Halloween} looming large, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} are feeling a bit morbid. They've got Murder on the brain. Here are their favorite "killer" tunes:

### Greg
- {artist: Ike & Tina Turner}, "{track: Stagger Lee}"
- {artist: Eleventh Dream Day}, "{track: The Death of Albert C. Samson}"
- {artist: Snoop Dogg}, "{track: Murder Was the Case}"
- {artist: The Adverts}, "{track: Gary Gilmore Eyes}"

### Jim
- {artist: Iron Maiden}, "{track: Murders In the Rue Morgue}"
- {artist: Violent Femmes}, "{track: Country Death Song}"
- {artist: Dixie Chicks}, "{track: Goodbye Earl}"
- {artist: Neil Young}, "{track: Down by the River}"


### Listener Picks
Of course, Sound Opinions wants to hear from its listeners, as well. Some more murderous melodies:

- Greg from {place: Oswego, NY}: {artist: Warren Zevon}, "{track: Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner}"
- Kristen from {place: Chicago, IL}: {artist: Fairport Convention}, "{track: Matty Groves}"
- Camille Hunt from {place: Raleigh, NC}: {artist: Dwight Yoakum}, "{track: Buenas Noches from a Lonely Room}"
- Fahad from, {place: Bordentown, NJ}: {artist: The Beatles}, "{track: Maxwell's Silver Hammer}"

## 00:48:37 Review: Pearl Jam
![Lightning Bolt](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/cd/Pearl_Jam_Lightning_Bolt.jpg "467464/665391109")
{genre: Grunge} rock stalwarts {artist: Pearl Jam} are back with their tenth studio album called {album: Lightning Bolt}. It comes 22 years after their landmark debut {album: Ten}. Jim and Greg would happily trade {album: Ten} for this tenth release. Nonetheless, {host: Greg} does find some interesting experimentation in {album: Lightning Bolt}, noticeably on songs like "{track: Pendulum}" and "{track: Yellow Moon}" which show enough growth in the band's sound to earn the record a Burn It. {host: Jim}, however, thinks those same tracks are some of the weakest with their misguided allusions to the {artist: U2} and {artist: Elton John} ballads. He prefers the faster pace of songs like "{track: Lightning Bolt}," which combined with a few others, might make for a decent EP. Therefore this LP gets a {tag: Burn It}.
