# Show 430: Deltron 3030 and Beck Review

![Deltron 3030](http://static.soundopinions.org/images/2014/deltron_web.jpg)

Jim and Greg welcome {genre: hip-hop} supergroup {artist: Deltron 3030}. {name: Dan "The Automator" Nakamura}, {name: Del the Funky Homosapien} and {name: Kid Koala} perform songs from {album: Event II}.  Later, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} review the new album from {artist: Beck}, and {host: Greg} drops a quarter in the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}.
 
## 00:02:14 News: 02.21.14
{name: Bob Casale}, a founding member of {genre: New Wave} group {artist: Devo}, died of heart failure earlier this week at age 61. Although singer {name: Mark Mothersbaugh} and Bob's brother {name: Jerry [Casale]} usually get credit for Devo's distinct sound, "{tag: Bob 2}" was there from the start, contributing keys, guitar, and vocals on all nine of the band's albums. Strange and sarcastic as those albums may be, Jim notes, they came from a sincere place: the band started as a much-needed creative outlet after its {place: Akron}, {place: Ohio}-based members witnessed the {tag: Kent State} shootings firsthand. Devo may not seem like a protest group, but their music was nevertheless a statement—one influenced heavily by Casale.

## 00:03:45 Interview: Deltron 3030
Welcome to the {era: 31st Century}: {place: Earth} is a wasteland ruled by roving gangs. Corporate greed, runaway technology and economic disparity have finally caught up with the planet. This dire, {genre: science fiction} scenario is anything but ordinary {genre: hip-hop}. And, that's not surprising considering how extra-ordinary {artist: Deltron 3030} is. This {tag: supergroup} is made up of {name: Dan "the Automator" Nakamura}, the man behind sounds by {artist: Gorillaz} and {name: Dr. Octagonecologyst}; {name: Del the Funky Homosapien}, an innovative {place: Oakland} MC who wrote lyrics for his cousin {name: Ice Cube}'s group {artist: Da Lench Mob}; and finally, turntable wizard {name: Kid Koala}. All three crossed paths during the making of other projects like {artist: Handsome Boy Modeling School} and {artist: Gorillaz}. And in {era: 2000}, with a futuristic comic-book inspiration, Deltron 3030 released its self-titled debut.
The world has changed a lot since then, and the sequel, {album: Event II}, presents a new idea of the future (one that made Greg's [Best of 2013](http://www.soundopinions.org/show/419) list) Del, Dan and Kid talk about their new, loftier goals for this album and how such dense, off-the-wall recordings get made. They also riff on everything from {tag: Transformers} to {name: David Byrne} to *{tag: 1984}*. 


## 00:45:10 Review: Beck 
![Morning Phase](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music4/v4/7a/54/04/7a540421-1e42-6832-fbcd-c4c2480e43ac/source/600x600bb.jpg "312095/797897966")
It has been nearly 8 years since {artist: Beck} released a new album, and there have been quite a few life changes in that time. He's married with a child, and has moved from {label: Interscope} records to {label: Capitol Records}. His new album, {album: Morning Phase}, is a contemplative, introspective slow-moving record, akin to his {genre: 2003} record {album: Sea Change}. Beck also makes this record a family affair by having his father, {name: David Campbell}, arranging many of the string sections on the record. {host: Greg} didn't enjoy the album initially, but grew to appreciate it by listening with headphones at night.   He gives it an enthusiastic {tag: Buy It}. {host: Jim}, on the other hand, thinks the material is slightly lacking substance lyrically and wishes {artist: Beck} had more to say. Still, the music arrangements are beautiful, and so he gives {album: Morning Phase} a {tag: Try It}.

## 00:51:37 DIJ: Greg
Musician {artist: Nick Waterhouse} recently told {host: Greg} that he's always trying to make his music "{genre: swing}." Except instead of swinging like {artist: Benny Goodman}, Waterhouse wanted to swing more like blues-guitarist {artist: Bobby Parker}. Specifically, Parker's {era: 1961} track, "{track: Watch Your Step}", which at the time of its release was a huge influence on everyone from {artist: The Spencer Davis Group}, to {artist: Carlos Santana}, to {artist: John Lennon}. Unfortunately for Parker, the general public wasn't nearly as smitten by the song, and it's since faded into obscurity. Greg managed to find a copy of this rare release, and now he's eager for Parker to earn the recognition his riffs deserve. You can hear "Watch Your Step's" inspiration on songs like {artist: The Beatles}' "{track: I Feel Fine}" and {artist: Led Zeppelin}'s "{track: Moby Dick}".
