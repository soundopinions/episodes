## 00:01:49 News: 1.18.2013
Hard to believe, but {artist: The Beatles} are so old that some of their music is now entering {tag: public domain} in {place: Europe}. While a law is in place to extend copyrights in the {tag: E.U.} from 50 to 70 years, that won't go into effect until {era: 2014}. That means that as of New Year's Eve 2012, early tracks like "{track: Love Me Do}" are up for grabs. Early tracks by {artist: Bob Dylan}, however, have recently been protected. In order to avoid its catalog going into public domain, {label: Sony Music} has taken advantage of the law's "use it or lose it" clause. They released a compilation aptly titled, {album: The 50th Anniversary Collection: The Copyright Extension Collection, Vol. 1.} It's only available in certain European countries though, so American Dylan fans will have to be willing to pay big bucks on {tag: eBay}.

This is typically the dry season for major album releases, but there have been a lot of buzzworthy singles. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} run through some of the big ones. They never thought they'd utter the words "new {artist: David Bowie} track," but we've got one called "{album: Where Are We Now}," with a {name: Tony Visconti}-{tag: produced} album to follow. Then there's {artist: JT}'s new chart-topper "{track: Suit and Tie}." A couple of weeks ago Jim and Greg made a plea for the gentleman of {artist: Outkast} to come back together, and now we have both {name: Big Boi} and {name: Andre 3000} appearing on a remix of {artist: Frank Ocean}'s "{track: Pink Matter}." But, Andre is quick to squash any reunion rumors. Last, but not least, are the ladies of {artist: Destiny's Child}. There's a new song called "{track: Nuclear}" and plans for the three to appear together during the {tag: Superbowl Halftime Show}. Guess motherhood has made {name: Beyonce} nostalgic.

## 00:08:55 List: Satirical Songs
Next week, {tag: South Park} and {tag: *Book of Mormon*} creators {name: Trey Parker} and {name: Matt Stone} join {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} in the studio to talk music and comedy. The duo's trademark musical {tag: satire} has won them tons of fans - and a few {tag: Tony awards}. In advance of the boys' visit, Jim and Greg warm up the crowd with a mix of {genre: rock n' roll}'s {tag: Best Satirical Songs}. Whether they're pointing a finger at society's ills or sending up {genre: pop} music forms, these artists turn the funny up to 11.

### Greg's Picks:
- {artist: Frank Zappa & The Mothers of Invention}, "{track: Who Needs the Peace Corps}?"
- {artist: Dead Kennedys}, "{track: Holiday in Cambodia}"
- {artist: Tim Fite}, "{track: I've Been Shot}"
- {artist: Digital Underground}, "{track: The Humpty Dance}"

### Jim's Picks
- {artist: Bill Cosby}, "{track: Hooray for the Salvation Army Band}!"
- {artist: Beck}, "{track: Debra}"
- {artist: Bongwater}, "{track: Free Love Messes Up My Life}"
- {artist: The Rutles}, "{track: Ouch}!"

## 00:49:02 Review: Yo La Tengo
![Fade](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/93/98/a3/9398a384-4562-1917-cb03-3d2dd3ffd807/source/600x600bb.jpg "2959228/579062959")

Indie veterans {artist: Yo La Tengo} started making their version of the {artist: Velvet Underground}'s droning guitar rock in 1984. Jim and Greg have been listening ever since. (Jim - our own "Son of Jersey" - even caught the band's first show at {place: Maxwell's} in {place: Hoboken}). Over 13 albums, Jim says, Yo La's established itself as a band of impeccable taste. Greg admits their last few contemplative mood records have sounded a bit "samey." Do they shake things up on the latest release, {album: Fade}? Both Greg and {host: Jim} say "yes." The strings and "{name: John Fahey}-esque" acoustic {tag: guitar} are pleasant surprises. As {host: Greg} notes, {name: Ira Kaplan} and {name: Georgia Hubley}'s ruminations on their decades-long relationship give {album: Fade} a cohesive feel. It gets a double {tag: Buy It}.
