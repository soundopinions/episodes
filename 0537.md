![time](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2016/clockweb.jpg)

Rock Around the Clock: Time to wind up those pocket watches and chronometers. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} take you on a fourth-dimensional voyage as they explore their favorite {tag: Songs About Time}. Then they review the second album from {tag: Grammy} winning rapper {artist: Kendrick Lamar}.


## 00:02:11 Intro: Music News
The man commonly referred to as "the fifth Beatle," Sir {name: George Martin}, died Tuesday at the age of 90. Martin, a producer, was originally known for bringing success to {tag: Parlophone Records} in the {era: 1950s} by producing comedy albums by such performers and {name: Peter Sellers}, {name: Peter Ustinov}, and {tag: The Goon Show} troupe. 

Then, in 1962, Martin met with an unknown band called {artist: The Beatles}. The group had been rejected by every label they had spoken to prior, and Martin, though not thoroughly impressed by their music, signed The Beatles to {label: Parlophone}. Luckily for them—and for the droves of Beatles fans-to-be—Martin had been seeking a new group to represent the {genre: rock 'n' roll} scene emerging from the {place: UK}, and he liked their sense of humor. He taught the novice, live band about recording and producing.Between 1962 and 1970, The Beatles produced 13 albums and 22 singles under Martin's guidance.  And though he went on to produce several big-name bands after that, Martin is most well-known for bringing The Beatles from obscurity to the forefront of popular music.
