## 00:01:52 List: Greg's Mixtape: A Curse I Cannot Lift

1. {artist : Lindsey Buckingham}, "{track : I Am Waiting}." A cover of a relatively obscure {artist : Rolling Stones} track from "{album : Aftermath}" sets the mood of sunrise expectation and apprehension. "I am waiting ... waiting for someone to come out of somewhere."
2. {artist : Midlake}, "{track : Roscoe}." An echo from Lindsey Buckingham's past? The sound is {era : mid-'70s}  {artist : Fleetwood Mac}: dusky {genre : folk-rock}. I can imagine {name : Christine McVie} doing a perfect cover of this song. The song is set in 1891, like a dream about a more innocent time.
3. {artist : The Decemberists}, "{track : The Crane Wife 3}." Still in the past, still dreaming, but the innocence turns to despair.
4. {artist : Dirty on Purpose}, "{track : Car No-Drive}." Wake up. Morning rush hour. This song sounds like it's pouring from the windows of a passing subway train. We're going somewhere...
5. {artist : Rhymefest}, "{track : Bullet}." To {place : Iraq}. Turn on the TV, and we see young recruits wondering how they ended up in a desert in the Middle East fighting a war they don't understand.
6. {artist : Serena-Maneesh}, "{track : Drain Cosmetics}." A sandstorm of guitars.
7. {artist : Secret Machines}, "{track : Lightning Blue Eyes}." Then tunneling out, and into the sunlight where "I felt awake, I was way out."
8. {artist : Parts and Labor}, "{track : A Great Divide}." A call to arms, a dividing line in the mix, day becomes night.
9. {artist : TV on the Radio}, "{track : Wolf Like Me}." Silhouettes dash against the moon -- "Got a curse I cannot lift."
10. {artist : The Roots}, "{track : In the Music}." A sinister night vibe, as low-riders slink through skyscraper canyons.
11. {artist : Nelly Furtado}, "{track : Maneater}." Where all sorts of nightcrawlers roam ...
12. {artist : Justin Timberlake}, "{track : What Goes Around/Comes Around}." And a reckoning goes down -- "I can't believe it's ending this way."
13. {artist : Van Hunt}, "{track : If I Take You Home}." The night winds down, uneasy partners match up...
14. {artist : Love is All}, "{track : Make Out Fall Out Make Up}." The hangover aftermath --"I think I'll spend all day in bed."
15. {artist : Gnarls Barkley}, "{track : Gone Daddy Gone}." "Love is gone away."
16. {artist : John Legend}, "{track : Show Me}." A morning prayer for guidance.
17. {artist : Beyoncé}, "{track : Irreplaceable}." And she's ready to move on, a new day begins...
