![Mann & Weil](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2016/mannweil_web.jpg)

What goes into writing a hit song? Sound Opinions takes a look at the world of professional {tag : songwriting}, from {artist : The Righteous Brothers} to {artist : Beyoncé}. {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} talk with legendary {tag : Brill Building} songwriters {name : Barry Mann} and {name : Cynthia Weil} about their decades long career. Then they talk with {name : Ryan Tedder} about penning songs for {artist : Adele} and {artist : Taylor Swift}. Plus, a review of the long-awaited new album from {artist : Frank Ocean}.



## 00:01:46 Interview: Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil

This week, Sound Opinions explores the art of songwriting. Jim and Greg talk to some of the biggest pop hitmakers of the past and present. First, a conversation with the legendary {tag : songwriting} duo {tag : Barry Mann} and {tag : Cynthia Weil}. The husband and wife team were part of the {tag : Brill Building} era of {era : 1960s}  {place : New York}, and worked alongside writing powerhouses like {tag : Gerry Goffin} and {artist : Carole King}, and collaborated with producer {tag : Phil Spector}. Mann and Weil wrote some of the biggest hits of all time, from "{track : You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'}" to "{track : On Broadway}" and even "{track : We Gotta Get Out of This Place}." In 2011, Mann and Weil received the {tag : Johnny Mercer Award} from the {tag : Songwriters Hall of Fame} and since 2013, have been depicted in the {tag : Tony Award}-winning musical {tag : *Beautiful: The Carole King Musical*} about the early life and career of their friend and coworker. In this interview, the duo tell Jim and Greg the origins of their famous hits, tell stories and reflect on what could have been had Barry released  "We Gotta Get Out of This Place"  before {artist : The Animals}.



## 00:30:23 Interview: Ryan Tedder

Next, Jim and Greg chat with performer and songwriter {artist : Ryan Tedder}. While Tedder is best known as the frontman of the {genre : pop rock} band {artist : OneRepublic}, he's also had an extremely successful career writing songs for other artists like {artist : Beyoncé}, {artist : Adele} and {artist : Taylor Swift}. Tedder began a struggling songwriter in Nashville, but eventually producer {artist : Timbaland} helped OneRepublic rise to popularity by remixing their song "{track : Apologize}" in 2007. Jim and Greg ask Tedder about how to write a great pop song and what it's like to work with Queen Bey. They also discuss the longevity of music today and whether the humanity in songwriting is lost.



## 00:44:45 Review: Frank Ocean

![Blonde](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/561/22L0.jpg)

Who doesn't love a surprise? {artist : Frank Ocean} surprised fans when he dropped not one but two albums without notice this past week. The {genre : R&B} singer broke out in 2012 with his album {album : Channel Orange} before essentially disappearing. Over the past few months he has hinted about new music and now he has finally delivered: a visual album called {album : Endless} and a more traditional album (as traditional as it can get) called {album : Blonde}. Was it worth the wait? {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} both say "yes." Jim finds that the low-key and moody *Blonde* takes on some weighty issues, addressing gender-fluidity and a feeling of disconnection from other humans at a time when technology has made communication "easier than ever." Greg says the album's production sounds like nothing else and "occupies its own universe." He says that love is the theme to the record – and while that might seem simple, Ocean takes the concept in complex and moving directions. It's an enthusiastic double {tag : Buy It}.



## 00:50:57 DIJ: Jim

Like much of the TV-watching public, Jim enjoyed binge-watching the {tag : Netflix} horror series "{tag : Stranger Things}." The show hearkens back to many pop cultural touchstones of the {era : '70s} and {era : '80s} – including in its music. Jim notes that the {tag : synth}-based score takes inspiration from the soundtrack work of the {place : German[y]} band {artist : Tangerine Dream}, a key act in the {genre : psychedelic}  {genre : krautrock} movement. Jim's favorite Tangerine Dream score is for the 1977 {name : William Friedkin} film {album : Sorcerer}. He says the soundtrack perfectly matches the movie's dark, tense jungle setting. So as a dual nod to *Stranger Things* and Tangerine Dream, Jim nominates "{track : Betrayal}," the main theme from *Sorcerer*, to the {tag : Desert Island Jukebox}.
