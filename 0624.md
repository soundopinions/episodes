Plus a review of the new album from eclectic Las Vegas singer-songwriter Shamir.

## 00:01:01 Interview: Ted Leo

This week, {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} are joined by singer-songwriter {artist : Ted Leo} in front of an audience at the {place : Goose Island Tap Room} in {place : Chicago}. Leo gained fame in the early attention with his tuneful yet political approach to punk rock with his band {artist : [Ted Leo and] the Pharmacists}. But it's been seven years since Leo's last album. In that time, he formed a successful collaboration with {artist : Aimee Mann} as {artist : The Both} (who were [Sound Opinions guests in 2014](/show/463/)). But his family also suffered emotional and financial crises, which inform his ambitious new album, {album : The Hanged Man}.

The album's expansive sound is the product of being able to tinker alone in his new home studio in {place : Rhode Island}. No longer on a label, Leo crowdfunded the album through {tag : Kickstarter} and released it himself. Ted Leo discusses how his personal turmoil affected his music and how his fanbase gave him a lift. He also gives an intimate solo performance of songs from {album : The Hanged Man}.



## 00:41:36 Review: Shamir

![Revelations](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/624/1XC0.jpg)

{genre : Singer-songwriter}Â  {artist : Shamir} is back with a new album called {album : Revelations}. While his debut {album : Ratchet} sported a lot of {genre : house} music and festival hooks, Revelations is a much more mid-fi effort that mixes genres like {genre : folk}, {genre : soul} and {genre : rock}. {host : Jim} finds the record to be a shocking departure but in a good way. Shamir is singing about what's on his mind: racism, sexism, gender, sexuality, etc. He articulates his thoughts wonderfully with a sonically interesting blend of musical styles. Jim is a fan of Revelations and gives it a {tag : Buy it}. {host : Greg} agrees, and loves that Shamir is asserting his independence and uniqueness as an artist. He also loves Shamir's allusions to other artists he admires, like the {artist : Ronettes} and the {artist : Pixies}. Greg finds this album to be inspired and interesting, and gives it a {tag : Buy It}.



## 00:48:51 DIJ: Jim

This week, {host : Jim} chose what he calls a "perfect {genre : power pop} gem" for his desert island jukebox pick. He selected {track : Flew a Falcon (Nut & Bolts Version)} by {artist : Richard Barone}. Barone was the frontman of {place : New Jersey} power pop band {artist : The Bongos}. Jim says Flew a Falcon is about a teen "realizing that there are incredible forces inside you, and you don't know what to do with them". The song is also a nostalgic pick that reminds him of his days sneaking into to the rock club {place : Maxwell'}s in {place : Hoboken} as an underage fan in the {genre : 1980s}.
