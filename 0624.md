## 00:01:01 Interview: Ted Leo
This week, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} are joined by singer-songwriter {artist: Ted Leo} in front of an audience at the {place: Goose Island Tap Room} in {place: Chicago}. Leo gained fame in the early attention with his tuneful yet political approach to punk rock with his band {artist: [Ted Leo and] the Pharmacists}. But it's been seven years since Leo's last album. In that time, he formed a successful collaboration with {artist: Aimee Mann} as {artist: The Both} (who were [Sound Opinions guests in 2014](http://soundopinions.org/show/463/)). But his family also suffered emotional and financial crises, which inform his ambitious new album, {album: The Hanged Man}.

The album's expansive sound is the product of being able to tinker alone in his new home studio in {place: Rhode Island}. No longer on a label, Leo crowdfunded the album through {tag: Kickstarter} and released it himself. Ted Leo discusses how his personal turmoil affected his music and how his fanbase gave him a lift. He also gives an intimate solo performance of songs from {album: The Hanged Man}.


## 00:41:36 Review: Shamir
![Revelations](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music128/v4/b7/4e/28/b74e2883-96a1-2482-d62f-9fbea07c2dd0/source/600x600bb.jpg "1245369957/1266752048")
{genre: Singer-songwriter} {artist: Shamir} is back with a new album called {album: Revelations}. While his debut {album: Ratchet} sported a lot of {genre: house} music and festival hooks, Revelations is a much more mid-fi effort that mixes genres like {genre: folk}, {genre: soul} and {genre: rock}. {host: Jim} finds the record to be a shocking departure but in a good way. Shamir is singing about what's on his mind: racism, sexism, gender, sexuality, etc. He articulates his thoughts wonderfully with a sonically interesting blend of musical styles. Jim is a fan of Revelations and gives it a {tag: Buy it}. {host: Greg} agrees, and loves that Shamir is asserting his independence and uniqueness as an artist. He also loves Shamir's allusions to other artists he admires, like the {artist: Ronettes} and the {artist: Pixies}. Greg finds this album to be inspired and interesting, and gives it a {tag: Buy It}.


## 00:48:51 DIJ: Jim 
   This week, {host: Jim} chose what he calls a "perfect {genre: power pop} gem" for his desert island jukebox pick. He selected {track: Flew a Falcon (Nut & Bolts Version)} by {artist: Richard Barone}. Barone was the frontman of {place: New Jersey} power pop band {artist: The Bongos}. Jim says Flew a Falcon is about a teen "realizing that there are incredible forces inside you, and you don't know what to do with them". The song is also a nostalgic pick that reminds him of his days sneaking into to the rock club {place: Maxwell'}s in {place: Hoboken} as an underage fan in the {genre: 1980s}.
