## 00:02:16 News: 1.31.14
Traditionally the {tag: Grammy Awards} honor commercial success more than critical. So it was refreshing to see {artist: Daft Punk} take home so many prizes, including the two biggest: [*Album of the Year*](http://www.grammy.com/videos/daft-punk-win-album-of-the-year) and *Record of the Year*. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} were also pleased with the live [performance](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/daft-punk-stevie-wonder-pharrell-674151) featuring the French robots with {name: Nile Rodgers}, {name: Stevie Wonder}, {name: Pharrell Williams}, {name: Omar Hakim} and {name: Nathan East} (Usually the televised ceremony's odd couple pairings are nothing more than stunts). The last {genre: dance} music album to win the top prize was {album: *Saturday Night Fever*} in {era: 1979}. Jim and Greg hope they don't have to wait another two decades for more {era: EDM} {tag: Grammy} wins. 

At 94, {artist: Pete Seeger} lived long enough to know that his music inspired multiple generations. Greg describes him as a working-class advocate who delivered the news through song. And sometimes that news was met with controversy, as with his performance of "{track: Waist Deep in the Big Muddy}" on {tag: *The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour*}, attempted unsuccessfully in {era: 1967} and then again in {era: 1968}. Jim and Greg play a recorded version of that song in honor of Seeger, who died January 27 of natural causes.

## 00:08:24 Interview: The Dismemberment Plan
Like its peers {artist: Death Cab for Cutie} & {artist: The Shins} the {place: Washinton D.C.} band {artist: The Dismemberment Plan} was on its way to major success in the early part of the new millenium, and then in 2003, decided to pack it in. Bassist {name: Eric Axelson}, guitarist {name: Jason Caddell}, drummer {name: Joe Easley} and singer {name: Travis Morrison} went in different directions (Easly at {tag: N.A.S.A.}!), but more than a decade later the D-Plan is back with {album: Uncanny Valley}. They talked with {host: Greg} about their multiple musical influences, including {genre: punk rock}, {genre: hip-hop} & {place: [Washington] D.C.}'s {genre: Go-Go} scene. Lead singer {name: Travis Morrison} says that ultimately the band is still figuring it out, much like [Ferris Bueller](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATkUqWssSGc) did.

## 00:48:53 Review: Broken Bells
![After the Disco](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5c/After_The_Disco_Cover.jpg "345658567/734744722")
The term {tag: supergroup} is often overused, but the duo {artist: Broken Bells} might fit the bill. {artist: The Shins}' {name: James Mercer} and producer {name: Brian Burton}, a.k.a. {artist: Danger Mouse} came together for a 2010 self-titled debut. Now they're back for round two with {album: After the Disco}. {host: Greg} enjoys its chilled moodiness, noting Mercer and Burton's skill at layering complex and beautiful melodies. But, the effect eventually begins to wear thin, so Greg can only say {tag: Try It}. {host: Jim} thinks Greg is being too harsh and argues the record is more soulful than chilled. Mercer's strong vocals paired with Burton's crisp yet dark sound creates a sustained mood throughout that's introspective and worth repeat listenings. Jim says {tag: Buy It}.
