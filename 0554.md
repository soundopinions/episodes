## 00:01:45 Interview: Savages

You'd be hard-pressed to find a more emotionally and sonically intense album out right now than {artist: Savages}' sophomore effort, {album: Adore Life}. In fact, that record ranks high in both {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}'s [{tag: Best Albums of 2016...So Far}](http://soundopinions.org/show/553) lists. The {place: London}-based quartet's first record, {album: Silence Yourself}, perfectly channeled their anger and frustration at the world via good old-fashioned {genre: art punk}. On *Adore Life*, they tackle the frequent topic of love in a fresh, fearless, and powerful way. The band was a [guest on Sound Opinions back in 2013](http://soundopinions.org/show/409/#savages), so it was a pleasure to welcome then again for an interview and live performance.

## 00:40:51 Review: Maxwell
![blackSUMMERS'night](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music18/v4/f1/2d/8e/f12d8e6a-00c8-3c10-67aa-1ce8c72cf2f5/source/600x600bb.jpg "486768/1118454775")
   {genre: Neo soul} artist {artist: Maxwell} does things his own way and on his own schedule. Over his twenty year career he has put out five albums, sometimes with long periods of time between them.  In 2009 he released *BLACKsummers'night* and announced it as the first of a trilogy. Seven years later, he has finally released part two of that series with the confusingly similar title {album: blackSUMMERS'night}. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} both say Maxwell's sensitive style on this album is well worth the wait. Greg notes that Maxwell bucks the {genre: R&B} trend of loading up on guest appearances and star producers. Instead he does it on his own and creates a sound that is unique and complex. And that complexity carries through to the album's "bedroom jams" adding a level of "lyrical density" to the genre. Jim hears echoes of {artist: Prince} on the album as "gender gets lost in the mix" and notes an overarching respect for love and relationships. {album: blackSUMMERS'night} gets a double {tag: Buy It}. 

## 00:48:48 Review: DJ Shadow
![The Mountain Will Fall](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music49/v4/2a/68/dc/2a68dc4b-9036-4d60-c8d9-9034958a3d06/source/600x600bb.jpg "133086/1100742453")
{artist: DJ Shadow} emerged in the {era: early '90s} as a major figure in the {place: northern California} underground {genre: hip-hop} scene. His debut 1996 full-length {album: Endtroducing.....} was one of the earliest and greatest of {tag: sample-based} albums. But when you make a masterpiece your first time out, where do you go from there? His latest album {album: The Mountain Will Fall} features fewer samples, more synths, and more collaborations – notably with {genre: rap} luminaries {artist: Run the Jewels}. {host: Jim} says the album is not an easy listen – there are tracks that seem frivolous or intentially grating. But after spending time with it, he finds the record a great soundtrack for ominous times and calls it a {tag: Buy It}. {host: Greg} appreciates that DJ Shadow never repeats himself. Instead he's nodding to contemporary {genre: EDM}, {genre: Italian classical music}, and old school hip-hop and {genre: turntablism}. Greg calls {album: The Mountain Will Fall} a fine record that isn't as cohesive as {album: Endtroducing.....}, but still worthy of a {tag: Try It}.
