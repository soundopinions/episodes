## 00:31:30 List: {tag: Dad Rock}, Meet {tag: Dad Rap}
![Kendrick Lamar and Bruce Springsteen](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2018/kendrickbruce.jpg)Though it began as a put-down, the term {genre: Dad Rock} has grown into almost a term of endearment, said Uproxx Cultural Critic {name: Steven Hyden}. He delved deep into {tag: Dad Rock} in his book, [{tag: Twilight of The Gods}](https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062657121/twilight-of-the-gods/), and took the idea a step further in [a piece for Uproxx](https://uproxx.com/music/dad-rap-dad-rock-conversion-guide/). There he posited that certain {genre: hip hop} artists could be grouped together as {genre: Dad Rap} and provided a tongue-in-cheek conversion guide. Hyden joined {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} to debate his comparisons and come up with some new ones. 

### Here's who they compare:
