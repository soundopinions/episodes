# Show 699: Moby, Opinions on Nico Segal's Intellexual

![Moby](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2019/moby1.jpg)

{artist : Moby} became the face of {genre : techno} with the blockbuster success of his 1999 album {album : Play}. He's since made several successful albums and put out his first memoir, *{tag : Porcelain}*, in 2016. Jim and Greg revisit their 2016 conversation with Moby in honor of his latest memoir, *{tag : Then It Fell Apart}*. They also review the debut album from the group {artist : Intellexual}, made up of frequent {artist : Chance the Rapper} collaborators Nico Segal and Nate Fox.



## 00:01:27 Interview: Moby

{artist : Moby} – who [first appeared on the show in 2006](/show/49/) – arrived in {place : New York City} in the {era : late '80s} as a sober Christian {tag : vegan} making his way through the nascent underground {genre : club} scene. A decade later, he was the public face of {genre : techno}, selling 10 million copies of his album {album : Play} and living a life of excess. He wrote all about his early career in his first memoir {tag : *Porcelain*}, a book [{host : Jim} compared to {artist : Charles Mingus}'s *{tag : Beneath the Underdog}*](https://www.wbez.org/shows/jim-derogatis/mobys-porcelain-is-a-musical-memoir-that-ranks-with-the-very-best/67afc360-5db1-48ff-ac29-db5813e69e01) as one of the great musical autobiographies. Now his second memoir, {tag : *Then It Fell Apart*} is due out soon.

This week Moby speaks with Jim and {host : Greg} about the gritty but exuberant heyday of {genre : rave} culture and {genre : house} music – and how quickly it all ended. After a string of club hits, Moby confused some critics with the eclectic 1995 album {album : Everything is Wrong}, and alienated just about everybody with the {genre : hardcore punk}-inspired {album : Animal Rights} in 1996. But 1999's {album : Play} was an unprecedented smash, which led, as Moby explains, to the traditional rise-and-fall story arc of fame and decadence.



## 00:39:00 Review: Intellexual

![Intellexual](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/699/1T00.jpg)

This week, {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} review {album : Intellexual}, a project from {artist : Nate Fox} and {artist : Nico Segal}. The duo, who are also a part of {artist : The Social Experiment}, came up in the collaborative {place : Chicago}-based scene that nurtured {artist : Chance The Rapper}, and have worked with {genre : hip hop} artists like {artist : Kanye West} and {artist : Frank Ocean}. This project, however, finds Nate and Nico attempting a {genre : singer-songwriter} vibe a'la {artist : Carly Simon} and {artist : James Taylor}. Greg thinks that {artist : Intellexual} is a project that defies genre categorization: in just one track ("{track : Popstar}") they employ {genre : footwork}  {genre : electronic} sounds, {genre : classical} strings, and {genre : jazz} trumpet. It's a debut that Jim calls a multi-hyphenate "complete joyride."



## 00:46:00 DIJ: Greg

This week, {host : Greg} is taking a trip to put a quarter in the {tag : desert island jukebox} and play a song he can't live without! In March of 2019, the singer and songwriter {artist : Scott Walker} died at age 76. Recently, Greg spoke with members of the {genre : experimental metal} band {artist : Sunn 0)))} who reflected on their unusual collaboration with Walker, who began his career doing {genre : blue-eyed soul} and somehow towards the end did a song that mentioned both Elvis's twin and 9/11. Greg chose the song "{track : The Seventh Seal}" off Walker's 1969 album {album : Scott 4}. The song is a reference to the 1957 Ingmar Bergman film of the same name. It deals with a knight who gets in a chess match with Death and unfortunately doesn't come out on top.
