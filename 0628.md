![Lester Bangs](https://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2017/lesterbangs_web.jpg)

{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} indulge this week in a deep look at their own profession: {tag: rock criticism}. They're joined by novelist {name: Jonathan Lethem}, co-editor of a new anthology of rock criticism, who makes the case for music journalism as great American writing. Plus, they look at the life and career of legendary critic {name: Lester Bangs} and review new albums from Chicago gospel legend {artist: Mavis Staples} and Icelandic multimedia artist {artist: Björk}.


## 00:01:25 Interview: Jonathan Lethem
This week, Jim and Greg take a close look at a topic very close to their hearts: {tag: rock criticism}. They talk to author {name: Jonathan Lethem} to make the case for rock journalism as great American writing. Lethem is an award-winning novelist and MacArthur Genius grant recipient. Along with {name: Kevin Detmar}, Lethem co-edited an anthology of rock criticism called {tag: *Shake It Up: Great American Writing on Rock and Pop from Elvis to Jay-Z*}. 

{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} also discuss the life and impact of {tag: Lester Bangs}, one rock critic who, in many ways, made Jim the critic he is today. We also get a glimpse of some of the critics that deeply influenced Greg, from {tag: Greil Marcus} to {tag: Nelson George}.

## 00:40:39 Review: Mavis Staples
![If All I Was Was Black](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music118/v4/1c/cf/c4/1ccfc4c3-bdf9-a631-7293-b4050dff5da2/source/600x600bb.jpg "49985/1277133591")
{artist: Mavis Staples} is a national treasure and {genre: gospel} legend, but has only recently blossomed into a successful solo artist. She recently released {album: If All I Was Was Black}, a record she collaborated on with {artist: Wilco} frontman {artist: Jeff Tweedy}. {host: Greg}, [who literally wrote the book on Mavis](https://www.amazon.com/Ill-Take-You-There-Freedoms/dp/1451647859), is loving this new record. He loves that Mavis is getting mad and speaking out against racial injustices in the United States in her most political album yet. He also loves Tweedy's guitar and arrangements on the record, as they give Mavis room to improvise and shine. He gives it an enthusiastic {tag: Buy It}. {host: Jim} couldn't agree more, and he points out that while Mavis is certainly more angry on this album, she shows through her lyrics and singing that she still has her tender, golden heart. Jim thinks this is the best record of Mavis's career on the {label: Anti-} label and her strongest collaboration with Tweedy. Jim gives If All I Was Was Black a {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:47:40 Review: Björk
![Utopia](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music118/v4/39/79/0e/39790e5b-fbec-4d89-a360-bfc9750731f3/source/600x600bb.jpg "295015/1301580609")
{artist: Björk} has been on top of the world of pop and {genre: experimental} music for decades, yet she's still regarded as an independent, {genre: avant-garde}, cult artist. But {host: Jim} says that her new album, {album: Utopia}, gave him no joy for the first time in her career. He calls her collaboration with {place: Venezuela}n {genre: electronic} artist {name: Arca} a collection of tuneless, wandering dirges filled with flutes and bird sounds. Although he's always loved Björk, Jim says the album is a {tag: Trash It}. {host: Greg} concedes that {album: Utopia} is hard to pin down and lacks the {genre: pop} accessibility of her previous work. But he gets lost in Björk's world, a combination of avant-garde {genre: classical} influences that evokes the soundscapes of the {place: Iceland}ic wilderness. Greg cites her recent albums in this vein as the inspiration for a new generation of artists like {artist: FKA Twigs} and {artist: Solange}. It took him a while to figure it out, but Greg feels {album: Utopia} is a {tag: Buy It}.
