![Julie Klausner](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2017/julieklausner_web.jpg)

As creator, writer, and star of the critically acclaimed TV comedy {album: Difficult People}, {artist: Julie Klausner} not only crafts the show's jokes but also guides its soundtrack. This week, she joins {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} for a hilarious discussion of the show's music and her own musical tastes, and she even attempts to win them over to {genre: musical theatre}. Plus, Jim and Greg review a new album from {artist: Beck} and a collaboration between {artist: Courtney Barnett} and {artist: Kurt Vile}.


## 00:01:46 Review: Beck
![Colors](//static.soundopinions.org/assets/621/2Y0.jpg "312095/1273064244")
{artist: Beck} won a surprise late career {tag: Album of the Year} {tag: Grammy} for his 2014 record {album: Morning Phase}. Now, he's back with his 13th album, {album: Colors}, co-produced by {artist: Adele} and {artist: Kelly Clarkson} collaborator {name: Greg Kurstin}. Although Beck constantly reinvented himself in the 1990s, {host: Greg} says that here, he's simply recycling his greatest pop moves of the past. Greg acknowledges that he still knows a great hook and continues to mix and match genres. Because it's so cheerful in comparison to the melancholy {album: Morning Phase}, Greg finds it difficult to dislike, but it still only merits a {tag: Try It}. {host: Jim}, however, finds it a big improvement over the last record. While Beck isn't reinventing the wheel, he's having fun with pastiches to {artist: The Police}, {artist: Elliott Smith}, and more. According to Jim, these songs are as good as any he's ever given us. He says {album: Colors} is a great party record and a {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:07:32 Review: Courtney Barnett and Kurt Vile

Both Jim and Greg are fans of {artist: Courtney Barnett and Kurt Vile}. {artist: Kurt Vile} has been on the scene for years, and was a founder of {artist: The War on Drugs}. {artist: Courtney Barnett} dropped her well-received debut {album: Sometimes I Sit and Think, and Sometimes I Just Sit} in 2015. 
Both Courtney and Kurt have been guests on Sound Opinions (separately). But that doesn't mean that {album: Lotta Sea Lice} (their collaborative album) would be an automatic slam dunk. However, to Jim, the album is like "chocolate and the peanut butter comes together, and they're even better than they are on their own." Greg agrees, adding that "it's like an electric campfire record... it's two mutual admirers... plugging in the amps... [and playing] intimate yet casual guitar." For {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} it's a double {tag: Buy It}.


## 00:16:52 Interview: Julie Klausner
![Julie Klausner](//static.soundopinions.org/assets/621/S40.jpg)
Our guest this week is writer, comedian and actress {name: Julie Klausner}. Julie is the creator and star of Hulu's snarky comedy {tag: *Difficult People*}. Klausner hails from {place: New York City} and grew up listening to heavy doses of both {genre: rock and roll} and {genre: musical theatre}. She also attended NYU where she was a first person observer of the exploding {genre: early 2000s} rock scene which featured bands like {artist: The Strokes} and {artist: TV on the Radio}, and she later wrote a book about her experiences with people in the music industry. Julie has gone on to create and star in *Difficult People*, a comedy about two best friends pursuing careers in the entertainment industry in NYC with varying degrees of success. Julie talks with Jim and Greg about how she uses music in her show, her surprising love of {artist: Jethro Tull} and tries to convince {host: Jim} that musicals are not always Trash Its. 


## 00:50:54 DIJ: Greg
This week, {host: Greg} takes us to the Desert Island and chooses a classic deep {genre: soul} record for the jukebox by {artist: O.V. Wright}. Though the {place: Memphis} vocalist never achieved mainstream success in his short life, Greg thinks he is one of the "greatest soul singers of all time."

O.V. Wright had a "lot of experiences with heartache and disappointment" according to Greg. Those experiences helped color his work, including his excellent album {album: Memphis Unlimited}, released in 1973. Produced by {name: Willie Mitchell} (who most famously worked with {artist: Al Green}), the album features Greg's {tag: desert island jukebox} pick "{track: He's My Son (Just the Same)}". The song is about a man who came out of prison to find his wife had a child by his own brother. The anguish and the forgiveness communicated through O.V. Wright's performance is "heartbreaking and beautiful."
