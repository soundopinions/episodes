## 00:05:46 News: 01.23.09
A number of {tag: free agents} are popping up in 2009 including {artist: 50 Cent}, {artist: Beck}, {artist: Ryan Adams}, {artist: Pearl Jam} and {artist: Metallica}. These music heavyweights have been on label rosters for years, but now, following in the footsteps of bands like {artist: Radiohead}, it appears they have a shot at going out on their own. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} agree that none of these artists actually need a record label. But, Greg points out that many might be tempted by {tag: 360 deals} similar to what {artist: Madonna} and {artist: Jay-Z} have with {tag: Live Nation}. The money's not in record sales anymore, so if major labels can entice an artist with the promise of profits from touring and merchandise, we may not see as much independence.

## 00:08:36 Interview: The Hold Steady
{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} welcome {artist: The Hold Steady} this week. The {place: Minneapolis} born, {place: Brooklyn} bred band are on tour to promote their 2008 album {album: Stay Positive}. Our hosts talk to lead singer {name: Craig Finn}, guitarist {name: Tad Kubler} and keyboardist & accordionist {name: Franz Nicolay} about their "meat and potatoes" style of {tag: rock} and roll. Greg notes that comparisons are often made to {artist: Bruce Springsteen}, but the band also cites {artist: Nick Cave} and {artist: Bob Dylan} as influences. Jim explains to the band that he was not immediately a Hold Steady fan, and was only converted after seeing them live. Craig, Tad and Franz explain that they are happy to convert him. That, of course, is the power of rock.

## 00:41:27 Review: Bruce Springsteen
![Working On a Dream](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/08/5f/6c/085f6c7d-b156-930b-4ede-6b8f4ca4daba/source/600x600bb.jpg "178834/404071615")
{artist: Bruce Springsteen} has released his 16th album called {album: Working on a Dream}. Debates about {tag: The Boss} are notorious on Sound Opinions, but with each new album the slate is wiped clean. So has this record made {host: Jim} a convert? Not exactly. He hates the half of the album that contains one warm and fuzzy, inspirational song after the next. And he hates the other half, full of monumentally failed experiments, even more. Jim gives Bruce a {tag: Trash It}, and that's no surprise to our listeners. What is a surprise is {host: Greg}'s take. He is, for the most part, a Springsteen appreciator. But, he isn't hearing great songwriting on {album: Working on a Dream}. Musically, it's okay, but lyrically, it's disappointing. Greg gives the album a {tag: Try It}.

## 00:49:13 Review: Andrew Bird
![Noble Beast](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music69/v4/e1/1e/d7/e11ed78d-2d1b-514d-aa08-a225f88eea7a/source/600x600bb.jpg "3883114/1074127634")

The next album up for review is by fellow American songwriter {artist: Andrew Bird}. Bird has a new album out called {album: Noble Beast}. In addition to writing songs, Bird tackles singing, violin playing and even whistlingâ€“an odd, but winning combo that has brought the musician flocks of fans. Greg thinks this fifth album has a more mainstream-friendly sound because of its strong melodies. But, he has a problem with the loss of momentum at the end of the album. For {host: Greg}, Bird lost steam by the last third, so he can only give {album: Noble Beast} a {tag: Try It}. {host: Jim} can't even go that far. He was bothered by the obtuse wordiness of the lyrics, and couldn't locate any emotional core in the songs. Jim gives Andrew Bird's release a {tag: Trash It}.
