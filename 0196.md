## 00:02:02 News: 08.28.09
Headlines regarding the death of {genre: pop} star {artist: Michael Jackson} continue to pour in. This week the AP reported that Jackson's {tag: death} was being ruled a homicide by the coroner's office. No official statement has been released, but it's likely that Jackson's physician will be charged with criminal negligence for administering the singer's drug cocktails. And while one camp investigates Jackson's death, another markets his life. A deal between promoter {tag: AEG} and Jackson's estate has been approved to exhibit the King of Pop's memorabilia. This October exhibition will coincide with the release of a behind-the-scenes film and will help AEG to recoup losses incurred following the cancellation of Jackson's massive comeback tour. Not to be left out, the remaining Jackson brothers are getting in on the action. They've announced plans for an {tag: A&E} reality show.

Despite pleas from Mom to turn that racket down, a new study says that music is actually good for your hearing. {tag: Northwestern University} neuroscientists have found evidence that musicians can pick speech out of a noisy environment better than non-musicians. This is good news for {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}, and any Sound Opinions listeners who find themselves struggling to hear in a crowded room.

Tenor {name: Johnny Carter} passed away this week at age 75. Carter was a member of both {artist: The Flamingos} and {artist: The Dells}, two of the most important {genre: doo-wop} groups of the '50s and '60s. To mark his passing Jim and Greg play a song and performed by Carter: "{track: Golden Teardrops}" by {artist: The Flamingos}.

## 00:11:56 Interview: She & Him
This week's guests are {artist: She & Him}. The "she" is actress {name: Zooey Deschanel} and the "him" is musician {name: Matt Ward}, known to fans as {artist: M. Ward}. The two met during the making of the movie "The Go-Getter," and quickly learned they were successful collaborators. They visited the show in {era: 2008} after the release of their first album {album: Volume One}. The record is a collection of songs written by Zooey, as well as a couple of covers. Zooey explains that she's most influenced by classic {genre: pop} songwriting, much of which pre-dates {genre: rock 'n' roll}. You can hear the {genre: country}, {genre: doo-wop} and {tag: Brill Building} influence on the duo's music as they perform their songs "{track: Take It Back}" and "{track: You've Really Got a Hold on Me}" as well as two bonus tracks.

## 00:39:44 Review: Whitney Houston
![I Look to You](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music5/v4/ff/18/17/ff1817d2-c7d4-055d-ca61-1765f1ca97b5/source/600x600bb.jpg "13952/328256728")

She was the queen of {genre: pop} in the {era: '80s} and {era: '90s}, but for the past few years she's mostly been a punchline. Now {artist: Whitney Houston} is back with a new record called {album: I Look To You}. {name: Clive Davis} has spared no expense on this comeback effort-pulling in big names like {artist: Swizz Beats}, {artist: Alicia Keys} and {artist: Diane Warren}. Greg wishes those big names brought something bigger to the table. With the exception of "{track: Million Dollar Bill}," the one track where Greg hears Whitney getting "frisky," she's mostly straight-jacketed and robotic. {host: Greg} gives the album a {tag: Trash It}. {host: Jim} actually likes that the production keeps things focused on her voice. And he finds that voice still powerful and full of emotion. He gives *I Look to You* a {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:47:48 Review: Arctic Monkeys
![Humbug](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/80/82/c0/8082c0d5-6168-72b4-6a4b-38a4c7758d37/source/600x600bb.jpg "62820413/335649043")
{artist: Arctic Monkeys} also have a new album out called {album: Humbug}. For their 3rd release the {place: UK} band traveled to the {place: California} desert to work with {name: Josh Homme} of {artist: Queens of the Stone Age} (and now {artist: Them Crooked Vultures}) fame. {host: Jim} loves the result. It has all of the charm and wit of their breakout debut, but with a dark ambience inspired by {name: Nick Cave} or {name: Scott Walker}. He gives the record a {tag: Buy It} rating. {host: Greg} applauds them for trying to change the pace with this release, but he doesn't think the songwriting is as strong. To Greg the melodies and exuberance have been replaced with texture and ambience. He gives Humbug a {tag: Try It}.
