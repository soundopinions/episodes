# Show 150: Oliver Sacks & Opinions on TV on the Radio, T.I., and Oasis
"{tag: Awakenings}" neurologist {name:  Oliver Sacks} joins {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} for an enlightening discussion about the powerful connection between music and the brain. And later the critics rate new albums from {artist: TV on the Radio} and {artist: Oasis}.

## 00:01:45 News: 10.10.08
The music industry's transition into a digital economy has not been the smoothest. But, in {place: England}, artists are banding together to make sure their voices will be heard in this revolution. British musicians including {artist: Radiohead}, {artist: Billy Bragg} and {artist: Robbie Williams} have formed the {tag: Featured Artists' Coalition} to insure that they can maintain the rights to their music and have more say about distribution in the future. Artists have traditionally been "abused" by big music corporations, and {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} think the changing landscape of music gives musicians the perfect opportunity to get more rights. Hopefully musicians in the States can follow suit.

Filmgoers are eagerly anticipating the release of the next {tag: James Bond} film. For now they'll have to settle for the new opening theme recorded by {artist: Jack White} and {artist: Alicia Keys}. Traditionally each Bond movie is accompanied by an original song, making it one of the biggest song franchises in history. Some were hits, and others were big misses. Neither Jim nor Greg think that the White/Keys collaboration ranks up there with great Bond tracks like "{track: Goldfinger}", "{track: Nobody Does it Better}", or "{track: You Only Live Twice}". They'd put it in the "misses" category with "{track: The Living Daylights}".

## 00:10:09 Interview: Oliver Sacks
As critics {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} have always suspected that music affects your brain, but they needed an expert to confirm their hypothesis. This week they speak with {name: Dr. Oliver Sacks}, author of the book *{tag: Awakenings}*, which later went on to become a film starring Robin Williams. His new book *{tag: Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain}* is a collection of anecdotes illustrating the powerful effects music can have on the brain. Sacks relays his clinical experiences working with a range of patients including individuals who struggle to connect with music's melody, Parkinsonian patients who depend on music's rhythm, and {tag: Alzheimer's} patients who find comfort in music's emotion. These people use music as a lifeline and a way to connect to the worldâ€“something rock fans certainly understand.

## 00:31:59 Review: Oasis
![Dig Out Your Soul](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music91/v4/6d/ea/30/6dea3009-25b9-3b7b-c31b-b2fbaebeea2c/source/600x600bb.jpg "512633/1196089572")

With their first two records {artist: Oasis} re-invigorated the British {genre: pop} world. Now they are back with number seven. Jim thinks that now it's time for {artist: Noel [Gallagher]} and {artist: Liam Gallagher} to consider a career change. Perhaps stand-up comedy? He finds {album: Dig Out Your Soul} laughable, especially the pace. If Noel had picked up more of the slack the album might have been more successful, but {host: Jim} has to deem it a {tag: Trash It}. {host: Greg} actually grew to be a fan of Oasis' earlier work, but he agrees with Jim on this one. He admits that they shamelessly rip off {artist: The Beatles}, but that's the least of the Gallaghers' problems. *Dig Out Your Soul* is merely a third rate rip off, and the lyrics are even worse. So Liam and Noel get two Trash Its.

## 00:42:00 Review: T.I.
![Paper Trail (Deluxe Version)](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/8b/e1/97/8be1971d-f4f8-26d6-0cbe-3f6dc47b02d7/source/600x600bb.jpg "14967/291279841")

{artist: T.I.} went straight to #1 this week with his new record {album: Paper Trail}. Unfortunately that's not the only headline the rapper has made. In a few months he's scheduled to serve a year long prison sentence for gun possession. But, as {host: Greg} points out, that should've made for great fodder for songwriting - should've being the operative word. He sees *Paper Trail* as a missed opportunity to do something deeper. Rather, this is T.I.'s most commercial record. It's packed with a handful of terrific tracks, but not enough to warrant a Buy It from Greg. {host: Jim} agrees; He enjoyed the hook-filled songs, but was left wanting more out of T.I. He recommends the rapper use his time away to channel his more poetic inspiration - {artist: Tupac Shakur}. Therefore the album gets two {tag: Try It}s.

## 00:48:43 Review: TV on the Radio
![Dear Science (Bonus Track Version)](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/8c/71/09/8c7109b7-1d07-d618-3510-2f44c1dc0953/source/600x600bb.jpg "6562624/291184215")

The final album up for review is by {place: Brooklyn} indie band {artist: TV on the Radio}. Now on major label {label: Interscope}, they've become one of the most talked about groups. Greg even put their last album in the #1 slot on his [Best of 2007](/show/107) list. {host: Jim} was not as big a fan of that record, but admits this one is stronger. They have success with their up-tempo tracks, but Jim becomes skeptical when the group slows down. He thinks they set their horizons a little too wide, and gives {album: Dear Science} a {tag: Try It}. {host: Greg} is more positive. {album: Return to Cookie Mountain} was like a soundtrack to such a dark period in the world. With *Dear Science*, he can almost hear the clouds parting. The album is "weirdly optimistic" to Greg and deserves a {tag: Buy It}.
