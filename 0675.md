![robyn](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/675/300.jpg)

{genre : Swedish pop} singer {artist : Robyn} has returned after an eight year hiatus with her new album, {album : Honey}. Her previous three records ({album : Body Talk Pt. 1}, {album : Body Talk Pt. 2} and {album : Body Talk}) established her dominance in the pop music scene with jams like "{track : Dancing On My Own}" and "{track : Call Your Girlfriend}." {host : Greg} notes that Robyn's forte is writing moving and sad songs to a beat that's melodic and danceable as heck! He says she's hitting her stride with this record. {host : Jim} is also glad she's back, and points out that this record goes well with the rest of the show about {tag : protest music} because it demonstrates that club songs can be introspective and meaningful too. He thinks that *Honey*, this vibrant, bittersweet record, is just right for {era : 2018}.

{host : Greg} takes us back to the {tag : desert island} with a selection by an artist that {artist : Jimmy Page} recently cited as an inspiration for the founding of {artist : Led Zeppelin}: pioneering rocker {artist : Bo Diddley}.
