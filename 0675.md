{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} discuss the impact of {tag: protest music} in the 21st century and name a few of their favorite tracks from the genre from the last 18 years.

## 00:01:48 Review: Robyn
![robyn](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/675/300.jpg)
{genre: Swedish pop} singer {artist: Robyn} has returned after an eight year hiatus with her new album, {album: Honey}. Her previous three records ({album: Body Talk Pt. 1}, {album: Body Talk Pt. 2} and {album: Body Talk}) established her dominance in the pop music scene with jams like "{track: Dancing On My Own}" and "{track: Call Your Girlfriend}." {host: Greg} notes that Robyn's forte is writing moving and sad songs to a beat that's melodic and danceable as heck! He says she's hitting her stride with this record. {host: Jim} is also glad she's back, and points out that this record goes well with the rest of the show about {tag: protest music} because it demonstrates that club songs can be introspective and meaningful too. He thinks that *Honey*, this vibrant, bittersweet record, is just right for {era: 2018}.

## 00:47:30 DIJ: Greg

{host: Greg} takes us back to the {tag: desert island} with a selection by an artist that {artist: Jimmy Page} recently cited as an inspiration for the founding of {artist: Led Zeppelin}: pioneering rocker {artist: Bo Diddley}. Bo Diddley introduced the {tag: hambone} beat to {genre: rock}, which later became known as the {tag: Bo Diddley beat} - a rhythm with {tag: Afro-Carribean} roots. His signature sound and swagger are clear on Greg's pick, "{track: Who Do You Love}." While Led Zeppelin's debut celebrated its 50th anniversary this year, Bo Diddley's self-titled debut album celebrates its 60th anniversary.
