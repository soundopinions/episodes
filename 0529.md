Although passing away at the age of 69 seems early by today's standards, it's what music innovator {tag: David Bowie} did with those 69 years that is significant. Bowie died after an 18-month battle with {tag: cancer} on January 10th. He was responsible for creating magical personas, from {tag: Ziggy Stardust} to {tag: Aladdin Sane} to the {tag: Thin White Duke}. Bowie released more than two-dozen albums exploring the genres of {genre: glam rock}, {genre: dance}, {genre: electronic} and even {genre: jazz}. Along with many of his solo hits, he participated in many memorable duets alongside artists like {artist: Mick Jagger}, {artist: Tina Turner} and {artist: Queen}. He earned a considerable amount of success in the art world and as an actor in films like {tag: *Labyrinth*} and {tag: *The Prestige*}. His freedom of expression in his music, art and sexuality opened people's minds and inspired countless artists. David left behind a son (filmmaker {tag: Duncan Jones}), his wife of 24 years (the supermodel {tag: Iman}) and their daughter Alexandria. In this show, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} discuss David Bowie's legacy and offer highlights from his long career. Producers and long time Bowie collaborators {artist: Brian Eno} and {name: Tony Visconti} also share their memories of the pop chameleon.

![Blackstar](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/529/2C80.jpg)

When music icon {artist: David Bowie} released the album {album: Blackstar} on his 69th birthday, only he and a handful of others knew it would be his last. With his passing, the dark and dramatic album took on new meaning. {host: Jim} applauds Bowie for taking risks and trying new things at this point in his career. However, he thinks the album is too much of a downer and at times moves a little too slowly. That being said, Jim has great respect and gratitude for Bowie, and gives this album a {tag: Try It}. {host: Greg} also enjoyed that Bowie took risks and conveyed his own ideas until the day he died. He overall enjoyed the record more than Jim, really cherishing this final album and its added significance. Plus, Greg still maintains his opinion that David Bowie is a true innovator. He gives *Blackstar* a {tag: Buy It}.
