## 00:01:45 Review: Nine Inch Nails

![Year Zero](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/72/2X0.jpg)

{name : Trent Reznor}'s new {artist : Nine Inch Nails} release is making news not just for its music, but for its marketing campaign. Rather than do the standard set of interviews and appearances, Reznor launched an interactive internet scavenger hunt to explain the album's story and gain interest. The story behind {album : Year Zero} began to unfold when fans discovered that highlighted letters on a NIN concert t-shirt spelled out "I am trying to believe." Add a .com to that, and they were led to their first clue. A series of other clues were then revealed via a network of web sites, MP3 files, videos, phone lines, and even USB drives found in concert bathrooms. Jim and Greg discuss how savvy and 21st century Reznor's guerilla marketing tactics are. While some members of the music industry mourn the death of the CD, Reznor responds by giving the consumer much more than a hard disc of music. It's the modern equivalent to the kind of interactive package and experience fans would get with the great concept albums of the previous rock era. The critics are also impressed with the album itself, which Jim explains is essentially about the end of the world. He calls Reznor a sonic architect for his ability to create amazing soundscapes with just his lap top. And, Greg notes that Reznor's voice is more expressive than it's been on previous albums. Therefore, the album and the entire experience of {album : Year Zero} get two {tag : Buy It}s from both {host : Jim} and {host : Greg}.



## 00:11:17 Interview: Booker T. Jones

When {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} were at {tag : SXSW}, they were invited to interview {genre : soul} legend {name : Booker T. Jones} in front of a live audience. This week, you'll get to hear some highlights of that interview. Jim and Greg start the interview by asking Booker how he became such a musical prodigy. The multi-instrumentalist, who has played tuba, piano, saxophone, guitar, oboe, and of course, most notably, organ, credits his musical family with steering him on that path. This path took him to {label : Stax Records} where he, {name : Steve Cropper}, {name : Al Jackson, Jr.}, and {name : Lewie Steinberg} (later replaced by {name : Duck Dunn}) formed {artist : Booker T. and the MGs}. While Booker was still in high school, the group recorded "{track : Green Onions}," which went on to become one of their most well-known hits.

Jim asks how Booker feels about being relegated to the role of "side man," in music history, but the musician explains that he feels nothing but pride about being "best supporting musician." In fact, Booker explains that being a side man elevated him as a musician and allowed him to do so much more than he would have been able to solo. Some of the people our guest has recorded with over the years include {artist : Otis Redding}, {artist : Sam and Dave}, {artist : Ray Charles}, and even {artist : Barbra Streisand}.

Booker T. and the MG's not only played with an impressive cast in the studio, but on the road as well. {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} highlight his 1967 European tour with other Stax artists, and ask Booker what everyone must have been on to get that powerful, lighting fast tempos. Booker attributes that kind of energy and enthusiasm to people like {artist : Otis Redding} and {artist : Al Jackson}, describing them as "possessed people." The {tag : Monterey International Pop Music Festival} followed in the summer of 1967, and Booker describes this experience as one of the most eye-opening of his life. With everyone (including the {tag : Hell's Angels}) collectively joining in to ensure its success, this concert was an affirmation of the values of peace and love everyone there believed in. The MGs went on to perform with {artist : Neil Young} and with many artists at the {artist : Bob Dylan} tribute in 1992 including {artist : George Harrison} and {artist : Eric Clapton}, who he dishes on later in the interview.

Performing at {place : Monterey} eventually led Booker to leave his steady stream of jobs at Stax and venture out to {place : California}. As a solo performer and producer Booker challenged himself with a number of new projects including a collection of standards for his neighbor, {artist : Willie Nelson}. He also worked in the studio with {artist : Stephen Stills}, {artist : Rita Coolidge}, {artist : Bill Withers} and {artist : Neil Young}.



## 00:42:31 Review: Kings of Leon

![Because of the Times](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/72/1YV0.jpg)

{genre : Southern rock}ers {artist : Kings of Leon} have a new album out called {album : Because of the Times}. The members of the {place : Nashville} quartet were just in their teens when they first got signed to a major label, and now they're on to their third album. Jim comes right out of the gate with his opinion. He explains, "I loathe this album with a bile I reserve for very special occasions." He thought the band was fairly harmless when they were just a hipper take on {artist : The Black Crowes}. But, after receiving much hype from their label and being brought on large scale tours by {artist : Bob Dylan}, {artist : Pearl Jam} and {artist : U2}, they've added an echo-drenched, reverb-laden {genre : arena rock} sound that even U2's {name : The Edge} has moved on from. Because he finds the album retro, sexist and stupid, {host : Jim} gives it a {tag : Trash It} rating. Hearing Jim's review of the record makes {host : Greg} like it even more. He describes Kings of Leon as sloppy Southern rock to the core, and really likes their guitar sound. It's retro, but unapologetically so for Greg. He gives {album : Because of the Times} a {tag : Burn It}.



## 00:51:06 DIJ: Greg

Up next Greg drops a track into the {tag : Desert Island Jukebox}. Coming off of the {artist : Kings of Leon} discussion, he goes back to {genre : Southern rock}'s roots and chooses a song by the real kings of the genre: {artist : Lynyrd Skynyrd}. He describes them as one of the most misunderstood bands of all time. Dismissed as just that bunch of yokels who sang "{track : Freebird}," Greg doesn't think they get the credit they deserve. {name : Ronnie Van Zant}, the original lead singer, and other members of the band died in a plane crash in {era : 1977}. But before that, he was able to lend a subtle sophistication to Skynyrd that other, blusier southern rock outfits didn't have. The track that best illustrates this is "{track : Saturday Night Special}." The song is an eloquent bit of social commentary about the dangers of guns -- not the sort of thing you expect these folks to sing about. And unfortunately, not the sort of song that gets requested at live shows.
