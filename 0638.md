Jim and Greg will also review the new album from {artist: MGMT}.

## 00:02:14 Interview: Sir The Baptist
{artist: Sir The Baptist} is an up-and-coming artist that blends {genre: hip hop} swagger with his {genre: gospel} roots. But, he doesn't turn a blind eye to what's going on in the world around him. Not unlike {artist: The Staple Singers}, Sir is an artist who believes in delivering a message in his songs, whether it's tackling domestic violence with "{track: Deliver Me}," or with violence in the streets with "{track: Wake Up}." He grew up in the church, in fact, his father was a preacher. That background is what keeps him committed to making music that helps to "change the world."  Sir and a 10 piece band joined Jim and Greg in the {tag: Jim and Kay Maybie Performance Studio} to perform songs from his debut album, {album: Saint or Sinner} (one of Jim and Greg's {tag: Best Albums of 2017}), and to talk about the message in his music.

## 00:38:06 Review: MGMT
![Little Dark Age](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/55/fa/4a/55fa4a7f-a932-d685-7755-5b1de8013ee8/source/600x600bb.jpg "251553551/1334814526")
The {genre: pop} {genre: electronic} group {artist: MGMT} just released their fourth album, {album: Little Dark Age}. Formed at Wesleyan University, the band found critical and commercial success almost immediately with their debut record {album: Oracular Spectacular}. Since then however, the band has failed to garner as much attention. {host: Greg} is a bit torn on this album. He thinks there are some horribly cliched and bad tracks like "{track: She Works Out Too Much}" and "{track: TSLAMP}," but he also argues that there are some pretty catchy and solid pop songs ("{track: When You're Small}," "{track: James}".) He gives Little Dark Age a {tag: Try It}. {host: Jim} is far less enthused with the record. On paper, MGMT seems like a band Jim would love, but in reality, he's not the slightest bit smitten. He calls them "smug, derivative and pretentious" and says he would trash this album a million times over. Needless to say, he gives it a {tag: Trash It}.


## 00:45:46 DIJ: Greg
{host: Greg} wants to pay tribute to the late {name: Dennis Edwards}, one of the lead singers of {artist: The Temptations}, by putting a quarter into the {tag: desert island jukebox}. Edwards died in early February at the age of 74. He was the lead singer during the band's second big era, where they delved into the genre of {genre: psychedelic soul} and made some unforgettable contributions. Greg chose the song "{track: Ball of Confusion (That's What the World Is Today)}" because it's a great example of Edwards's vocal capabilities and he finds the theme of the track quite applicable to 2018.
