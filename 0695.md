![Sarah](https://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2019/Sarah_shook.jpg)

{artist: Sarah Shook} is an artist expertly bridging the worlds of {genre: punk} grime and {genre: honky tonk} played on sawdust floors. But it's her smart, pithy lyrics about love that grip listeners and don't let go. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} chat with {genre: country} {genre: singer-songwriter} Sarah Shook about her musical journey, activism, and her latest record, {album: Years}. Also, Greg is back from the {tag: South By Southwest} music conference with a report on some of his new favorite bands.

The 32nd {tag: South By Southwest} festival wrapped up last weekend in {place: Austin, Texas}. The music industry spring break has long been one of the best places to discover ambitious new bands for record labels, managers, promoters and critics. {host: Jim} was sad to miss the event for the first time in 27 years, but was eager to hear what {host: Greg} learned while down south. 

Greg was happy to report that after years of expansion (the film and tech conferences are in some ways bigger newsmakers now) and over-the-top corporate presence ([Doritos vending machine stage, anyone?](https://www.fastcompany.com/3027313/doritos-has-a-bold-mission-and-lady-gaga-for-sxsw-attendees)), the music festival was scaled-back this year. There was less focus on major stars and more emphasis on acts from around the world. 

The decline in corporate influence at {tag: SXSW} could be heard in the keynote address from {name: T. Bone Burnett}, the producer of many Coen brothers film soundtracks. He didn't hold back, claiming that tech companies like {tag: Facebook} and {tag: Google} were a threat to our humanity. 

"To stay human, to survive as a species, we have to wrest our communications out of the control of the lust for power, the avarice, larceny, hubris, deceit, and self-delusion of the heads of Google and Facebook. I am confident that we can do this," Burnett said. 

Greg juxtaposed Burnett's comments against a panel with {name: Nile Rodgers} on songwriting as an investment. In that discussion Rodgers' business partner made a plea to keep streaming platforms like {tag: Spotify} alive until they can become worldwide platforms despite the low dividends they provide artists now. 

#### Greg's new music discoveries 

- [{artist: Cimafunk}](https://cimafunk.com/), a project of {name: Erik Alejandro Rodriguez} that blends {genre: Afro-Cuban} polyrhythms with {artist: Fela Kuti} {genre: trance} vibes.
- [{artist: Trupa Trupa}](https://trupatrupa.bandcamp.com/), a Polish band he saw last year at SXSW and signed to {label: Sub Pop Records} as a result of that visit. 
- [{artist: Tasha}](https://www.wowtashawow.com/), a Chicago-based solo artist with radiant stage presence who reminded Greg of the {genre: folk soul} movement of the 1960s and 70s.

## 00:45:00 Obituary: Dick Dale
![Dick Dale](https://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2019/dick.jpg)

Innovative guitarist {artist: Dick Dale} passed away this week at age 81. Dale brought his unique brand of {genre: surf} guitar to the masses with a series of recordings originally released on his own {tag: Deltone Records}, later released on {label: Capitol Records} alongside {artist: The Beach Boys}. He was known for folding {place: Middle Eastern} flourishes into his style, and for his heavy use of {artist: reverb}, which influnced artists that came after him like {artist: Jimi Hendrix}. He was also known for playing loud and hard, utilizing heavy gauge strings to acheive his signature sound, long before metal heads pushed the volume to 11.  His style of {genre: surf rock} was exclipsed by the {era: 1960s} {tag: British Invasion}, but he was able to start touring again in the {era: mid-1990s} when the {name: Quentin Tarentino} film {tag: Pulp Fiction} featured his 1962 record, "{track: Miserlou}," in a pivotal scene. Dale continued touring and playing for the rest of his life. 

## 00:50:00 Obituary: Andre Williams
![Andre](https://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2019/andre.jpg)

Legendary {genre: R&B} songwriter, producer and performer {artist: Andre Williams}, also passed away recently, at the age 82. Andre was born in {place: Alabama}, but got his start in {era: 1950s} {place: Detroit}, where he gained the nickname Mr. Rhythm. He was later also known as the Godfather of {genre: Rap}, and his slick spoken vocals on the {era: 1956} classic "{track: Bacon Fat}" are evidence of why. Williams went on the work with artists from {artist: Stevie Wonder} to the {artist: Red Hot Chili Peppers}, but Jim will always remember him for his dapper day-glo suits, and for his 2012 recording called "{track: I Gotta Get Shorty Out Of Jail}," which was released on indie label {label: Bloodshot Records}.
