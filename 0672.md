## 00:39:02 Interview: Geoff Emerick
![Geoff](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2018/geoff_e.jpg)
{name: Geoff Emerick } was in the right place at the right time- starting a job at {place: Abbey Road Studios} just days before {artist: The Beatles} recorded "{track: Love Me Do}." By the time they began recording {album: Revolver}, Emerick had been promoted to engineer. It was up to him to make John, Paul, George and Ringo's creative dreams a reality in the studio, a challenge Emerick recounted in his 2006 book, [{tag: Here, There and Everywhere}](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/294781/here-there-and-everywhere-by-geoff-emerick/9781592402694/). He went on to work on {album: Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band}, {album: Magical Mystery Tour}, part of {album: The White Album} and {album: Abbey Road}. 

Beyond {artist: The Beatles}, Emerick worked with {artist: Art Garfunkel}, {artist: Elvis Costello}, {artist: Jeff Beck}, {artist: Michael Jackson}, {artist: The Zombies}, {artist: Cheap Trick}, {artist: Stevie Wonder} and {artist: Wings}. Emerick died October 2, 2018 at 72 years old. 

We revisit Jim and Greg's conversation with Emerick from 2006.
