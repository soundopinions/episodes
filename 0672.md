## 00:39:02 Interview: Geoff Emerick

![Geoff](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/672/1T20.jpg)

{name : Geoff Emerick} was in the right place at the right time- starting a job at {place : Abbey Road Studios} just days before {artist : The Beatles} recorded "{track : Love Me Do}." By the time they began recording {album : Revolver}, Emerick had been promoted to engineer. It was up to him to make John, Paul, George and Ringo's creative dreams a reality in the studio, a challenge Emerick recounted in his 2006 book, [{tag : Here, There and Everywhere}](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/294781/here-there-and-everywhere-by-geoff-emerick/9781592402694/). He went on to work on {album : Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band}, {album : Magical Mystery Tour}, part of {album : The White Album} and {album : Abbey Road}.

Beyond {artist : The Beatles}, Emerick worked with {artist : Art Garfunkel}, {artist : Elvis Costello}, {artist : Jeff Beck}, {artist : Michael Jackson}, {artist : The Zombies}, {artist : Cheap Trick}, {artist : Stevie Wonder} and {artist : Wings}. Emerick died October 2, 2018 at 72 years old.

We revisit Jim and Greg's conversation with Emerick from 2006.
