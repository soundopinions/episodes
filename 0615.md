# Show 615: The Artist vs. the Art, The National, Queens of the Stone Age & Walter Becker
![Artist from the Art](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2017/artandartist_web.jpg)

Should we hold musicians to a moral standard? {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} talk with {place: Duke University} professor and cultural critic {name: Mark Anthony Neal} and music and culture journalist {name: Britt Julious} about whether art can be evaluated separately from the artist's ethics. Plus, reviews of new releases by {artist: The National} and {artist: Queens of the Stone Age}, and tributes to {name: Walter Becker} of {artist: Steely Dan}, and {name: Holger Czukay} of the influential "{genre: Krautrock}" group {artist: Can}.



## 00:01:45 Interview: The Artist vs. the Art
Oscar Wilde once wrote,  "There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written or badly written." That is, should we judge an artist's output by their personal morals? Can you enjoy a song, when you know the person performing it has done some despicable things? This question is not new to music criticism. It applies to artists like {artist: Chuck Berry}, {artist: Jerry Lee Lewis}, {artist: Miles Davis} and more contemporary artists like {artist: Pwr Bttm} and {artist: R. Kelly}. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} are joined by journalist {name: Britt Julious} (who has written for the Chicago Tribune, Esquire, Elle, and others) and {name: Mark Anthony Neal} (cultural critic and professor of African and African American Studies at Duke) for a discussion about whether we can, and should, hold a musician's artistic output to a moral standard.  

## 00:26:00 Review: The National

The {genre: indie rock} band {artist: The National} just released their 7th studio album, {album: Sleep Well Beast}. On this record, {host: Jim} says the band's expressive lyricism, whether it's about world and governmental politics or politics in lead singer {name: Matt Berninger}'s marriage, is as strong as ever. He's generally been a fan of the group, but what makes this album a {tag: Buy It} for him is the record's {genre: electronic} experimentation in the vein of {artist: Radiohead}, as well as its impressive and steady guitar work. {host: Greg} believes that The National has always been a consistent band, and agrees with Jim that the ominous electronic undertones of the album make it unique and almost eerie. While Greg thinks this record is missing a little bit of The National's signature emotional explosiveness, he still finds it to be a {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:34:24 Review: Queens of the Stone Age
![Villains](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/615/1LC0.jpg)
{artist: Queens of the Stone Age} talk {album: Villains} on their 7th release (double 7s this week!). Led by {artist: Josh Homme}, the group emerged from the ashes of the {genre: desert rock} band {artist: Kyuss} and released their debut record in {era: 1998}. Almost 20 years later, Queens has had a revolving cast of characters making up the band, but both {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} think they finally settled on the right chemistry with {name: Dean Fertita}, {name: Troy Van Leeuwin}, {name: Jon Theodore} and {name: Michael Shuman} alongside Homme. While initially skeptical, Greg likes producer {name: Mark Ronson}'s ({artist: Amy Winehouse} & {artist: Bruno Mars} collaborator) spin on the record. He thinks Ronson helped elevate the more "dancy" and rhythmic components of Queens. Greg gives Villains a {tag: Buy It}. Jim loves the riffs and rhythms on this record, but thinks that Greg's praise of the lyrics as more than just another element in the wall of sound are a bit much. However, Jim loves the song "{track: Feet Don't Fail Me}" because of its myth-like storytelling. Jim gives Villains a {tag: Buy It} as well.

## 00:45:31 Obit: Walter Becker
![walter becker](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/615/23V0.jpg)

{name: Walter Becker}, one half of the iconic band {artist: Steely Dan}, has died at the age of 67. While singer {name: Donald Fagen} is the better known member of Steely Dan, Becker's role was just as important as incredible guitarist and bassist. In later years of the band, Fagen and Becker operated esentially as a songwriting duo with a rotating ream of back-up musicians. While the band might be written off as a slick jazz-influenced rock band, there is also a subversive wit to their songs. Greg memorializes Becker's guitar chops and sneering sarcasm and plays the song {track: Black Friday}.

## 00:51:20 Obit: Holger Czukay
![holger czukay](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/615/2DK0.jpg)

Another sad passing this week is {artist: Holger Czukay}, bass player for the {genre: Krautrock} band {artist: Can}, who has died at age 79. Holger was one of the founding members of Can, a band who's influence can be felt in much electronic music and more experimental rock bands like {artist: Radiohead}. Jim notes that Czukay's bass playing wasn't flashy but the simplicity of it held everything together. In memory of Holger Czukay, Jim plays {track: Halleluwah} from the album {album: Tago Mago}.
