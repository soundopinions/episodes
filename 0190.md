**A message from Jim:**
The following, LISTED IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER, is my tally of albums mid-year in 2009 that have all warranted 3.5 stars or more on the Chicago Sun-Times' 4-star ratings scale (making them all very enthusiastic "buy its" on the "Sound Opinions" scale). I will mention that these are in no particular order (sorry, but that's reserved for the year-end list), that this list is not all-inclusive (I will no doubt catch up with quite a few discs released earlier in the year by the time I tally the year-end list) and, also, because this always confuses people, THESE ARE IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER. Yet. But they're all really, really, really good albums.

## 00:39:53 Review: Moby
![Wait For Me](http://assets.rollingstone.com/assets/images/album_review/5a50f94571d62af80509729c70531252ab1de2eb.jpg "789023/682211208")
{artist: Moby} has a new album out called {album: Wait for Me}. The musician has spent a decade trying to follow up the success of his {era: 1999} album {album: Play}. And if his last record was a night out on the town, this is the comedown for {host: Greg}. He recorded it at home, and you can hear that sense of isolation. Greg's only quibble is the length, so he gives it a {tag: Buy It}. {host: Jim} agrees. He hears the newly independent artist connecting with his roots, again taking inspiration from {name: David Lynch}. Moby gets a double Buy It.

## 00:47:02 Review: Cheap Trick
![The Latest](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/a3/18/40/a31840c7-2a5e-20ee-61e7-1d3e5e90b17d/source/600x600bb.jpg "461577/325396123")

{place: Rockford, IL}'s own {artist: Cheap Trick} have been making music for four decades. So, you wouldn't expect much from them now, right? But, as {host: Jim} says, these "geezers" are fierce. He calls them one of the hardest-working bands in show business, and says they still have the goods on stage and in the studio. He gives {album: The Latest} a {tag: Buy It}. {host: Greg} hears Cheap Trick taking risks again, and states that any band with {name: Bunny Carlos} as drummer is great. He also gives the album a Buy It rating.
