## 00:00:00 Interview: Kyle Ryan of Band Name Bureau

Band Name Bureau catalogs and celebrates funny, weird, and questionable band names. It started in 2005 when critic {name : Kyle Ryan} began collecting names while at The A.V. Club. His annual “Year in Band Names” became a beloved tradition until he left in 2018. Now he keeps the mission alive via newsletter and social media. He joins Sound Opinions for this episode to talk about hilariously bad band names.
