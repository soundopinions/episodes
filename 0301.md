## 00:40:26 Review: Red Hot Chili Peppers
![I'm With You](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/74/RHCP_I'm_With_You_Cover.jpg "889780/450747622")
Once fresh faces in the frat {genre: punk} world, the {artist: Red Hot Chili Peppers} are a heritage act at this point. Their 10th album {album: I'm With You} is one of many collaborations with super{tag: producer} {name: Rick Rubin}. And it's the first with new {tag: guitarist} {name: Josh Klinghoffer}. Lead {tag: singer} {name: Anthony Kiedis} considers this a reboot, but Greg's having a hard time buying their new identity as a stadium ballad band. He misses the guitar virtuosity of {tag: John Frusciante}, who quit in 2009. {name: Flea} remains an all-star {tag: bass player}, but he can't save I'm With You. {host: Greg} says {tag: Trash It}. {host: Jim} agrees with that sentiment, pointing to the lousy, mush-mouthed lyrics of Kiedis as his primary hurdle. This is not a sensitive band, and he would welcome a return to funk rock. Until then...Trash It.

## 00:47:41 Review: Lil' Wayne
![Tha Carter IV](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/1d/bd/1b/1dbd1be7-95e4-54d4-ffe5-76d233d466c4/source/600x600bb.jpg "5869117/459862427")

{artist: Lil Wayne} is fresh out of {place: Rikers} with the 4th album in his {album: Tha Carter} series, {album: Tha Carter IV}. But curiously, he doesn't give much time to his jail experience. For the past decade, he's been one of the most successful rappers in the business, both with his releases and mixtapes, but also as an ever-present cameo fixture. {host: Jim} describes {name: Weezy} as an interesting {tag: producer}, but he can't get over the {genre: hip-hop} clich'es. Tell us about prison, he pleads. Without those insights, this is a {tag: Trash It }album. {host: Greg} was surprised to find that the most interesting rapping on {album: Tha Carter IV} was not by Lil Wayne himself. Rather, guests like {album: Andre 3000}, {artist: Tech 9} and {artist: Busta Rhymes} take the prize. So for those tracks alone, Greg says {tag: Burn It}.
