# Show 247: Electric Warrior (Classic Album Dissection) & Opinions on John Mellencamp

## 00:01:46 News: 8.20.2010
Just when you thought there weren't enough music industry lawsuits, now they're going after people before they even commit the crime! {tag: AEG} and {tag: Live Nation} have jumped on a growing legal trend in the concert world by filing a trademark infringement claim against John Does and Jane Does. In anticipation of a number of concerts across the country, the companies have petitioned the courts to have federal and local authorities seize trademark-infringing gear. Considering last month's news that the {tag: RIAA} has wasted a ton of dough on lawsuits, this one leaves Jim and Greg scratching their heads.

{genre: Jazz} great {artist: Abbey Lincoln} died this week at age 80. Lincoln began as a "Marilyn Monroe type," but remade herself as an intense, political vocalist after meeting {artist: Max Roach}. To honor Lincoln Jim and Greg play "{track: Driva' Man}," her performance on Roach's 1960 {album: Freedom Now Suite}.

## 00:08:27 Classic Album Dissection: Electric Warrior
![Electric Warrior (Remastered)](http://assets.rollingstone.com/assets/images/album_review/33de0c1ca85110de81805e05a09701e058a8407d.jpg "5132974/5133011")
{artist: David Bowie} gets all the {genre: glam} rock credit. But real fans know the look and the sound go back to {artist: T. Rex}'s 1971 release {album: Electric Warrior}. {tag: Singer} {name: Marc Bolan} shook off some of his "pixie dust" and hippy-dippy Tyrannosaurus Rex sound to create a glossy, sexy record full of humor, sadness and lots of electric guitar fuzz, not to mention his signature vibrato. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} talk to the album's {tag: producer} {name: Tony Visconti} about Electric Warrior's recording. They also highlight their favorite tracks: Jim went with "{track: Rip Off}," a song that is as silly as it is indignant. Greg chose "{track: Cosmic Dancer}," which he says illustrates Bolan's growth as well as Visconti's. And anyone who has ever watched {tag: *Billy Elliot*} would agree.

Listen to more of [Jim and Greg's conversation with Tony Visconti](/show/143/), including the making of David Bowie's "{track: Heroes}".

## 00:42:18 Review: John Mellencamp
![No Better Than This - Single](http://assets.rollingstone.com/assets/images/album_review/a588c343f8127944a531abf76b40daa776a67fd4.jpg "79969/382523961")
For his new album {album: No Better Than This}, {artist: John Mellencamp} teamed up with veteran {tag: producer} {artist: T. Bone Burnett}. He and Burnett recorded in three iconic locations: {place: First African Baptist Church} in {place: Savannah}, {place: Sun Studios} in {place: Memphis} and the {place: Gunter Hotel} in {place: San Antonio}. But Jim thinks they might have been better off staying put. He doesn't like the sound, nor does he appreciate the lack of humor. {host: Jim} gives this "pile of cow dung" a {tag: Trash It}. {host: Greg} can't believe it. Not only does he love the loose songwriting, he heard a lot of humor, and tells people to {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:48:32 Review: Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World
![Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) [Deluxe Version]](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/2e/6b/79/2e6b791d-d28a-f152-a33e-368022a6ff11/source/600x600bb.jpg "4035426/385049856")
Reviews have been pretty solid for the movie {album: Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World}. But what about the music? The film was scored by {tag: producer} {artist: Nigel Godrich}, and the soundtrack features songs by {artist: Broken Social Scene}, {artist: The Black Lips} and {artist: Beck}, or Sex Bob Omb as the fictional band is known in the film. {host: Greg} doesn't think it holds up much as an album. It's more of a souvenir of the movie than anything else. He gives it a {tag: Trash It}. {host: Jim} calls Greg cold-hearted. He loves this "generation Y mixtape," and tells people to get the record even if they don't see the movie (though he recommends that too). Jim gives a {tag: Buy It} rating.
