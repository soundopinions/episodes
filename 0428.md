## 00:02:25 News: 02.07.14
Actor {name: Philip Seymour Hoffman} was found dead in his {place: Manhattan} apartment last Sunday morning. While Hoffman, 46, was known for dozens of lead roles, {host: Jim} had a special connection to his portrayal of rock critic {name: Lester Bangs} in the {era: 2000} {name: Cameron Crowe} film {tag: *Almost Famous*}. Jim—who, as a fledgling 17-year-old rock critic, had interviewed Bangs in 1982—completed his biography of Bangs around the time that the movie came out. In an interview for the book, Crowe recounted how Hoffman, to get into [character](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpISLkb5L5E), would walk the streets of {place: San Diego} listening to young Jim's conversation with the larger-than-life Bangs. As Jim says, there was a lot of rock n' roll in Hoffman's soul. He'll be missed.

## 00:49:27 Review: Against Me!
![Transgender Dysphoria Blues](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a5/Transgender_Dysphoria_Blues_cover_art.jpg "6946251/735513410")
{artist: Against Me!} has gone through some changes since forming in the late {era: 1990s}, but none more radical than that of the group's founder and front person {name: Tom Gabel}. In 2012 he announced that he would be identifying as a woman named {name: Laura Jane Grace}. This transformative experience made an impact on the group, and the result is {album: *Transgender Dysphoria Blues*}. {host: Greg} finds the record a harrowing document, akin to a diary entry. The stripped-down, acoustic production matches the raw content of Grace's lyrics perfectly. But those lyrics fall down when she tackles other topics like geopolitics. That said, it's a {tag: Buy It}. {host: Jim} doesn't think Greg fully appreciates Grace's intellectual heft the same way he does the anthemic music. The album's commentary on issues such as rape culture and death are just as provocative as the songs about Grace's personal life. He hails {album: Transgender Dysphoria Blues} as the first great album of {era: 2014} and is happy to strongly second Greg's {tag: Buy It}.
