## 00:01:49 News: 6.07.2013
(Unfortunately) the music news is often focused on a death in the industry. This week it's the death of a club. {place: Maxwell}'s in {place: Hoboken, NJ} will be closing its doors next month. This is the famous bar where {artist: Nirvana} performed, {artist: Bruce Springsteen} shot the [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vQpW9XRiyM) for "{track: Glory Days}," and {artist: Yo La Tengo} celebrated {tag: Chanukah}. This is also the place where a young {host: Jim DeRogatis} came of musical age. Read his tribute [here](http://www.wbez.org/blogs/jim-derogatis/2013-06/rip-maxwell%e2%80%99s-requiem-rock-club-107531). And check out our own live [recording](http://www.soundopinions.org/show/138) at Maxwell's with {artist: The Feelies}.

{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} also say farewell to {name: Marvin Junior} who sang tenor in the Chicago {genre: R&B} group {artist: The Dells}. As Greg explains, the original members performed together for six decades, something many groups from that era weren't able to do. Perhaps that's why {name: Robert Townsend} captured their story in *{tag: The Five Heartbeats}*.

## 00:06:46 List: Best of 2013... So Far
Conscientious critics that they are, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} don't leave their {tag: best-of list} making until December. This week, they get a jump on their 2013 "Best of" list by giving us their top albums of the year so far. Here's what made the cut as the {tag: mid-year best}:

### Jim 
- {artist: Savages}, {album: Silence Yourself}
- {artist: Wire}, {album: Change Becomes Us}
- {artist: Karl Bartos}, {album: Off the Record}
- {artist: Foxygen}, {album: We Are the 21st Century Ambassadors of Peace & Magic}

- {artist: Chance the Rapper}, {album: Acid Rap}
- {artist: Rhye}, {album: Woman}

## 00:42:55 Review: Queens of the Stone Age

![Queens of the Stone Age; Like Clockwork](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/393/1ZJ0.jpg "https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/...like-clockwork/id630719740?uo=4")

After six years of silence, {artist: Queens of the Stone Age} are back with yet another addition to their stoner rock catalogue. As {host: Greg}. explains, {album: ...Like Clockwork} follows a tough period in {tag: lead-singer} {name: Josh Homme}'s life: he recently suffered dangerous complications from surgery as well as depression. But Greg takes {album: ...Like Clockwork} as a hopeful sign for the band, calling it Queens' best work in a decade. After veering off into weirdness on 2007's {album: Era Vulgaris}, Greg welcomes the return of strong songwriting and melodies on this record. He says {tag: Buy it}. {host: Jim} can't agree. {album: ...Like Clockwork} is the kind of record the {tag: Try it} rating was designed for, he says. Cut the dreadful slow tracks and you've got a decent {artist: Queen} EP.

##  00:49:14 DIJ: Greg
It seems that {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} have been in a {genre: progressive rock} mood of late, at least when it comes to their trips to the tropical isle. This week Greg looks to {artist: Procol Harum}, a pioneer in the British prog scene. You of course know this [song](http://www.youtube.com/embed/5T7WujWrn7c). But the track that {host: Greg} adds to the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox} is {era: 1969}'s "{track: Salty Dog}." It evokes desperation, drama and fear. Amazing considering it began in a bathroom in {place: Cleveland}.
