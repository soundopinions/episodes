# Show 358: Rock Doctors with Mark Crilley and Reviews of Mumford & Sons and Lupe Fiasco
Jim and Greg are the {tag: Rock Doctors}. They prescribe a musical remedy for a rock fan in need: this time acclaimed graphic novelist & comic book writer, Mark Crilley, is in the waiting room.

## 00:01:45 News: 10.5.2012
It's been a busy week for the pop charts. For 45 years, {artist: Elvis} dominated the {tag: Billboard Top 100} with 108 career hits. This week {artist: Lil' Wayne} beat The King's record with his 109th hit - a cameo in {artist: The Game}'s "{track: Celebration}." And with 600,000 in first week sales {place: British} folkies {artist: Mumford & Sons} had the biggest opening of {tag: 2012} with {album: Babel}. They also beat Spotify's streaming record, with 8 million listens in its first week. So much for the theory that streaming cannibalizes sales.

After upsetting fans at {place: New York's Global Citizen Festival} with the announcement that the band had no upcoming shows, {name: Dave Grohl} has finally put those {artist: Foo Fighter} breakup fears to rest (or not?). In a letter on the band's website, Grohl says the band is simply on hiatus. Jim says he wouldn't mind if the hiatus were permanent.

## 00:05:54 Rock Doctors: Mark Crilley
Those of you lucky enough to be able to work to music know that finding a perfect soundtrack isn't always easy. There's the matter of tempo, lyrics and beats. And for acclaimed comic book creator, children's book writer/illustrator and graphic novelist {name: Mark Crilley}, the challenge is "vibe." His latest series for {tag: Dark Horse} is {tag: *Brody's Ghost*}. It follows a serial killer hunter, and the material is much darker than his {tag: *Akiko and Miki Falls*} series. Dark art calls for dark tunes, but Mark is a self-proclaimed musical "softie." So he contacted the Rock Doctors to get a prescription for albums that are edgy, but still full of pop hooks and melody.

Dr. Kot prescribed {album: Stridulum II} by {artist: Zola Jesus}. The {place: Wisconsin} native combines an operatic voice and Gothic keyboards to create musical psychodramas. After taking his medicine for a week, Mark decides that a couple of the tracks will make his playlist, but for the most part this album was too dark. Dr. DeRogatis prescribed {album: The Haunted Man} by {artist: Bat for Lashes}. This is {name: Natasha Khan}'s third release, and Mark fell in love with moody lyrics and surprising production. The Haunted Man worked like a miracle pill, and he'll be going back for this one while working on the 4th installment of Brody's Ghost. Look for it next spring.

## 00:31:52 Review: Mumford & Sons
![Babel (Deluxe Version)](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music4/v4/5b/4a/76/5b4a7679-f1f9-bb31-3d69-641766c83cd6/source/600x600bb.jpg "307699986/561523466")

{artist: Mumford & Sons}' sophomore album {album: Babel} has done gangbusters on the album charts, but how will it fare on Sound Opinions' Buy It, Burn It, Trash It scale? Mumford & Co. emerged from {place: London}'s thriving {genre: folk-rock} scene in 2009 with a breakout album {album: Sigh No More} that landed them a slot performing with {artist: Bob Dylan} at the {tag: Grammys}. With their vests, beards, banjo, and dobro, the band sticks out in the mainstream rock scene, but as {host: Greg} explains, the difference is only skin deep. The boys' folky instruments and wardrobe are just signifiers of folk. At its base Mumford & Sons are a sadly conventional arena rock band. {host: Jim} could not agree more. The band's lyrics are vague and bland-the complete opposite of the biblical stories that they claim as inspiration. Babel gets a double {tag: Trash It}.

## 00:42:50 Review: Lupe Fiasco
![Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor (5th Anniversary Edition)](http://hypetrak.com/images/2011/09/lupe-fiasco-food-liquor.jpg "2851441/463223395")
Next up is rapper {artist: Lupe Fiasco}'s {album: Food & Liquor II: The Great American Rap Album} . It wasn't too long ago in 2006 that Jim and Greg reviewed Lupe's debut, the original {album: Food & Liquor}.
 It was a standout album in a wave of conscious {genre: hip-hop} coming out of {place: Chicago} at the time. Now at age 30, Lupe is a veteran of the rap game. What does he have to offer on Food & Liquor II? According to {host: Jim}, plenty of food for thought. Lupe is rapping about issues like misogyny, economic exploitation of the poor, and native American rights that Jim says no one else in hip-hop is tackling. And if Lupe sometimes gets a little preachy, he also leavens his critiques with humor. {host: Greg} agrees, but he wishes the greatness of Lupe's lyrics were matched by consistently great production. Despite those production flaws, Food & Liquor II gets a double {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:50:02 DIJ: Jim
After {artist: Mumford & Sons}, {host: Jim} was sorely in need of a {genre: folk-rock} palette cleanser. So for his {tag: DIJ} he chose one of the great folk rock musicians of all time, {artist: Richard Thompson}. A founder of {artist: Fairport Convention}, Thompson went on to make music with his wife, {name: Linda Thompson}, and as a solo artist. Like Marcus Mumford, Thompson has a yen for the biblical. But unlike Mumford, he used Bible stories to spine-tingling affect. Case in point, "{track: The Calvary Cross}," a track he recorded with Linda on their 1974 album {album: I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight}. Listen for the drums echoing Jesus's footsteps as he climbs the hill where he will be crucified.
