Born in Jersey City, New Jersey, the year the Beatles arrived in America, [Jim DeRogatis](http://jimdero.com/) began voicing his opinions about rock 'n' roll shortly thereafter. He is an associate professor of instruction in the Department of English and Creative Writing at Columbia College Chicago, and a contributor to *The New Yorker*. Together with Greg Kot of *The Chicago Tribune*, he co-hosts *Sound Opinions*. DeRogatis spent fifteen years as the rock critic at *The Chicago Sun-Times* and is the author of several [books](http://www.jimdero.com/BooksProjectsOpen.html) about music: *Let It Blurt: The Life and Times of Lester Bangs, America's Greatest Rock Critic*; *Soulless: The Case Against R. Kelly*; *The Velvet Underground: An Illustrated History of a Walk on the Wild Side*; *Staring at Sound: The True Story of Oklahoma's Fabulous Flaming Lips*; *Turn On Your Mind: Four Decades of Great Psychedelic Rock*; and *Milk It! Collected Musings on the Alternative Music Explosion of the '90s*. In 2010, he and Kot issued their first book together, *The Beatles vs. the Rolling Stones: Sound Opinions on the Great Rock 'n' Roll Rivalry*, written in the fun but combative style of the radio show. DeRogatis has played in punk-rock bands since age thirteen but jokes that he is a drummer, not a musician. He lives on the North Side of Chicago with his wife Carmel (with whom he edited the 2004 anthology *Kill Your Idols: A New Generation of Rock Writers Reconsiders the Classics*).
