## Sound Opinions: Listen Critically

*Sound Opinions* is where people who love music can come together.
You can make discoveries, debate, learn about pop culture, engage, have fun and find new ways to further enrich your lives through music.

Whether you're an expert, or just a casual fan, *Sound Opinions* is your source for smart and engaging music criticism and conversation. Each week on the show, nationally respected rock critics {host: Greg Kot} and {host: Jim DeRogatis} interview artists, talk about pop culture and music industry news, review new record releases and give trends a historical context. And, because on *Sound Opinions*, "everyone's a critic," listeners are invited to join in the debate.  

*Sound Opinions* is distributed nationally by [{tag: PRX}](http://www.prx.org/soundopinions/). *Sound Opinions* can be heard on stations across the country and online at SoundOpinions.org.

### Jim DeRogatis

![Jim Derogatis](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2016/jderogatis.jpg)

Born in Jersey City, New Jersey, the year the Beatles arrived in America, [Jim DeRogatis](http://jimdero.com/) began voicing his opinions about rock ‘n’ roll shortly thereafter. He is an associate professor of instruction in the Department of English and Creative Writing at Columbia College Chicago, and a contributor to *The New Yorker*. Together with Greg Kot of *The Chicago Tribune*, he co-hosts *Sound Opinions*. DeRogatis spent fifteen years as the rock critic at *The Chicago Sun-Times* and is the author of several [books](http://www.jimdero.com/BooksProjectsOpen.html) about music: *Let It Blurt: The Life and Times of Lester Bangs, America's Greatest Rock Critic*; *Soulless: The Case Against R. Kelly*; *The Velvet Underground: An Illustrated History of a Walk on the Wild Side*; *Staring at Sound: The True Story of Oklahoma's Fabulous Flaming Lips*; *Turn On Your Mind: Four Decades of Great Psychedelic Rock*; and *Milk It! Collected Musings on the Alternative Music Explosion of the '90s*. In 2010, he and Kot issued their first book together, *The Beatles vs. the Rolling Stones: Sound Opinions on the Great Rock 'n' Roll Rivalry*, written in the fun but combative style of the radio show. DeRogatis has played in punk-rock bands since age thirteen but jokes that he is a drummer, not a musician. He lives on the North Side of Chicago with his wife Carmel (with whom he edited the 2004 anthology *Kill Your Idols: A New Generation of Rock Writers Reconsiders the Classics*). Contact him at [jimdero.com](jimdero.com).
