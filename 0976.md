# Show 976: Lou Reed's Entire Discography and Reviews of Common and Jack White



## 00:00:00 Intro: Coming Soon

Hosts Jim DeRogatis and Greg Kot have talked about Lou Reed many times before on Sound Opinions, but often the discussion gets focused on the man's life instead of his music. This week they talk with author Jim Higgins about his new book that reviews every album Reed released in his lifetime. The hosts also review new albums from Common and Jack White.
