## 00:01:45 News: 07.25.08
After all the hubbub caused by the "Nipplegate" scandal, the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals has now tossed out the {tag: FCC}'s {tag: indecency} fine against {tag: CBS}. The network aired {artist: Janet Jackson}'s famous {tag: wardrobe malfunction} during the {era: 2004} {tag: Super Bowl halftime show} and was subsequently fined $550,000 by the {tag: FCC}. The court ruled that the FCC acted arbitrarily and can't change 3 decades of policy without due cause. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} are curious to see how this decision will impact broadcasting and music performances on television in the future.

## 00:03:52 Review: Miley Cyrus
![Breakout](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/139/6G0.jpg)

The name you are sure to hear this year, especially if you are a parent, is {artist: Miley Cyrus}. The tween sensation has shed her Hannah Montana alter-ego to release her first solo album Breakout. While much of the talk about {name: [Miley] Cyrus} concerns her rocky road to adulthood, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} focus on the music. Greg hears nothing out of the ordinary: "assembly line {genre: pop rock}." It's like second-rate Go-Go's, which isn't a bad thing, but he hopes fans graduate to something more interesting after this album. Greg gives {album: Breakout} a {tag: Try It}. Jim is much more enthusiastic, calling the album "absolutely wonderful." It's exactly what he would encourage parents to give their kids. He gives it a {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:09:31 Special: When Jim and Greg Were Wrong
Music fans tell Jim and Greg they are wrong all the time, but the critics are not too big to admit it themselves. This week they come clean with some of their critical errors. Here are Greg's self-confessed mistakes:

### Greg

#### Jesus Jones
Greg initially liked the {artist: Jesus Jones}' melding of {genre: rock} and {genre: techno} in songs like "{track: Right, Here, Right Now}," but can see now that they weren't the breakouts he thought they'd be.

#### Oasis
The {place: British} brothers were immediate hits in their own country, but not with Greg. He admits that he fell prey to that common critical trap of being a "hype-buster." But now, listening to {artist: Oasis} songs like "{track: Champagne Supernova}," he has to admit that they are solid, melodic {genre: rock} songs. Sorry, Gallaghers.

#### U2
Greg didn't take to the band's album {album: Achtung Baby} when it came out in {era: 1991}. He was used to a different sound from the {place: Irish} rockers. But after seeing them tour behind the album, he grew to love it and now counts it as his favorite {artist: U2} album.

#### R.E.M.
Contemporaries of {artist: U2}, {artist: R.E.M} shed their {era: '80s} image with the album {album: Monster}. In retrospect, Greg doesn't think this effort was so successful. What he once saw as {genre: glam}, now appears shallow, and the songs just don't hold up.

### Jim
While Jim was stumped to think of any bands that had fallen from grace and stands behind all his pleasures, guilty or not, he did reveal some bands he was quick to dismiss and grew to love. Here's where Jim had it wrong:

#### Radiohead 
Partly because of its subject matter, and partly because of {name: Thom Yorke}'s vocal style, Jim found {artist: Radiohead}'s album off-putting. But, as time has gone by, he's come to appreciate Yorke's voice and now understands that {album: OK Computer} was fittingly cold and alienating.

#### The Jam 
Jim confesses that he used to mock his good friend for being such a huge fan of the {place: British} Mod-revivalists. But, after becoming a fan of {name: Paul Weller}'s solo work, Jim has since gone back to {artist: The Jam} and become a fan in his own right.

#### Arcade Fire 
Jim really loves the orch-pop genre, but was dubious of these indie phenoms. He was lukewarm to negative on their debut {album: Funeral}, but after seeing the {artist: Arcade Fire} live and really getting to hear those rhythms he can admit that he was wrong.

## 00:41:47 Review: The Hold Steady
![Stay Positive](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/139/1XN0.jpg)

{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} review two of the bands who appeared at last weekend's {tag: Pitchfork Music Festival}. The first up for review is {artist: The Hold Steady}. Their fourth album, {album: Stay Positive}, continues with the band's literary bar music formula, but according to Greg, the emphasis has been moved away from {tag: guitarist} {name: Tad Kubler}'s riffs and hooks. Greg wishes there was more great guitar work and less "harpsichord filagree." He gives Stay Positive a {tag: Try It}. Jim has never been a Hold Steady fan, but was impressed with their performance at Pitchfork. On record is another story. He agrees with Greg about the {tag: keyboards} and describes Stay Positive as overdone and a whole lot of nothing. Jim gives the album a {tag: Trash it}.

## 00:49:19 Review: King Khan and the Shrines
![kink khan and the shrines](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/139/2A70.jpg)
The day after The Hold Steady took the stage, {tag: Pitchfork [Music Festival]} fans were wowed by the antics of {artist: King Khan and the Shrines}. {host: Jim} was less wowed with Khan's own wardrobe malfunction, which he felt distracted from the music. He's impressed with Khan's collection of past recordings, {album: The Supreme Genius of King Khan & the Shrines}, which is almost like {artist: Iggy Pop} meets {artist: James Brown}. {host: Greg} hears Nuggets-era {genre: soul}, and thinks The Supreme Genius is a great introduction into Khan's music. Both critics give the album a {tag: Buy It} rating.
