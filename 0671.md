{artist: Noname} is a rapper whose poetic roots shine on her debut studio album, {album: Room 25}. According to {host: Greg}, each listen to the album reveals new meaning. {host: Jim} notes that though this is the 26 year old rapper's first studio album, she's given us material for years through her many collaborations with other young artists out of the new {place: Chicago} school of hip-hop, including {artist: Chance The Rapper}, {artist: Donnie Trumpet}, and {artist: Saba}, as well as through her well-received first mixtape, {album: Telefone}. This album finds her collaborating with up-and-comer {artist: Phoelix} on production which, according to Greg, results in a {genre: 1990s} {genre: East Coast hip hop} sound. Jim adds that the vibe of the record is also reminiscent of artists like {artist: Common} and {artist: D'Angelo} (he notes that D'Angelo even gets a shoutout on the track "{track: Don't Forget About Me}." {album: Room 25} marks a coming of age for Noname, and for both Jim and Greg, it proves that Noname is among the most exciting female voices in hip hop today.
