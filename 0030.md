## 00:01:50 Interview: Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood
This week on the show, Jim and Greg have two very special guests: {name: Thom Yorke} and {name: Jonny Greenwood} of the band {artist: Radiohead}. Our hosts consider Radiohead one of the most important bands of the past two decades, and were thrilled to have the lead singer and guitarist/multi-instrumentalist on the show. Greg asserts that {album: Kid A} is the most {genre: avant-garde} album to ever debut at the top of the {tag: Billboard} charts -- it's rare that a band can be so experimental and still achieve such mainstream success. 

Radiohead was in {place: Chicago} to perform two shows at the Auditorium Theatre, and when they come to town, it is always memorable. Their 2001 outdoor performance at Hutchinson Field was a landmark event for Chicago music. Though the city has not always been eager to invite droves of young rockers into its public spaces, the success of that show seems to have paved the way for outdoor music concerts like {tag: Lollapalooza}. Nevertheless, the Brits' return to the city this year was not completely drama free. The city rejected the band's bid to play at Millennium Park, although it's not clear whether or not Radiohead would have even accepted. Never one to do the same thing twice, the band was eager to try out a smaller, indoor venue like the {place: Auditorium Theatre}.

Thom and Jonny explain that this tour was an opportunity to work on songs that may be a part of their upcoming 2007 release. That's good news, since some suspected that there might not even be a next album. Radiohead's extended family keeps growing, as does their interest in solo work, so there was speculation that they might not continue in this incarnation. But unlike bands of their stature who stay together for the sake of the business, the bandmates explain that Radiohead will go on as long as the music makes it worth it. And in the meantime, they'll have to juggle the music with the [nappies](http://www.nappies.net/).

Doing solo projects is still a priority for members of Radiohead. Jonny composed the music for the 2004 film {tag: Bodysong}, which he also co-produced. And {artist: Thom Yorke} will be releasing {album: The Eraser} in July, though he explains that the term "solo" is not really appropriate in this case. The album was produced and arranged by longtime Radiohead collaborater {name: Nigel Godrich}, and contains music composed by his bandmates. 

One of the songs on {album: The Eraser}, "{track: Harrowdown Hill}," was inspired by the [death](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kelly_(weapons_expert) of weapons inspector and government scientist {name: Dr. David Kelly}. After acting as a whistle-blower and telling a journalist that he disagreed with claims the British government made about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, Kelly was found dead only days later. A Parliamentary committee investigated the death and determined it to be suicide, but many, including Thom, are skeptical of the validity of this finding. It's not the first time Thom and the band have infused their music with political meaning -- though, as Thom explains to Jim and Greg, his approach differs from that of his fellow [countryman](http://www.atu2.com/band/bono/).

## 00:45:29 Review: Nelly Furtado
![Loose](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/72/01/d4/7201d4b5-e761-2fe1-8c7c-27430a0df233/source/600x600bb.jpg "1260160/159916559")

Up for review this week is {album: Loose}, the third album from singer {artist: Nelly Furtado}. She had breakout success with her {era: 2000} record {album: Whoa, Nelly!}, featuring the hit single, "{track: I'm Like a Bird}." But she had less luck with her second album, {album: Folklore}, so on this go-around, Furtado sought out acclaimed producer {name: Timbaland}. Our critics disagree about the results. Jim finds her newly sexed-out image manufactured and unoriginal. He misses her more adventurous approach to music that incorporated {genre: pop} with {genre: worldbeat} and {genre: folk}. Basically, {host: Jim} finds Nelly to be a "skanky ho." That said, he does appreciate the {genre: Latin} songs on {album: Loose}, and her ballad with {artist: Coldplay}'s {name: Chris Martin}. For {host: Greg}, these are the worst songs on the album. He prefers the irresistible dance numbers "{track: Promiscuous}" and "{track: Maneater}," which are full of Timbaland's signature grooves. Greg questions why Jim is upset by a woman being overtly sexual, and explains that he finds her lyrics flirtatious, playful and ultimately harmless. Both critics give {album: Loose} a {tag: Burn It} -- for very different reasons.

## 00:54:10 DIJ: Jim
Jim's {tag: Desert Island Jukebox} pick this week is inspired by his conversation with Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood of {artist: Radiohead}. The band uses live performances as opportunities to explore and expand tracks they work on in the studio. This reminds Jim of the touring tactics of another great British band: {artist: Pink Floyd}. They too would road-test songs for months at a time before taking them to the studio. And the result is similar: Both Radiohead and Pink Floyd are simultaneously experimental, avant-garde and also successful in the mainstream, a rare combination in the music industry. So Jim decides to add a track that Pink Floyd experimented with live, then later recorded in a different format. The song fans know as "{track: Sheep}" from the {era: 1977} album {album: Animals}, was originally performed live as "{track: Raving and Drooling}." Listen to the studio version, then compare it to this rare DIJ pick.
