# Show 112: Unsung Heroes of Rock
Unsung Heroes: In rock and roll, it's usually the biggest personalities who get the most attention. So this week on the show, Jim and Greg will celebrate the little guy and showcase the "Unsung Heroes" of rock.

## 00:01:45 Intro: Music News
If you were one of the unfortunate few to tune in to last week's {tag: Golden Globes} "ceremony" then you know first hand how the {tag: Writer's Guild} strike can affect awards season. Now it appears the {tag: Grammy Awards} might be next to fall. The Recording Academy is seeking an interim agreement from the WGA to insure that the Feb. 10th awards broadcast will go off without a hitch. While they have gotten support from other industry unions, a WGA spokesperson didn't recommend betting on a waiver. {host: Jim}, for one, would welcome a trimmed down Grammy Awards. But, {host: Greg} doesn't think that audiences will tune in without the promise of star power. The one upside -- perhaps this year the Grammys will actually be about music.

By next year {tag: Live Nation} will not only have severed ties with {tag: Ticketmaster}, but become its biggest competition. The concert promoters, turned music moguls, announced plans to launch their own ticketing company. Therefore, they'll have their hands in every aspect of the music industry: production, marketing and sales of both albums and concert tickets. According to Jim and Greg, this brings up a lot of ethical issues that make them question how the consumer will be served. Ticketmaster is also blurring the lines of business; the company made its own announcement regarding the purchase of {tag: TicketsNow}. That website is the second-largest site in the secondary-ticket market behind {tag: StubHub}. Ticketmaster has been criticizing these kinds of brokers for years, but...if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. As Jim and Greg explain, now there isn't a lot stopping Ticketmaster from withholding a large quantity of tickets from the first round of sales, only to jack up the prices and make a huge profit the second time around.

The other big area of competition is turning out to be the summer concert festivals. The concert promoters behind {tag: Coachella} Valley Music and Arts Festival in {place: California} are headed east to set up shop in {place: New Jersey}. The Liberty State Park event will be held on August 8-10 -- the same exact dates as the {tag: Vineland} Music Festival. That event is being put on by the promoters behind {tag: Lollapalooza} and {tag: Austin City Limits}. Can New Jersey handle two 3-day concert festivals with a similarly diverse bill of hundreds of bands? Jim and Greg think no. The stage is set for "a blood bath" between the two corporate giants, but the real victims are probably going to be music fans.

From the concert wars to the real war... In an effort to boost morale, the {tag: U.S. Army} has put out a request for a "professional rock band." Following suit with the {tag: National Guard}, who used {artist: 3 Doors Down} to help them recruit moviegoers, the Army is looking to get a little more rock and roll. Or rather, {genre: Southern Rock}, {genre: Pop Rock}, {genre: Post-Grunge} or {genre: Hard Rock}. If you play these genres of music and are some kind of celebrity, national or local, and also don't mind suiting up in kevlar and being shipped off to {place: Kuwait} or {place: Afghanistan}, then submit your "proposal" today. Sound Opinions H.Q. can think of a few music celebs they'd nominate to be shipped off.

Next up Jim and Greg warn you to get ready for a full-blown {artist: Michael Jackson} revival. That's right, the man who many of us reduced to an E! True Hollywood Story may actually return to being an important music figure. A 25th anniversary edition of {album: Thriller} is scheduled for release next month, and {name: Jermaine Jackson} has said that his brother will be joining the rest of the {artist: Jackson 5} for a reunion tour later this year. But kicking the revival off is rapper {artist: Rhymefest}, who just posted a free download of {album: The Michael Jackson Dedication Album} on his website. The album was produced entirely with Jackson song samples, as well as inventive skits featuring the rapper and his pop idol. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} both recommend listeners check the album out, with Greg adding that it's the best thing {name: Michael Jackson} has had his name on in two decades. Rhymefest fans should also check out [his appearance on the show](/show/33/).

## 00:21:45 List: Unsung Heroes of Rock
Now it's time to hail the Unsung Heroes of Rock. The Micks and Bonos of the world may get all the acclaim, but it's often the little guy who deserves much of the credit. Jim and Greg have gone through the rock canon to honor these lesser-known musicians.

#### Jerome Green
Without {artist: Bo Diddley}, there wouldn't be a {artist: Mick Jagger} as we know it. And without {artist: Jerome Green}, there wouldn't have been a {artist: Bo Diddley}. His maracas helped to create Diddley's signature "shuffling freight train" sound, and his cool attitude helped to create the performers signature style -- one that would be emulated by many. 

#### Hal Blaine
{name: [Hal] Blaine} is responsible for one of the most famous drum intros in {genre: rock}. Just listen to "{track: Be My Baby}," by {artist: The Ronettes}, and you'll hear how Blaine is as important to that era's sound as producer {name: Phil Spector} was.

#### Ben "Bosstone" Carr
There's a history of {tag: go-go} dancers in rock, but of course, they're hard to showcase on the radio. Jim thinks {name: Ben "Bosstone" Carr} deserves credit for bringing style and maniacal energy to the band.

#### Augie Myers
The name might have you drawing a blank, but {name: [Augie] Myers} is a critical figure in rock. Greg is most impressed by how his {tag: vox continental organ} managed to add a greasy, {place: Texas} sound to what was essentially another imitation {genre: British invasion} band.

#### John Paul Jones
{name: John Paul Jones} deserves credit simply for keeping his own among the three biggest figures and egos in rock. He could pretty much play anything he got his hands on, but it was with the bass on songs like "{track: Black Dog}," that he really shone.

#### Ringo Starr
Onto a man who was easily the least important member of a very important band. Or so you might think. Jim says he'll fight anyone who underplays his drumming. He was never a show-off, allowing the vocals and guitars to shine when they needed to. But when there was an opportunity to come to the center, {name: [Ringo] Starr} accepted the challenge. Jim's been trying to master the drumming in "{track: Rain}" since he was a kid.

#### James Jamerson
The {genre: Motown} band members weren't even given credits on most of the songs they played on, but the reason you "move your butt" to most of those songs is because of {name: James Jamerson}. He not only played rhythm, but bass melodies, injecting a whole new style into rock.

#### Malcolm Young
With his knickers and beanie, everyone recognizes younger brother {name: Angus [Young]}. But, it was {name: Malcom [Young]} who gave {artist: AC/DC} their signature riffs. And one of their best, and one of the best in all of rock music according to Greg, is "{track: Highway to Hell}."
