## 00:00:45 Review: Alvvays

![Alvvays Blue Rev](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/886/193.jpg)

Canadian indie pop band {artist: Alvvays} [Always] recently released their third album, {album: Blue Rev}. It adds more shoegaze influence to their catchy songwriting for what Jim calls their strongest album. Greg admires the harder edge compared to their previous albums.

## 00:08:04 Review: Makaya McCraven

![Makaya McCraven In These Times](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/886/DG12.jpg)

Percussionist {artist: Makaya McCraven}’s new album {album: In These Times} goes beyond the genre label of jazz. The title references the post-production manipulation of time signatures McCraven did after recording live sessions with a group of top tier musicians. 

## 00:14:48 Interview: Nnamdï

![NNAMD Please Have a Seat](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/886/OO3.jpg)

{artist: Nnamdï} is a Chicago artist who is not constrained by genre. The multi-instrumentalist is a whirlwind of musical creativity and his latest album {album: Please Have A Seat} could be his best yet. Jim and Greg talk about his inspirations and their common interest in Looney Tunes composer Carl Stalling.
