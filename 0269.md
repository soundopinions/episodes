## 00:01:53 News: 01-21-2011
A group of musicians led by the estate of {genre: jazz} musician {artist: Chet Baker} filed a lawsuit against the four major record labels in {place: Canada}. The labels were using artists' songs for compilation albums, but had yet to pay any {tag: royalties}. Now they're paying up to the tune of $47 million.

Music publisher and television host {name: Don Kirshner} died this week at age 76. Kirshner began his career in music at the {tag: Brill Building}, working with songwriters and producers like {artist: Carole King} and {artist: Phil Spector}. He then developed bubblegum acts {artist: The Monkees} and {artist: The Archies} before going on to host *{tag: Don Kirshner's Rock Hour}* in 1973. {host: Greg} and {host: Jim} both fondly remember watching Kirshner's stiff, deadpan intros to that era's great acts including {artist: Kiss}, {artist: Led Zeppelin} and {artist: Sly and the Family Stone}. To pay homage to Kirshner, Jim and Greg choose to play {artist: Blue Oyster Cult}'s "{track: Marshall Plan}," which features a sample of an intro by Kirshner.

## 00:09:24 Interview: Superchunk
It's a cliché to say it, but when you look up "{tag: indie rock}," you do in fact see a photo of {artist: Superchunk}. Since forming in 1989, the {place: North Carolina} quartet have helped establish indie rock's {tag: DIY} model, as well as its sound. Superchunk {tag: bassist} {name: Laura Ballance} and {tag: guitarist} {name: Mac McCaughan} also founded {label: Merge Records}, one of the music industry's most successful {tag: indie} labels. The label is still home to the band, as well as {artist: The Arcade Fire}, {artist: Spoon} and {artist: Teenage Fanclub}. Mac, Laura and bandmates {name: Jim Wilbur} and {name: Jon Wurster} talk with {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} about how they've done it their way for so long. They also perform songs from their most recent release {album: Majesty Shredding}.

## 00:43:05 Review: The Decemberists
![The King Is Dead](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music4/v4/0c/0f/4d/0c0f4d43-cd3a-03e9-cbd9-40b12d1f943d/source/600x600bb.jpg "3205453/715554884")
Since 2004, {artist: The Decemberists} have evolved into full-blown theatricality. Now they scale it back with their sixth album {album: The King is Dead}. According to {host: Jim}, it's with this record that they silence critics of their prog antics and prove at their heart they're simply about great songwriting. Lead singer {name: Colin Meloy} and the band looked to American {genre: folk} and {genre: roots} music and enlisted {artist: R.E.M.}'s {name: Peter Buck} for a track. {host: Greg} finds the results more straightforward. *The King is Dead* shows that less is more and gets a double {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:50:12 DIJ: Jim
{host: Jim} gets to pop a quarter in the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox} this week, and he admits his choice is more about him than the music. He hates moving – especially in January in Chicago. The boxes and boxes of music books, records, CDs and even cassettes don't make the task any easier. But on the upside, Jim explains, he could finally set up his turntable again. He christened his new place by throwing on the vinyl of {album: Sticky Fingers} by the {artist: Rolling Stones}, and despite all the stress of moving, everything felt better. Jim even enjoyed the skipping during the album's second track "{track: Sway}", so he decided to add it to his desert island collection.
