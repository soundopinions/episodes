## 00:00:00 Feature: Alligator Records

Jim and Greg talk to Alligator Records founder Bruce Iglauer. They'll talk to him about his book Bitten By the Blues: The Alligator Records Story, and discuss some of the landmark artists who’ve recorded for the label over its nearly 50 years of existence, from Koko Taylor to Albert Collins. 


## 00:00:00 Interview: Buddy Guy

Jim and Greg will also revisit their 2007 interview with Chicago blues legend Buddy Guy. He’s known for his violent, high-energy style. This style wasn’t appreciated by his former label Chess Records, but was adored and emulated by British blues fans like Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck and Andy Summers. Buddy also performs a rare acoustic set.
