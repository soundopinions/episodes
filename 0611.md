## 00:01:45 Review: Vic Mensa
![The Autobiography](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music117/v4/b9/90/3a/b9903acc-e701-a4db-6943-6530918d6109/source/600x600bb.jpg "598667873/1256931190")

This week, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} review {album: The Autobiography}, the debut album by {place: Chicago} rapper {artist: Vic Mensa} – a name already familiar around Chicago , with fans including {artist: Chance The Rapper} and {artist: Kanye West}. Mensa raps with a "genre-free approach to what {genre: hip hop} is" while addressing his upbringing, his experiences with violence and drugs, and his own self-abuse - causing Greg to describe the record as brutally honest and "very emo."  Jim and Greg applaud producer {name: No I.D.} both for recognizing Mensa's artistic abilities and for producing a succinct album, rather than a bunch of singles.  While Jim and Greg note that Mensa definitely tries too hard with some of the lyrics, both agree that the album is "really impressive…and moving" and give it a double {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:11:43 Interview: Steve Earle
Singer/songwriter is no longer sufficient enough to describe the artistic output of {artist: Steve Earle}. The novelist, playwright, actor, activist AND singer/songwriter has released his 16th studio album, {album: So You Wannabe An Outlaw}. The record is a return to the {genre: outlaw country} sound he cut his teeth on, recording most of it on a 1955 Fender Telecaster while "shamelessly channeling {artist: Waylon Jennings}." Steve joined {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} at the Goose Island Tap Room in {place: Chicago} to perform a solo acoustic set and talk about his craft. "I realized that's what the job is…it's how we're the same, not how we're different…it's the universal things in these songs," says Steve of his job as a songwriter. In their wide ranging interview, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} talk with Steve about finding empathy in political songs, balancing life while on tour, the research that goes into his songs, and which cities have the best Mexican food (sorry, Austin).
