## 00:02:02 News: 07.10.09
After a two-year battle, a web royalty agreement has been reached that won't put webcasters out of business. In 2007 the {tag: copyright} royalty board ruled that webcasters needed to pay a fee of 0.08 cents each time a listener streamed wa song which would increase annually to 0.19 cents in 2015. That would've bankrupted many web music services like {tag: Pandora Radio}. Now, large webcasters must pay 25 percent of total revenue. 

{name: Michael Jackson}'s death is still making big news this week. Friends and family hosted a {tag: memorial tribute} to the late "King of Pop" on Tuesday. And Jackson's music continued to dominate the charts. In fact sales went up 90% with 800,000 albums sold. As {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} explain, this will go down as the last great week of physical album sales. And the good news continues for music retailersâ€“ a CD and DVD of both the memorial show and his tour rehearsals will be released this year.

A few weeks ago {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} talked about {name: Trent Reznor}'s involvement with heart patient {name: Eric De La Cruz}. Reznor asked {artist: Nine Inch Nails} fans to donate money toward a heart transplant in exchange for VIP access, special tickets and more. Unfortunately De La Cruz died last week before a transplant could take place. 

In other {artist: Nine Inch Nails} news, final tour dates have been announced for {place: Los Angeles}, {place: Chicago} and {place: New York}. As Reznor explained to Jim and Greg during their recent interview, this will be the last go-around for Nine Inch Nails, but certainly not the last of his music.

## 00:10:24 Interview: St. Vincent
This week {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} welcome singer and musician {name: Annie Clark}, otherwise known as {artist: St. Vincent}. After making a name for herself by touring and recording with {artist: Sufjan Stevens} and {artist: The Polyphonic Spree}, she recently released a second solo album called {album: Actor}. St. Vincent blew our hosts away at this year's {tag: SXSW} festival, and Greg is already calling *Actor* one of the best albums of the year. They were excited to have St. Vincent along with her band into the studio for a live performance and conversation about dirty tour buses, digital oboes and Disney cartoons.

## 00:40:22 Review: Maxwell
![BLACKsummers'night (Deluxe Version)](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music6/v4/5f/e1/6f/5fe16fd8-73b7-70ef-65de-42b3025c66b5/dj.zjbgrjpz.jpg/600x600bb-85.jpg "486768/321159421")

After breaking out of the {genre: neo-soul} movement along side {artist: Lauryn Hill} and {artist: D'Angelo}, singer {artist: Maxwell} took an almost decade-long hiatus. Now he is back with {album: BLACKsummers'night}. {host: Greg} likes that he doesn't hear anything trendy on this record. It reminds him of artier soul albums from the late '70s. The hooks aren't in abundance, but it's got grit. Greg gives Maxwell a {tag: Buy It} rating. {host: Jim} wishes he could be as enthusiastic. There are a couple of great songs, but for the most part he found the album sleepy. He wishes Maxwell threw a little more fire into {album: BLACKsummers'night} and gives it a {tag: Try It}.

## 00:48:09 DIJ: Greg
{artist: Maxwell} got Greg in the mood for some of that great soul music from the {era: late '70s} era. For him the British group {artist: Hot Chocolate} stands out from the rest. They had a big hit with "{track: You Sexy Thing}," but that track doesn't do them justice. Hot Chocolate came out of the {genre: ska} and {genre: reggae} tradition that emphasized great storytelling. You can hear this on the song "{track: Emma}," Greg's {tag: Desert Island Jukebox} addition for this week.
