# Show 491: The Rock Fan's Guide to Jazz

![jazz](http://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2015/jazz_web.jpg)

{genre: Jazz} is one of America's greatest cultural contributions. But with more than a century of music to explore, it can be hard for rock listeners to find their way in. Jazz writer {name: John Corbett} joins {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} to offer up the **{tag: Rock Fan's Guide to Jazz}**.


## 00:02:16 News: 04.24.15
{place: Norway} announced it will become the first country to switch off {name: FM Radio}. The {tag: FM} signal will be discontinued on January 11, 2017 and will shepherd in a digital a trend in {place: Europe}. Norway's Minister of Culture says the move will save the country $25 million a year. 

The {tag: IFPI} or International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, released a report called "Record Industry in Numbers" documenting the state of the music sales in 2014. Among the takeaways is that physical product is not dead, especially overseas. For example, in {place: Japan} and {place: Germany}, physical sales were 78% and 70% of overall sales. Also, global vinyl sales were up a massive 55% from 2013. {place: Latin America} was a growth sector for the industry: with digital revenues were up 32%, and even China, a hotbed of music piracy, showed promise when it came to legal sales. 


## 00:06:37 Special: Rock Fan's Guide to Jazz

If you've had trouble getting into {genre: jazz}, you are not alone – even {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} took a while to figure it out. Jazz is an iconic product of the {tag: African-American} experience, but there are a variety of barriers of entry that {genre: rock} listeners often have to overcome. To begin with, jazz has existed for twice as long as rock, meaning that there's an intimidating ocean of music to navigate. That's why we've enlisted the help of jazz writer and curator {name: John Corbett} to create the **{tag: Rock Fan's Guide to Jazz}**. John refutes the notion that jazz is "fuddy-duddy" music from a bygone era. Instead, it's an exhilarating, joyful genre that continues to develop today. 

There are many potential entry points to jazz that share certain sensibilities with rock music. The {genre: hard bop} stylings of {artist: Sonny Rollins}, for example, have a sense of forward propulsion familiar to rock fans. Even though some listeners think of {genre: swing} as polite, genteel music, John can cite examples of {artist: Duke Ellington} recordings that have the verve of any good rock guitar solo. Rock and jazz intersect in a very real sense in the {genre: jazz-fusion} records of {artist: Miles Davis} in the {era: late 1960s}. And bands from {artist: The Velvet Underground} to {artist: Sonic Youth} have drawn inspiration from the boundary-pushing {genre: free jazz} of {artist: Ornette Coleman} and {artist: Albert Ayler}. But jazz is really best appreciated live, so fortunately there are many exciting young jazz artists performing today who exhibit a {genre: punk rock} sensibility.

### John Corbett's jazz recommendations for rock listeners 
- {artist: Sonny Rollins}, "{track: Strode Rode}" from {album: Saxophone Colossus}
- {artist: Luis Russell & His Orchestra}, "{track: The (New) Call of the Freaks}"
- {artist: Duke Ellington}, "{track: Concerto for Cootie}"
- {artist: Miles Davis}, "{track: Miles Runs the Voodoo Down}" from {album: Bitches Brew}
- {artist: Ornette Coleman}, "{track: Voice Poetry}" from {album: Body Meta}

## 00:49:36 DIJ: Jim
There's no better desert island track for the {genre: Rock} Fan's Guide to {genre: Jazz} than "{track: Starship}" by {artist: MC5}. "Starship" comes from the band's debut album {album: Kick Out the Jams} and showcases its musical influences. The perfect merger between the two genres, the godfathers of {genre: punk} took a poem by jazz icon {name: Sun Ra} and turned it into a song. This eight minute long track exemplifies a wild {genre: free jazz} experience where the band is leaving the earth and the stage. For {host: Jim} and many others, MC5 was a gateway for rock fans to jazz. Do you have a question, comment or suggestion? Contact us [here](http://soundopinions.org/about).
