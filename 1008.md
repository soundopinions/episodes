## 00:00:00 Review: Bartees Strange
{artist : Bartees Strange} is a compelling, shape-shifting musician back with his third album in five years, “{album : Horror}.” Despite some production work from Jack Antonoff, the hosts have generally positive feelings about the album, though they agree it is not Strange’s best work.
