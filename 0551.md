## 00:44:16 Review: Paul Simon

![Stranger to Stranger (Deluxe Edition)](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/551/21S0.jpg)

After his success with {artist : Simon & Garfunkel} and as a solo artist, it would be easy for {artist : Paul Simon} to rest on his laurels. But Simon has continued to push himself with new ideas and rhythms. His 13th solo album is {album : Stranger to Stranger}, and it finds Simon using some of the weird home-made instruments of legendary experimental composer {name : Harry Partch}, and collaborating with Italian {genre : electronic dance} artist {artist : Clap! Clap!}. {host : Greg} appreciates that Simon is an artist that continues to innovate. He likes both the humor and the references to mortality (without being morbid) that the now 74-year-old throws into the lyrics. {host : Jim} is less impressed, feeling that Simon's work radiates an annoying self-satisfaction. Jim admits that Simon works with rhythms well but believes he is giving the illusion of doing something new, rather than actually doing something new. It's a {tag : Buy It} for *Stranger to Stranger* from Greg and a {tag : Try It} for Jim.



## 00:50:43 DIJ: Greg

When {genre : outlaw country} legend {artist : Merle Haggard} died in April of this year, many obituaries focused on his huge 1969 hit "{track : Okie From Muskogee}."  It was a divisive song from a contentious time in U.S. history. Many took it as a flag-waving anthem that mocked the counterculture. Haggard himself changed his tune many times regarding whether he personally agreed with the lyrics or not.  What {host : Greg} finds interesting is that the single Haggard wanted to put out following "Okie From Muskogee" was "{track : Irma Jackson}," a song in defense of interracial romance. The record company "suits" wouldn't release it, believing it would alienate his new fans. Three years later, Haggard finally got his way and the single was released. Greg believes Haggard was finally able to show that he was much more than the one-dimensional character in "Okie." And that's why he selected "Irma Jackson" to take to the {tag : Desert Island Jukebox} today.
