![eno](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2024/tigermountaineno.jpeg)
Over the long tenure of Sound Opinions, hosts Jim DeRogatis and Greg Kot mentioned Brian Eno countless times. They think it's time to tackle a classic album dissection of his 1974 record Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy.) They discuss Eno's career before and since the album, as well as hear a bit of Eno himself from their 2011 interview with him.

This week, hosts Jim DeRogatis and Greg Kot undertake a classic album dissection by popular demand from listeners- {artist : Brian Eno}’s second solo album, “{album : Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)}.” Eno’s name comes up often enough on Sound Opinions that it’s often marked with a ding from the “Eno bell,” but this is the first classic album dissection they’ve ever done of an Eno album.
