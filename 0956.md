# Show 956: Brian Eno's Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)



## 00:00:00 Intro: Coming Soon

Over the long tenure of Sound Opinions, hosts Jim DeRogatis and Greg Kot mentioned Brian Eno countless times. They think it's time to tackle a classic album dissection of his 1974 record Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy.) They discuss Eno's career before and since the album, as well as hear a bit of Eno himself from their 2011 interview with him.
