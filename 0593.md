## 00:01:20 Interview: Mavis Staples

It's not often we get to share a room with a genuine national treasure. {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} were honored to speak with {genre : gospel} and {genre : soul} legend and Civil Rights icon {artist : Mavis Staples}. (Greg is also the author of Mavis's 2014 biography [*I'll Take You There*](http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Ill-Take-You-There/Greg-Kot/9781451647860)). Beginning her career at age eleven as the lead singer of her family band {artist : The Staple Singers}, Mavis has inspired countless artists over the past half century.

Her father {name : Pops Staples} learned guitar at the feet of {artist : Charley Patton} in {place : Dockery Farms}, {place : Mississippi} before moving to {place : Chicago}. There, he formed The Staple Singers, a gospel vocal group featuring his children – {name : Pervis [Staples]}, {name : Cleotha [Staples]}, {name : Yvonne [Staples]}, and Mavis taking the lead. The combination of Pops's {genre : blues} guitar, Cleotha's counterpoint, and Mavis's precociously powerful voice launched them into national attention with their 1956 hit "{track : Uncloudy Day}." Soon, the Staple Singers were at the forefront of the {tag : Civil Rights Movement}, often serving as the opening act to {name : Martin Luther King, Jr.} (We'll cover that period in more detail in a second episode with Mavis).

The group had its greatest success once it signed to {label : Stax} Records and began recording with the famed session musicians in {place : Muscle Shoals}, {place : Alabama} on hits like "{track : I'll Take You There}." That's also when Mavis began her solo career – reluctantly at first, but still going as strong as ever today. Her latest album {album : Livin' on a High Note} found her working with songwriters like {artist : Nick Cave}, {artist : tUnE-yArDs}, and {artist : Neko Case}. Mavis offers Jim and Greg an intimate look at growing up on Chicago's South Side, forming the Staple Singers' signature sound, meeting {artist : Mahalia Jackson}, and collaborating with {artist : Curtis Mayfield} and {artist : Prince}.
