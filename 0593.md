## 00:01:20 Interview: Mavis Staples
It's not often we get to share a room with a genuine national treasure. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} were honored to speak with {genre: gospel} and {genre: soul} legend and Civil Rights icon {artist: Mavis Staples}. (Greg is also the author of Mavis's 2014 biography [*I'll Take You There*](http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Ill-Take-You-There/Greg-Kot/9781451647860)). Beginning her career at age eleven as the lead singer of her family band {artist: The Staple Singers}, Mavis has inspired countless artists over the past half century.

Her father {name: Pops Staples} learned guitar at the feet of {artist: Charley Patton} in {place: Dockery Farms}, {place: Mississippi} before moving to {place: Chicago}. There, he formed The Staple Singers, a gospel vocal group featuring his children – {name: Pervis [Staples]}, {name: Cleotha [Staples]}, {name: Yvonne [Staples]}, and Mavis taking the lead. The combination of Pops's {genre: blues} guitar, Cleotha's counterpoint, and Mavis's precociously powerful voice launched them into national attention with their 1956 hit "{track: Uncloudy Day}." Soon, the Staple Singers were at the forefront of the {tag: Civil Rights Movement}, often serving as the opening act to {name: Martin Luther King, Jr.} (We'll cover that period in more detail in a second episode with Mavis).

The group had its greatest success once it signed to {label: Stax} Records and began recording with the famed session musicians in {place: Muscle Shoals}, {place: Alabama} on hits like "{track: I'll Take You There}." That's also when Mavis began her solo career – reluctantly at first, but still going as strong as ever today. Her latest album {album: Livin' on a High Note} found her working with songwriters like {artist: Nick Cave}, {artist: tUnE-yArDs}, and {artist: Neko Case}. Mavis offers Jim and Greg an intimate look at growing up on Chicago's South Side, forming the Staple Singers' signature sound, meeting {artist: Mahalia Jackson}, and collaborating with {artist: Curtis Mayfield} and {artist: Prince}.
