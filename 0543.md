# Show 543: Earth Day, TV Tunes, & Opinions on Parquet Courts

![Earth Day](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2016/earthday_web.jpg)

Like all human activity, even {genre: rock} music has an ecological impact. On this {tag: Earth Day}, environmentalist {name: Bill McKibben} and musician/activist {name: Adam Gardner} join {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} for a discussion about the complicated relationship between music and the {tag: environment}. Jim and Greg also talk to {tag: music supervisor} {name: Randall Poster} about bringing tunes to the big and small screens.


## 00:01:33 News: 04.22.16
![Vinyl](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2016/vinyl.jpg)
Recently, {tag: HBO} aired the season one finale of their new record industry drama, {tag: *Vinyl*}. The series comes from executive producers {name: Martin Scorsese} and {name: Mick Jagger}, and stars {name: Bobby Cannavale} as a struggling label head in {era: 1970s} {place: New York City}. While the reviews have been mixed, one thing everyone can agree on is this show knows and loves its music. That's in large part to its music supervisor {tag: Randall Poster}. 

Poster is a frequent collaborator with Martin Scorsese on projects like *The Aviator*, *The Wolf of Wall Street* and *Boardwalk Empire*. He also often works with {name: Wes Anderson} on films from *Rushmore* to *The Grand Budapest Hotel*. We spoke with Randall Poster about the music for this season of *Vinyl* and his other projects.


## 00:19:40 Special: Rock & the Environment
![Bill McKibben](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2016/bill_mckibben_web.jpg)
Musicians have effectively protested {tag: war}, the {tag: AIDS} crisis, and {tag: nuclear energy}. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} have talked about the central role music played in the [Civil Rights Movement](/show/534/). But with global temperatures rising, are artists doing their part in battling {tag: climate change}? To examine {genre: rock}'s relationship with the {tag: environment} this {tag: Earth Day}, we're joined by environmentalist {name: Bill McKibben}. Not only is Bill an author, scholar at {place: Middlebury College}, and co-founder of the grassroots climate organization {tag: 350.org}, he's also a noted rock fan. They discuss the carbon footprint of the music industry from festivals to touring to recorded music manufacturing. But Bill argues the deeper problem is that musicians haven't adequately become part of the movement to influence culture through writing songs about the environment. But Bill, Jim, and Greg highlight the handful of successful environmental protest songs that do exist, from {artist: Joni Mitchell} to {artist: Dr. Octagon}.

One musician who's taking an active role in fighting climate change from within the industry is {name: Adam Gardner}, guitarist/vocalist for {artist: Guster}. He's also the co-founder of {tag: REVERB}, a non-profit dedicated to making bands' tours more sustainable, working with {artist: Alabama Shakes}, {artist: Willie Nelson}, {artist: Dave Matthews Band}, and more. Adam also discusses REVERB's efforts to raise awareness of how {tag: endangered woods} illegally make their way into our guitars.


## 00:46:54 Review: Parquet Courts
![Human Performance](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/543/2660.jpg)

{genre: Indie rock} four-piece {artist: Parquet Courts} formed in {place: Brooklyn} in 2010 with three of its members originally from {place: Texas}. They debuted with a limited cassette release in 2011, but it wasn't until they released {album: Light Up Gold} in 2012 that they really turned some heads. The record was reissued on a bigger label in 2013, and after releasing two semi-official albums, Parquet Courts is back with {album: Human Performance}. 
  
{host: Greg} thinks Parquet Courts have captured what it's like living in {place: New York City}—isolating and overwhelming at once. This mood hangs over the whole record, even during what he calls the back-and-forth conversations between {name: Andrew Savage} and {name: Austin Brown}. Savage writes melancholy break-up tunes, and Brown responds with optimism. Greg thinks that while the record does not reach the masterpiece-status of *Light Up Gold*, it's a {tag: Buy It} nonetheless.

{host: Jim} agrees that it's a {tag: Buy It}, loving the jaunty piano, droning organ and sound effects. He recalls Parquet Courts being referred to by critics as slackers on their last album, sparked in no small part by the song "{track: Stoned and Starving}," but Jim clarifies that there's nothing lazy about their songwriting and thinks "{track: Dust}" is a brilliant track. Jim nods to the dialogue between Brown and Savage, but finds even more compelling the rapport between their guitars.
