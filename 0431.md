# Show 431: Sly & the Family Stone, Oscar Songs and Lydia Loveless

![Sly & the Family Stone](http://static.soundopinions.org/images/2014/sly_web.jpg)

 {name: Jerry Martini} and {name: Cynthia Robinson} of {artist: Sly & the Family Stone} talk about the band's funk innovation, radical politics and Sly's magnetic power. Plus, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} roll out the {tag: Oscar} red carpet and review a new album from the {genre: alt-country} {genre: singer/songwriter} {artist: Lydia Loveless}.


## 00:02:20 News: 02.28.14
Former {artist: LCD Soundsystem} frontman {name: James Murphy} has been keeping busy since the group disbanded in 2011. When not [scoring Broadway plays](show/414/) and [roasting speciality coffee](http://www.bluebottlecoffee.com/products/house-of-good), he's taking on {place: New York City}'s notoriously noisy {tag: subway} system. Murphy wants to change the soulless beeps made by current subway turnstiles into melodic notes that harmonize and respond to the amount of traffic passing through the station. Murphy [first revealed](https://soundcloud.com/soundopinions/james-murphy-on-his-dream-nyc) this plan to {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} last year, but now he's making his campaign public. So far, {place: New York City}'s {tag: Metropolitan Transit Authority} isn't particularly warm to the idea, citing the significant cost and time, but Murphy remains undetered. 

The good news for costumed rockers {artist: Kiss} is that they'll be inducted into {tag: The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame} in April. The bad news is that the band won't be compromising it's creative integrity (a first, Jim says) by performing at the induction ceremony in its current iteration (which excludes original members {name: Ace Freely} and {name: Peter Criss}). With bad blood between Freely, Criss, and {name: Gene Simmons}, there's no hope for a make-up in time for the ceremony. But, Jim thinks purist Kiss fans would probably prefer to see no show than a show without the original Spaceman and Catman. 


## 00:07:01 Interview: Cynthia Robinson and Jerry Martini of Sly & the Family Stone
In the {genre: 1960's}, {artist: Sly & the Family Stone}, with its multi-racial, co-ed lineup, broke down barriers of how a band should look and sound. It also bridged {genre: rock}, {genre: funk}, {genre: R&B}, {genre: soul} and {genre: jazz}, thanks in large part to its virtuoso musicians: {tag: guitarist} {name: Freddie Stone}, {tag: bass} player {name: Larry Graham}, {tag: drummer} {name: Greg Errico}, {tag: keys player} {name: Rose Stone}, {tag: trumpeter} {name: Cynthia Robinson} and {tag: sax player} {name: Jerry Martini}. Then, of course, you have {name: Sly Stone}, one of the most charismatic frontmen in music history. But, once the charming star who stole the show at {tag: Woodstock} and on {tag: Dick Cavett}, Sly Stone dropped out of public life in {era: 1975}. We've had occasional glimpses since then, but for the most part his legend only lives on in recordings. Luckily fans have a new box set called *{album: Higher!}* Upon its release, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} spoke with Cynthia Robinson and Jerry Martini.

## 00:38:24 Review: Oscar Songs 2014
![pharrelloscars](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2014/pharrelloscars.jpg)
When it comes to movies, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} defer to the {tag: Academy}. But, when it comes to music, they aren't as casual. {era: 2014} has been a banner year for {genre: pop} music in the movies, with three of this year's {tag: Best Original Song} nominees topping the charts. In fact, this kind of crossover hasn't happened since {era: 1984}, when all five nominees hit #1. First, there's {artist: Idina Menzel}'s ubiquitous "{track: Let It Go}," from the animated {tag: Disney} hit {tag: *Frozen*}. Written by {name: Robert Lopez} and {name: Kristen Anderson-Lopez} of {tag: *Book of Mormon*} fame, it's a flashy show tune—the "{artist: Diane Warren} power ballad" of Greg's nightmares—that fails to impress our hosts. Not so with "{track: The Moon Song}," from the film {tag: *Her*}. {name: Karen O} of {artist: Yeah Yeah Yeahs}, who co-wrote the song with director {name: Spike Jonze}, has since released a duet with {name: Ezra Koenig} of {artist: Vampire Weekend}. This quiet, intimate tune wins Jim's statuette, even if it's too low-key for the Academy. 
{host: Greg}'s giving his award to "{track: Happy}" from {tag: *Despicable Me 2*}. While Mr. Kot admits to living under a rock when it comes to kids' movies, he considers {artist: Pharrell}'s single, with its layered vocals and handclaps, a pop masterpiece (despite the mediocre lyrics). {host: Jim} isn't as happy and thinks that {name: Pharrell [Williams]} phoned this one in. Meanwhile, {artist: U2} took a break from ending world hunger to record a new song for {tag: *Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom*}. While the film got little attention in the {place: U.S.}, "{track: Ordinary Love}" has something else working in its favor: the media empire of {name: Harvey Weinstein}. His aggressive promotion already won the song a {tag: Golden Globe} for Best Song, and could similarly sway the Academy...but not our hosts. Despite the noble subject, Jim and Greg just hear standard U2 flag-waving.

## 00:47:30 Review: Lydia Loveless
![Somewhere Else](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/e6/5a/79/e65a7966-f4da-839a-b036-7263cd121805/source/600x600bb.jpg "360720332/795321994")
At just 23, {artist: Lydia Loveless} already has three albums worth of romantic troubles, documented with amazing emotion. The latest, {album: Somewhere Else}, might be the best yet, according to {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}. Greg enjoys the way she arranges the songs in a slightly melancholic {genre: country} style. He was blown away by her last release, {album: Indestructible Machine} in {era: 2012} (especially the songs she performed in our [studio](http://www.soundopinions.org/show/348/)). But this album is a step above. Greg says {tag: Buy It}. {host: Jim} hears Loveless going all over the pop spectrum, name dropping {artist: Tommy Tutone} and pulling out a great cover of a song by the underrated {era: '90s} artist, {artist: Kirsty MacColl}. And throughout it all she maintains her own identity. He seconds the {tag: Buy It}.
