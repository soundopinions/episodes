## News: 11.28.08
00:01:44 A few months ago {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} reported that the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals had tossed out the {tag: FCC}'s indecency claim against {tag: CBS}. We thought that might be the end of "{tag: Nipplegate}," but now the FCC has announced it will take its case to the Supreme Court. Jim and Greg never thought they'd find themselves agreeing with CBS, but it agrees with the network's argument that sometimes there are just some slips you can't control.

## 00:03:40 Review: Kanye West
![808s & Heartbreak (Exclusive Edition)](//static.soundopinions.org/assets/157/640.jpg "2715720/778788809")
One of the albums making news this week is from {tag: rapper} {artist: Kanye West}. The {place: Chicago} native had planned to release a new album in his college series, but after the death of his mother and a bad breakup, he created an intensely personal album called {album: 808s and Heartbreak}. The 808 drum machine is used heavily, as is the Auto-Tune device. Those effects take some getting used to, but according to {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}, they are integral to creating the sense of introspection and loneliness. Jim appreciates the rapper's attempt to make an existential record, especially one inspired by {artist: Phil Collins}. He wishes there was more acoustic musicianship, but Jim finds 808s and Heartbreak to be fascinating and gives it a {tag: Buy It}. Greg agrees, calling the album one of the most personal released this year. He also gives it a Buy It.

## 00:13:10 List: Turkey Shoot 2008
On {tag: Thanksgiving} most Americans give thanks for things like their loved ones and their health. But at Sound Opinions we like to take this opportunity to give thanks of a different variety.

These are records that had great potential, but fell flat. Say farewell to the following Turkeys:

- {artist: My Morning Jacket}, {album: Evil Urges}
- {artist: Brian Wilson}, {album: That Lucky Old Sun}

## 00:38:18 Review: The Killers
![Day & Age (Deluxe Version)](//static.soundopinions.org/assets/157/1RU0.jpg "6483093/296905600")
On their 3rd album {album: Day & Age}, {artist: The Killers} have teamed up with {artist: Madonna} {tag: producer} {name: Stuart Price}, further confusing their identity. Are they {genre: Nu-New Wave}? Are they {genre: Nu-Springsteen}? Or {genre: Nu-Dance Pop}? {host: Greg}'s answer is that they are merely a great singles band. {name: Brandon Flowers} is not a great lyricist, but there are a handful of great, {genre: glam rock} pop songs on this new album, and together with the handful of other tracks from their previous albums, he predicts they'll have a hell of a compilation one day. But for now he gives {album: Day & Age} a {tag: Try It}. {host: Jim} is less kind. He finds the album over-produced and packed with the worst steel drums and saxophones he's heard in a long time. He gives it a {tag: Trash It}.

## 00:48:12 Review: Rivers Cuomo
![Alone, Vol. 2 - The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo](//static.soundopinions.org/assets/157/28C0.jpg "24938402/296874463")
The {artist: Weezer} album might have gotten a {tag: Turkey} vote from one of our listeners, but how does {tag: frontman} {artist: Rivers Cuomo} fare on his own? The singer just released {album: Alone Vol. 2 - The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo}, and according to {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} it's full of the heartfelt, intimate songs that fans of the {album: Blue Album} expect from {name: [Rivers] Cuomo}. Greg sees Weezer's recent songs as being written for the masses, while these are written from the heart. Whatever your take on Weezer is, both Jim and Greg give a {tag: Buy It} to The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo.
