## 00:33:20 Interview: Peter Lewis of Moby Grape

When {artist : Moby Grape} formed in {place : San Francisco} in {era : 1966}, some critics saw them as America's answer to {artist : The Beatles}. Their line-up was stacked with three talented guitarists ({artist : Skip Spence}, {artist : Peter Lewis} and {artist : Jerry Miller}) and all five band members sang lead and wrote songs (bassist {name : Bob Mosley} and drummer {name : Don Stevenson} rounded out the band). They could play radio-friendly music as well as {genre : psychedelic} experimental music. {label : Columbia Records} was excited to support them and it seemed there was nowhere to go but up. But before they could ascend to the top of the music industry, a string of bad luck got in their way.

This week, guitarist {name : Peter Lewis} explains to {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} how a bad manager, an overzealous publicity strategy and mental illness combined with a drug cocktail relegated Moby Grape to "{tag : buried treasure}" status, even 52 years after their debut album was released. He also talks about how they developed their three guitar approach, their friendship with {artist : Buffalo Springfield} and Skip Spence's solo album {album : Oar}, which he wrote over his six months in {place : Bellevue psychiatric hospital}.
