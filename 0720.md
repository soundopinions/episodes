## 00:33:20 Interview: Peter Lewis of Moby Grape
![Moby Grape](https://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2019/Moby_Grape.jpg)
When {artist: Moby Grape} formed in {place: San Francisco} in {era: 1966}, some critics saw them as America's answer to {artist: The Beatles}. Their line-up was stacked with three talented guitarists ({artist: Skip Spence}, {artist: Peter Lewis} and {artist: Jerry Miller}) and all five band members sang lead and wrote songs (bassist {name: Bob Mosley} and drummer {name: Don Stevenson} rounded out the band). They could play radio-friendly music as well as {genre: psychedelic} experimental music. {label: Columbia Records} was excited to support them and it seemed there was nowhere to go but up. But before they could ascend to the top of the music industry, a string of bad luck got in their way. 

This week, guitarist {name: Peter Lewis} explains to {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} how a bad manager, an overzealous publicity strategy and mental illness combined with a drug cocktail relegated Moby Grape to "{tag: buried treasure}" status, even 52 years after their debut album was released. He also talks about how they developed their three guitar approach, their friendship with {artist: Buffalo Springfield} and Skip Spence's solo album {album: Oar}, which he wrote over his six months in {place: Bellevue psychiatric hospital}.
