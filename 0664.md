On Thursday, August 16, {artist: Aretha Franklin}, "The Queen of Soul," died at the age of 76 in {place: Detroit}, her hometown. As an 18-time {tag: Grammy} recipient, the first woman to be inducted in the {tag: Rock & Roll Hall of Fame} in 1987, and one of the best-selling artists of all time, Franklin's achievements are staggering. But her legacy can't be quantified by mere numbers: Her remarkable discography—defined by that stunning four-octave voice—included songs that became anthems for social change. {genre: Gospel} critic {name: Anthony Heilbut} once asserted that Franklin's role in the {tag: Civil Rights Movement} was such that "a history of black America could well be divided into pre- and post-Aretha." {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} trace her extraordinary career, from her start singing in Detroit's New Bethel Baptist Church (where her father was a star preacher) to being signed with {label: Columbia} and {label: Atlantic Records}, to zeitgeist-defining performances at the 1998 Grammy Awards, {name: Barack Obama}'s 2009 Presidential Inauguration, and the 2015 {tag: Kennedy Center Honors}.
