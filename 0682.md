{host: Jim} gets to unleash his inner thirteen-year-old this week as he and {host: Greg} sit down with {name: Alex Lifeson} and {name: Geddy Lee} of the {place: Canadian} {genre: prog-rock} legends {artist: Rush}. All three members of Rush are known for their ridiculous virtuosity on their instruments â€“ {tag: drum} god {name: Neil Peart}, Lifeson on {tag: guitar}, and Geddy Lee, who manages to play bass and synths and sing simultaneously. Lee and Lifeson met in junior high in {place: Ontario} and released a couple {genre: hard rock} albums with drummer {name: John Rutsey} in the {era: early '70s}. But the band really hit its stride when Rutsey was replaced by Neil Peart, who also became the primary lyricist. They began crafting epic {genre: progressive rock} concept albums like {album: 2112} and {album: Hemispheres} featuring side-length {tag: sci-fi} suites. The albums {album: Permanent Waves} and {album: Moving Pictures} brought Rush radio hits in the {era: early '80s}, and the band moved into a synth-driven phase. Over the ensuing decades, Rush has continued to evolve its sound and adapt to new styles, while growing a cult fanbase that is intense to say the least. Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson discuss the band's evolving styles, the existence of female Rush fans, and more.

## 00:37:36 Obituary: Pete Shelley of the Buzzcocks

{artist: Pete Shelley}, the leader of the {artist: Buzzcocks}, died at home in {place: Estonia} of a heart attack on December 6, 2018. He was 63 years old. Shelley's work was a major influence on a wide swath of musicians over the past 40 years. {host: Greg} points out the {artist: Buzzcocks} were one of the first {genre: punk} bands to eschew the safety pins and mohawks aesthetic, showing the movement ran deeper than fashion trends. He calls them "the next generation's answer to {artist: The Beatles}." 
Shelley and Buzzcocks co-founder {name: Howard Devoto} put on the {artist: Sex Pistols}' first show outside of {place: London}. It turned out to be a confluence of the future of {place: Manchester}'s music scene with members of {artist: Joy Division} and {artist: The Smiths} in attendance as well as {label: Factory Records} founder {name: Anthony Wilson} and producer {name: Martin Hannett}. [It was recreated in the 2002 film, "24 Hour Party People."](http://www.criticalcommons.org/Members/brettservice/clips/24-hour-party-people-2002-sex-pistols-concert)

{host: Jim} points out the {artist: Buzzcocks}' devotion to {tag: melody} and describes their sound as "the Beatles catalog shoved into two minutes." He also recounts how Shelley's first solo single "{track: Homosapien}" was banned by the BBC for "racy" lyrics. Fans have often wondered if Shelley's early embrace of {genre: synth-pop} could have led to greater commercial success had the song been played on the radio. Jim plays "{track: Ever Fallen In Love (With Someone You Shouldn't've)}" as a tribute, calling it one of the greatest songs ever. Greg pays tribute by playing "{track: I Believe}," which Shelley closed many concert sets with and was an audience favorite.
