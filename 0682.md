Famous for its instrumental virtuosity and heady, sci-fi influenced lyrics, the Canadian {genre : prog-rock} trio {artist : Rush} has amassed an obsessive cult following. {artist : Geddy Lee} and {artist : Alex Lifeson} of Rush join {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} to discuss the band's remarkable 40 plus-year career. Jim and Greg will also say farewell to the leader of the {genre : punk} band the {artist : Buzzcocks}, {artist : Pete Shelley}, who died earlier in December at age 63.



## 00:01:35 Interview: Rush

![rush](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/682/2N0.jpg)

{host : Jim} gets to unleash his inner thirteen-year-old this week as he and {host : Greg} sit down with {name : Alex Lifeson} and {name : Geddy Lee} of the {place : Canadian}  {genre : prog-rock} legends {artist : Rush}. All three members of Rush are known for their ridiculous virtuosity on their instruments – {tag : drum} god {name : Neil Peart}, Lifeson on {tag : guitar}, and Geddy Lee, who manages to play bass and synths and sing simultaneously. Lee and Lifeson met in junior high in {place : Ontario} and released a couple {genre : hard rock} albums with drummer {name : John Rutsey} in the {era : early '70s}. But the band really hit its stride when Rutsey was replaced by Neil Peart, who also became the primary lyricist. They began crafting epic {genre : progressive rock} concept albums like {album : 2112} and {album : Hemispheres} featuring side-length {tag : sci-fi} suites. The albums {album : Permanent Waves} and {album : Moving Pictures} brought Rush radio hits in the {era : early '80s}, and the band moved into a synth-driven phase. Over the ensuing decades, Rush has continued to evolve its sound and adapt to new styles, while growing a cult fanbase that is intense to say the least. Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson discuss the band's evolving styles, the existence of female Rush fans, and more.



## 00:37:36 Obit: Pete Shelley



{artist : Pete Shelley}, the leader of the {artist : Buzzcocks}, died at home in {place : Estonia} of a heart attack on December 6, 2018. He was 63 years old. Shelley's work was a major influence on a wide swath of musicians over the past 40 years. {host : Greg} points out the {artist : Buzzcocks} were one of the first {genre : punk} bands to eschew the safety pins and mohawks aesthetic, showing the movement ran deeper than fashion trends. He calls them "the next generation's answer to {artist : The Beatles}."

Shelley and Buzzcocks co-founder {name : Howard Devoto} put on the {artist : Sex Pistols}' first show outside of {place : London}. It turned out to be a confluence of the future of {place : Manchester}'s music scene with members of {artist : Joy Division} and {artist : The Smiths} in attendance as well as {label : Factory Records} founder {name : Anthony Wilson} and producer {name : Martin Hannett}. [It was recreated in the 2002 film, "24 Hour Party People."](http://www.criticalcommons.org/Members/brettservice/clips/24-hour-party-people-2002-sex-pistols-concert)

{host : Jim} points out the {artist : Buzzcocks}' devotion to {tag : melody} and describes their sound as "the Beatles catalog shoved into two minutes." He also recounts how Shelley's first solo single "{track : Homosapien}" was banned by the BBC for "racy" lyrics. Fans have often wondered if Shelley's early embrace of {genre : synth-pop} could have led to greater commercial success had the song been played on the radio. Jim plays "{track : Ever Fallen In Love (With Someone You Shouldn't've)}" as a tribute, calling it one of the greatest songs ever. Greg pays tribute by playing "{track : I Believe}," which Shelley closed many concert sets with and was an audience favorite.
