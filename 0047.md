# Show 47: Funeral Songs & Goth Rock
With Halloween just around the corner, Jim and Greg decided to break out the black eyeliner and take a tour of the labyrinthian underground of Goth Rock. Plus, tune in to hear a morbid discussion of the best songs to play at your funeral.

![Funeral Songs](http://static.soundopinions.org/images/2006/funeralsongs.jpg)

## 00:02:50 News: 01.21.06
This week Jim and Greg get an early jump on their annual {tag: Halloween} celebration. What better way to start the show than with a completely morbid news story? According to a recent British [survey](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5398266.stm) conducted by the Bereavement Register, the number one song requested to be played at funerals is {artist: James Blunt}'s "{track: Goodbye My Lover}." We at Sound Opinions  had not previously heard this track, but after giving it a listen, we agree that only someone recently departed would enjoy it. 

## 00:03:56 List: Funeral Songs
The complete top five funeral songs, according to the Register:

- {artist: James Blunt}, "{track: Goodbye My Lover}"
- {artist: Robbie Williams}, "{track: Angels}" 
- {artist: Jennifer Warnes and Bill Medley}, "{track: I've Had the Time of My Life}" 
- {artist: Bette Midler}, "{track: Wind Beneath My Wings}" 
- ["{track: Pie Jesu}"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_Jesu)

We asked our Sound Opinions listeners this same, morbid question. Here are some of the "swan songs" you told us about via [email](mailto:interact@soundopinions.org) or message board:

- {artist: Santo and Johnny}, "{track: Sleepwalk}"
- {artist: The Buzzcocks}, "{track: Everybody's Happy Nowadays}"
- {artist: Curtis Mayfield}, "{track: Freddie's Dead}"
- {artist: Jeff Buckley}, "{track: Corpus Christi Texas}"
- {artist: R.E.M.}, "{track: Try Not to Breathe}"
- {artist: Jeff Buckley}, "{track: Satisfied Mind}"
- {artist: Tom Waits}, "{track: Come On Up To The House}"
- {artist: Peter Gabriel}, "{track: I Grieve}"
- {artist: Joy Division}, "{track: In a Lonely Place}"
- {artist: The Beach Boys}, "{track: God Only Knows}"
- {artist: Alice Cooper}, "{track: I Love the Dead}"
- {artist: Talking Heads}, "{track: This Must Be the Place (Na√Øve Melody)}"
- {artist: Billy Bragg} and {artist: Wilco}, "{track: Remember the Mountain Bed}"

#### Greg
Jim and Greg were forced to think about their final day as well. Greg goes first (since Jim predicts he actually will). He decides he wants [Sound Opinions guest](/show/1/) {artist: John Cale}'s [cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzu4LE667VM) of "{track: Hallelujah}" to be played at his funeral. He calls it the 20th century version of "{track: Amazing Grace}". Although Cale's version strays from {artist: Leonard Cohen}'s original, Greg thinks the message remains intact: "I made a lot of mistakes, but it was all worthwhile."

#### Jim
Jim predicts that even at his funeral he won't be able to resist one last chance to be sarcastic. He chooses an irreverent version of {artist: Frank Sinatra}'s classic "{track: My Way}." Jim shares {place: Hoboken} roots with "Ol' Blue Eyes," but he feels he shares a lot more with {artist: Sex Pistols} member {name: Sid Vicious}. So all of you Sound Opinions listeners who plan to come out to mourn on that fateful day will get to enjoy [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDyb_alTkMQ&feature=kp) {genre: punk} cover.

## 00:13:08 List: Goth Rock for Halloween
Next up Jim and Greg move into the dark, "labyrinthian" underground of {genre: Goth Rock}. What better way to celebrate Halloween than with a {tag: Goth} soundtrack? Before they discuss the current scene with their special Goth guest, Scary Lady Sarah, Jim and Greg want to highlight songs from a recent {label: Rhino} box set celebrating the genre. Included in this montage are:

- {artist: The Cure}, "{track: Charlotte Sometimes}"
- {artist: Einsturzende Neubauten}, "{track: Morning Dew}"
- {artist: The Cult}, "{track: Rain}"
- {artist: Alien Sex Fiend}, "{track: Now I'm Feeling Zombified}"
- {artist: The Sisters of Mercy}, "{track: Temple of Love}"
- {artist: Killing Joke}, "{track: Tomorrow's World}"
- {artist: Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds}, "{track: The Weeping Song}"


## 00:21:46 Interview: Scary Lady Sarah
![Bauhaus](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2006/bauhaus.jpg)
For {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}, the ultimate {genre: Goth} progenitors are the band {artist: Bauhaus}. Named for the German art movement, the group made {genre: minimalist}, {genre: electronic} music that focused on dark subjects. Initially, they shied away from the term "Goth," but with song titles like that of their debut single, "{track: Bela Lugosi's Dead}," you can understand why it stuck. Greg saw the group at the {tag: Coachella} Music Festival in 2005, and vocalist {name: Peter Murphy} performed the entire song suspended upside down over the stage like a bat. So, it seems they've warmed up to the Goth moniker.

In order to go deeper into the Goth underground, Jim and Greg invite {name: Scary Lady Sarah} to join the show. Our guest has been a mainstay on the goth scene for almost 20 years. She is a {tag: DJ} and promoter based in {place: Chicago} and {name: Berlin}, and runs {tag: American Goth Productions}. 

Scary Lady Sarah's goth rock picks:

- {artist: Thatch Noir}, "{track: Cat in a Box}"
- {artist: Miguel and the Living Dead}, "{track: Graveyard Love Song}"
- {artist: Faith & The Muse}, "{track: Sredni Vashtar}" 
- {artist: Pretentious, Moi?}, "{track: The Haunting}"

Her other current faves include:

- {artist: Blacklist}
- {artist: Diary of Dreams} 
- {artist: Entertainment} 
- {artist: Ether Aura} 
- {artist: Frank the Baptist} 
- {artist: Mephisto Walz} 
- {artist: Passion Play}
- {artist: Solemn Novena}

## 00:41:11 List: Halloween Picks 2006
During the final segment of the show, our {tag: Halloween}-loving hosts play their picks for scariest rock songs. 
#### Greg
Greg's first choice is "{track: Dead Souls}" by {artist: Joy Division}. This band didn't necessarily look scary, but they definitely have a dark history. Lead singer {name: Ian Curtis} suffered from epilepsy and would often have seizures onstage. He committed {tag: suicide} in {era: 1980}, cementing the band's tortured image.

Greg's second song is {artist: Johnny Cash}'s cover of "{track: The Mercy Seat}" by {artist: Nick Cave}. Cave is often associated with the Goth movement, but Cash is not someone you usually think of on a spooky Halloween night. This song fits perfectly into Cash's repertoire. It tells the story of a death row inmate on the last night of his life. {name: Benmont Tensch}'s backing music in particular lends a haunting feel.

#### Jim
Jim wanted to illustrate Goth's influence on other genres with his first pick. The group {artist: Bloodrock} is composed of your average {genre: hard-rock} "buffoons," according to Jim, but Jim can't think of anything more gothic than the subject of their song "{track: D.O.A.}" It tells the tale of a car crash victim on his way to the other side (and it sounds like the bad side).

Jim's final track is by {name: Susan Janet Dallion}, otherwise known as {artist: Siouxsie Sioux}. Siouxsie emerged out of the {place: Bromley} {genre: punk} scene to join {artist: the Banshees} and form her own distinctive sound. Her look and her sound solidified the singer as female Goth icon. {artist: The Beatles}' song "{track: Dear Prudence}" isn't particularly scary, but Siouxie's menacing vocals give it an ominous tone. In this rendition, Jim imagines that Prudence's fate is not unlike that of most horror film heroines.
