# Show 582: The Album Leaf & Opinions on The xx and The Flaming Lips

![The Album Leaf](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2017/albumleaf_web.jpg)

{artist : The Album Leaf} combines digital and organic instruments to make a unique sound. Bandleader {name : Jimmy LaValle} joins {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} to talk about the importance of giving {genre : electronic} music a live experience and how the Album Leaf grew from a side project into a full time gig. Plus, reviews of the new albums from {artist : The Flaming Lips} and {artist : The xx}.



## 00:01:45 Review: The xx

![I See You](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/582/2X0.jpg)

When {artist : The xx} were [guests on the shows in 2010](/show/233/), {host : Jim} & {host : Greg} had no idea the {place : British} trio's blend of modern {genre : soul} with {genre : minimalist} '80s {genre : alternative} sounds would prove so influential. Greg says that the band has subtly expanded its sound on its third album {album : I See You}, but hasnn't taken any big musical leaps. Because he feels the group hasn't quite got there yet, Greg gives the album a {tag : Try It}. Jim, however, loves the contrast between the album's celebratory sounds and its hints of darkness under the surface. Jim says The xx have grown and are pointing toward something exciting, proving they're a career band. For him, {album : I See You} is a {tag : Buy It}.



## 00:09:08 Review: The Flaming Lips

![Oczy Mlody](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/582/F80.jpg)

The fourteenth studio album by [{artist : The Flaming Lips}](/show/94/) is titled {album : Oczy Mlody}, a Polish phrase meaning "the eyes of the young." {host : Jim} says its a sleepy album, filled with electronic glitchiness and {name : Miley Cyrus} cameos, but lacking the tunefulness that once made them a great band. According to Jim, the Lips have spent the last decade churning out product without really spending time crafting their records in the studio. {host : Greg} agrees that the songwriting has fallen off on {album : Oczy Mlody}. They both give the album a {tag : Try It} rating, saying it's nowhere in league with the band's best. Jim, as the [author of The Flaming Lips' biography](http://www.jimdero.com/LipsOpen.htm), recommends that listeners who have only heard the last decade of Flaming Lips music check out their back catalog, pointing to early masterpieces like 1990's {album : In a Priest Driven Ambulance} and {album : Transmissions from the Satellite Heart} from 1993.

## 00:21:30 Interview: The Album Leaf

"Soundtracks for movies that live in his head" is how {host : Jim} describes the music made by {name : Jimmy LaValle} of {artist : the Album Leaf}. LaValle's music is often grand and sweeping, while still being intimate. It is a sound that comes from the creative melding of {genre : electronica} with organic instruments like the {tag : violin} and {tag : trumpet}. Check out our [video](https://www.facebook.com/soundopinions/videos/10154034257491431/) to see how it comes together in a live setting. The Album Leaf started as a solo project of LaValle's more than 15 years ago but over time it has become a full fledged touring band. The Album Leaf joined us live in our studios to talk about its latest album, {album : Between Waves}.



## 00:51:14 DIJ: Jim

This week, it's {host : Jim}'s turn to bring a track he can't live without to play in the {tag : desert island jukebox}. He selects the song "{track : Can't Stand the Midwest}" by {artist : Dow Jones & The Industrials}. The {place : Indiana} band came up in the emerging {genre : punk} scene in the late {era : '70s} and early {era : '80s}, however Jim didn't discover them until fairly recently when their music was reissued. While the band never found huge fame, their fast and dynamic songs could sustain Jim on a desert island for quite a while. He chose "Can't Stand the Midwest" to highlight, because although Jim has called the Midwest home for a number of years now, it can sometimes make even him a little stir crazy.
