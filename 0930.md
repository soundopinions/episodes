## 00:00:57 Review: Mitski

![Mitski The Land Is Inhospitable and So Are We](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/930/1L1.jpg)

{artist : Mitski} has considered quitting the music industry in recent years, but her follow-up to last year's “Laurel Hell” is already here. “{album : The Land Is Inhospitable And So Are We}” is an ambitious piece of art rock that borders on an unpretentious opera.



## 00:08:15 Review: Low Cut Connie

![Low Cut Connie ART DEALERS](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/930/DR6.jpg)

{artist : Low Cut Connie} is essentially the project of one man- Adam Weiner. And while the band's focus on picking up where the great rock pianists left off is unchanged on the new album, “{album : Art Dealers},” the artistry and lyricism have leveled up in keeping with the high standard set by 2020's “Private Lives” album.



## 00:15:34 Review: Jaimie Branch

![Jaimie Branch Fly or Die Fly or Die Fly or Die (world war))](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/930/PY1.jpg)

{artist : Jaimie Branch} was one of the most exciting jazz musicians going when she died earlier this year at age 39. This album, “{album : Fly or Die Fly or Die Fly or Die ((world war))}” was nearly complete when she died, and it is possibly some of her best work.



## 00:23:01 Interview: Brian Koppelman
