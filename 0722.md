![fugazi](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2019/fugazi.jpg)

{place : Washington D.C.}Â  {genre : post-punk} band {artist : Fugazi} reshaped the definition of {genre : punk} in America. Their 1990 debut album, {album : Repeater}, connected with a generation and eventually sold more than a million copies. Jim and Greg talk with founding member {artist : Ian MacKaye} about the writing and recording of the album and its impact. Plus we review {artist : Sturgill Simpson}'s new album, {album : Sound and Fury}, and learn what song got a member of the band {artist : Dehd} "{tag : Hooked on Sonics}."

{artist : Fugazi} was a post-punk band from {place : Washington D.C.} that maintained a fiercely independent, DIY ethic and still went on to sell millions of records. Though their best known song is probably "{track : Waiting Room}" from their 1988 self-titled EP, their first full length album, {album : Repeater}, deserves to be considered a classic album according to {host : Jim} and {host : Greg}.

Initially an open-ended outlet for former {artist : Minor Threat} frontman {name : Ian MacKaye}'s musical creativity, Fugazi grew into something more when all four members found ways to contribute their ideas. MacKaye told Jim and Greg that Repeater was their first release after former {artist : Rites of Spring} singer {name : Guy Picciotto} started playing guitar in the group in addition to singing. Greg pointed out that Picciotto and MacKaye approached their guitars more like sound machines than traditional instruments, letting the rhythm section of drummer {name : Brendan Canty} and bassist {name : Joe Lally} drive the songs.

The conversation covers the lyrical differences between Fugazi and Minor Threat, the importance of Fugazi's live shows and explains why a tank of helium was necessary for one of Fugazi's biggest shows in {place : Chicago}.

## 00:39:00 Review: Sturgill Simpson

![sturgill](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/722/1T00.jpg)

{artist : Sturgill Simpson} just released his latest album {album : Sound & Fury}, on which he continues to blend {genre : country} with {genre : psychedelic} influences and push the boundaries of music. Both {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} are enthusiastic about Simpson's fourth album, and can't get enough of the dramatic sonic elements like cranking the guitar way up and the {artist : Can}-like instrumentals. The lyrics are also important, as Simpson shares his experience of clashing with the country music industry and more universal themes like the environment and today's political climate. Greg thinks that it would wrong if critics left this album off their "best of year" lists at the end of 2019.
