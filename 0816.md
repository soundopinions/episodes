# Show 816: Dawn Richard, Opinions on Sault & Lucy Dacus

Dawn Richard is a thriving indie artist making exciting and genre blending music on her own terms. But nothing could have prepared her for the chaos that would come from beginning her career as a member of the Diddy-constructed pop group, Danity Kane. Hosts Jim DeRogatis and Greg Kot talk with Dawn about her fantastic new album Second Line and about her unconventional musical trajectory. They’ll also review some new music.  Take our Survey: https://bit.ly/3i4BWdinsn Join our Facebook Group: https://bit.ly/3sivr9TBecome a member on Patreon: https://bit.ly/3slWZvcSign up for our newsletter: https://bit.ly/3eEvRnGMake a donation via PayPal: https://bit.ly/3dmt9lURecord a Voice Memo: https://bit.ly/2RyD5Ah Featured Songs:
