# Show 608: Fantasy Songs, Slowdive & Opinions on Public Enemy

![Fantasy Songs](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2017/fantasysongs_web.png)

The {genre: fantasy} powerhouse *Game of Thrones* is returning for its penultimate season. With dragons, knights, and magic on their minds, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} play their favorite songs about fantasy worlds. Plus, a review of the latest from {genre: hip-hop} stalwarts {artist: Public Enemy}, and {name: Neil Halstead} of {artist: Slowdive} shares the song that got him {tag: Hooked on Sonics}.

## 00:01:45 News: 07.21.2017
Earlier this week, {host: Jim} published an in-depth piece on [{tag: BuzzFeed}](https://www.buzzfeed.com/jimderogatis/parents-told-police-r-kelly-is-keeping-women-in-a-cult?utm_term=.mdBWpOy7w#.eeD1pqY8d) about new allegations against {genre: R&B} star {artist: R. Kelly} that he is keeping women in controlling relationship and requiring them to sever communications with their families. The article details the allegations of two families who say their daughters have been "brainwashed" by Kelly and that he is controlling when they can eat, what clothes they can wear and who they can communicate with. Kelly, and at least one of the women in the piece, denies these allegations. Jim has reported on similar [claims](http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/sun-times-archive-r-kelly-accused-of-sex-with-teenage-girls/) about Kelly going back to the year 2000. 

## 00:06:29 Review: Public Enemy
![Nothing is Quick in The Desert](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2017/public%20enemy.jpg)
Earlier this month, {genre: Hip-hop} stalwarts {artist: Public Enemy} released their 14th album, {album: Nothing is Quick in the Desert}. The release was available as a free download for only a limited time; but can still be listened to on YouTube.
Greg notes that the group has been around for thirty years, providing important, socially conscious rhymes on albums like 1988's {album: It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back}. This album attempts to continue that tradition.
Jim can do without {name: Flavor Flav}, but Greg disagrees saying that the emcee adds "comic relief" and "flavor" to what can be an otherwise "heavy" group. However, Jim adds that {name: Chuck D} provides insightful, politically charged lyrics.
{host: Jim} says that though half of the album is "as good as anything Public Enemy has given us", he can only give the record a {tag: Try It}.
If you are looking for the old Public Enemy, according to {host: Greg} your best bet is to seek out "old Public Enemy" music. But, the group is still an arena-rap draw, he says; and the material on the album will play better on the stage. In that context, Greg gives the album a {tag: Try It}, as well.


## 00:16:46 List: Fantasy Songs
Whether Mordor, Westeros, or a dystopian landscape, multiple artists have written songs that pay homage to their favorite {tag: fantasy worlds.}  This week, Jim and Greg share their inner nerdiness and pick their favorite {genre: prog rock} and {genre: fantasy}-inspired songs. 

### Greg
- {artist: Deltron 3030} - {track: "3030" }
- {artist: Procol Harum} - {track: "A Whiter Shade of Pale" }

## 00:28:10 Interview: David Weigel
![prog rock](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2017/prog%20rock.jpg) Perhaps more than any other genre, {genre: Progressive Rock} has a particular penchant for fantasy motifs. From {artist: Gensis}, to {artist: Yes}, to {artist: Rush}, to {artist: King Crimson} dystopian worlds, hobbits, and medieval imagery found a home within those sprawling 14-minute long songs. But why? Jim and Greg speak {name: David Weigel}, national correspondent for the {tag: Washington Post}, and author *The Show That Never Ends: The Rise And Fall Of Prog Rock*. Weigel says that in the early {era: 1970}s as prog was making its rise, the works of {name: J.R.R. Tolkien} were not the blockbuster films we know today. Instead, they were much more a part of the counter-culture, like prog rock. 
### David's 4 Favorite Prog Fantasy Records
- {artist: King Crimson} - {album: In The Court Of The Crimson King}
- {artist: Bo Hansson} - {album: Music Inspired By Lord Of The Rings}
- {artist: Genesis} - {album: The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway}
- {artist: Magma} - {album: Magma (AKA Kobaia)}

Our latest installment of our {tag: Hooked on Sonics} series features {name: Neil Halstead} – singer, songwriter, and guitarist of the English {genre: shoegaze} band {artist: Slowdive}. Slowdive recently reunited and released their first album since 1995. Halstead describes being blown away when he heard the leadoff track from an EP by a shoegaze progenitor: {artist: My Bloody Valentine}'s "{track: You Made Me Realise}." Combining {artist: [The] Byrds}-like harmonies with a sonic assault, the song forever changed his musical life.
