# Show 398: Music of The Beats & Opinions on Jay-Z 
{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} talk about the intersection of rock and {tag: Beat poetry} with {genre: Beat} scholar {name: Simon Warner}.

![beatgeneration](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2013/beatgeneration.jpg)

## 00:01:46 Intro: Music News
{host: Greg} spoke to {artist: Lauryn Hill} in 1999, a year after the release of her {tag: Grammy}-winning solo album {artist: The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill}. If you had told him then that 14 years later she'd be in prison, he would've gasped. But the former {artist: Fugees} singer began serving a three-month prison sentence on Monday for failing to pay about $1 million in taxes over the past decade. Here a {place: Danbury} inmate offers her some advice.

## 00:04:24 Feature: Music of the Beat Generation
If you read {tag: *On the Road*} in high school, you know a thing or two about the {genre: Beat} movement's influence on literature. This week, {tag: *Text and Drugs and Rock 'n' Roll*} author {name: Simon Warner} wants to get you thinking about the {genre: Beat} influence on rock. Forget the stereotypical bongos; Warner says Beat fathers like {name: Allen Ginsberg} and {name: Jack Kerouac} were most inspired by {place: Harlem}'s avant-garde {genre: jazz} invention, {genre: Bebop}. Warner makes the case that the Beats influenced a whole generation of rock lyricists - {name: Bob Dylan} and {name: John Lennon} among them - to embrace a more surrealist, personal, and politically engaged approach to lyric-writing. Think of "{track: Subterranean Homesick Blues}," he says, as Beat poetry with a, well, beat. But while Ginsberg and Kerouac struck a chord with the hippie generation, it was Beat colleague {name: William S. Burroughs} who served as guru to the later musical avant-garde. {era: 1970's} {genre: punk}s {name: Jim Carroll} and {artist: Patti Smith}, and alternative era stars like {name: Kurt Cobain} and {artist: Sonic Youth}, all made pilgrimages to Burroughs' {place: NYC} bunker-apartment to pay their respects to "Old Bull Lee." Burroughs' "cut up" writing technique may still inspire wordsmiths from {artist: [David] Bowie} to {name: Thom Yorke}, but Jim thinks it's Kerouac whose legacy may ultimately be the most lasting. It's that writer's spirit of adventure, {host: Jim} says, that continues to motivate every indie band still "on the road."

## 00:42:54 Review: Jay-Z
![Magna Carta... Holy Grail](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/398/1ZI0.jpg)

{artist: Jay-Z} was the first to point out that he's not just a businessman, but a "business, man." He's sold 50 million records in the past two decades and is valued at almost half a billion dollars. And with this latest album, {album: Magna Carta Holy Grail}, he sold a million albums to {tag: Samsung} before the actual release date. So you cannot argue with Jay's success. But, what about the music? {host: Jim} hears a lot of complaining and a lot of bragging. The only reason for his {tag: Burn It} rating is the terrific sounding {tag: production} from people like {name: Timbaland} and {name: Swizz Beats}. {host: Greg} thinks Hova is just coasting on this record. There's no emotional depth and no reason you shouldn't {tag: Trash It}.

## 00:50:18 DIJ: Jim
Jim's been thinking about ["Summer Songs"](http://www.soundopinions.org/show/132) this season and remembers being 7-years old on the {place: New Jersey} boardwalk and hearing "{track: Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey}," by {artist: Paul and Linda McCartney}. The {album: Ram} track is "cheesy," to be sure, but man did McCartney have a way with hooks. Jim has no idea what the lyrics mean-are they about drugs? {tag: WWII}?-but the song deserves a place in the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}.
