{artist: Prince} has always been on the cutting edge when it comes to distribution, but now he is joining the ranks of musicians who have made deals with big box merchandisers. His new three-disc collection will be sold exclusively at {tag: Target} later this month for just $11.98. Previously he tried to deliver an album through {tag: The Daily Mail} and also bundled wtih concert tickets. {artist: No Doubt} is following suit. They are offering the band's entire catalog for free along with the purchase of a concert ticket. Seems like a pretty good deal for consumers, but may not be as good of a deal to independent retailers.

## 00:07:19 Classic Album Dissection: Astral Weeks
![Astral Weeks (Expanded Edition)](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music60/v4/bb/f8/24/bbf82414-ffe7-35ad-6d6a-d124eb2f63a5/source/600x600bb.jpg "253638/1041585854")
{artist: Van Morrison} recorded and released his masterpiece {album: Astral Weeks} 41 years ago, and to celebrate he released a live version of the album. This gave {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} a perfect opportunity to look back at {album: Astral Weeks} with a Sound Opinions Classic Dissection. {album: Astral Weeks} didn't produce huge hits, but as Jim and Greg explain, this record is unique from any other in Van Morrison's collection, and in fact, rock history. It melds {genre: rock}, {genre: blues}, {genre: folk} and {genre: jazz} in such a way that makes it hard to define. The jazz musicians who contributed to this sound were guitarist {name: Jay Berliner}, drummer {name: Connie Kay} and bassist {name: Richard Davis}. In addition to the music, Jim and Greg both marvel at the emotions conveyed by the songs on {album: Astral Weeks}. You hear Van Morrison struggle with the search for home and the impermanence of life. It's as much a poem as it is an album, making it a classic in the Sound Opinions' book.

## 00:38:26 Review: Kelly Clarkson
![All I Ever Wanted](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/72/ad/b1/72adb10c-7be2-1b2e-43d3-c12408fe5cc6/source/600x600bb.jpg "316265/305149890")
America's first "Idol" {artist: Kelly Clarkson} has a new album out called {album: All I Ever Wanted}. Clarkson's last release was a stinker even by label head {name: Clive Davis}' standards, so this was her chance at redemption. Did she succeed? Jim likes a lot of feminist {genre: pop punk}, but he's mystified by Kelly Clarkson's appeal. That said, half of this album is undeniably catchy pop rock. He has no use for the other half, however, which is full of soggy ballads. {host: Jim} gives the album a {tag: Try It}. Greg can see why fans are taken with the singer. She has an endearing personality and a great voice. But her conservative production choices overshadow any good ideas Clarkson might be trying to get across. {album: All I Ever Wanted} is far from what {host: Greg} wants; he gives it a {tag: Trash It} rating.

## 00:45:03 Review: K'Naan
![Troubadour](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/8c/54/32/8c543209-90c7-fa40-968f-8c3b40a5284e/source/600x600bb.jpg "81983314/380535315")
Next up {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} review the second album from rapper {artist: K'Naan}. In his songs K'Naan describes the tough streets he grew up on. And we believe him. Before settling in {place: Ontario}, K'Naan lived in {place: Mogadishu}. You can hear his African roots in the music, along with {genre: reggae} and {genre: hip hop} beats. Greg finds this hybrid really fresh. But, the record falls down when he tries to be too diverse. Greg gives {album: Troubadour} a {tag: Try It}. Jim wonders if he's just in a better mood today. He agrees that some of the diverse cameos like {name: Adam Levine} and {name: Kirk Hammett} are totally unnecessary. But K'Naan has a strong voice and his songs have a strong sense of melody. The record gets a {tag: Buy It} rating from Jim.

## 00:50:59 DIJ: Greg
Recently Greg's been thinking about whatever happened to {genre: soul} singer {artist: D'Angelo}. He made what {host: Greg} would consider a masterful album in {era: 2000}. {album: Voodoo} put D'Angelo at the heart of the {genre: neo-soul} movement, but that's the last we've heard from him. Greg can't explain the disappearance, but he can relive the singer's glory days with this week's {tag: Desert Island Jukebox} song "{track: Devil's Pie}."
