# Show 1049: British Post-Punk Pioneers the Raincoats

![Raincoats](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2026/raincoats.jpg)

Hosts Jim DeRogatis and Greg Kot explore the music and legacy of the Raincoats, a post-punk band beloved by musicians and critics alike. Raincoats leaders Gina Burch and Ana da Silva join Jim and Greg to reflect on creating their debut album in 1979 and staying creative in the decades since. Though they never found mainstream success, the Raincoats' sound left a deep mark on alternative music—including on one of their most famous fans, Kurt Cobain of Nirvana.
