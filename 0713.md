## 00:01:30 Interview: Julia Jacklin

She released her second album earlier in 2019 called {album : Crushing}, which Jim and Greg both greatly enjoyed. Her musical style is a blend of {genre : pop}, {genre : folk} and {genre : rock}, packed full of beautiful and honest lyrics. Some of the themes she explores in her music are social perception, anxiety, boundaries, insecurity and reclaiming your own power. {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} talk to her at the {place : Goose Island Tap Room} about her record and musical career, and she also gives a live performance.



## 00:41:15 Review: Blood Orange

![blood orange](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/713/1WR0.jpg)

{artist : Dev Haynes} has been recording as {artist : Blood Orange} since 2008, and has released a number of critically acclaimed projects, including {album : Freetown Sound} and {album : Negro Swan}. {album : Angel's Pulse} is the latest release from soulful British singer, songwriter and producer. Comprised mainly of tracks produced all over the world featuring a variety of guests (from {artist : Project Pat} to {artist : Kelsey Lu}), Jim thinks that, upon first listen, {album : Angel's Pulse} "seems a little scattered"... as if "your Spotify skipped ahead to another artist."  According to {host : Jim}, "to Blood Orange, genre doesn't exist." But in every track, despite the sound, Jim notes that "soul is a common denominator." {host : Greg} agrees that Angel's Pulse has an all over the map approach, consisting of songs like {track : Tuesday Feeling} that reminds him of {artist : Stevie Wonder} or {track : Gold Teeth} that beckons to {genre : lo-fi}  {genre : Southern Hip Hop}. Greg adds that he's just glad to get more music from the artist.



## 00:47:44 DIJ: Jim

In honor of the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11 landing on the moon, {host : Jim} honors his space-obsessed five year old self by playing {artist : Pink Floyd}'s "{track : Moonhead}." He recalls watching the landing on television as a child, but admits only hearing this song recently- despite decades of Pink Floyd fandom. The improvised track was never included on a Pink Floyd album- it was performed live on the {tag : BBC} during the {tag : Apollo 11} mission. As Jim points out, "The Floyd" were far from superstars at this point. {album : Dark Side of The Moon} was still years off in the future. But in {place : the UK} they did enjoy cult renown as an interesting outfit obsessed with space thanks to songs like "{track : Astronomy Domine}," "{track : Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun}" and "{track : Interstellar Overdrive}."

Ultimately, there's good reason "Moonhead" didn't become better known- the 12-minute instrumental was upstaged by {artist : David Bowie}'s "{track : Space Oddity}," which premiered on the same BBC program.
