# Show 232: Buried Treasures & Opinions on The New Pornographers
{tag: Buried Treasures}: With more than 100,000 records released every year, it's easy for some gems to fall through the track. This week {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} unearth some of their favorites.

## 00:01:52 News: 5.7.2010
Only five months ago {tag: Apple} purchased the online music site {tag: Lala.com}, and now they've announced it's shutting down. While it was never clear that a streaming music model would fit into Apple's {tag: iTunes} download model, they did spend more than $80 million, so it is a bit of a head-scratcher. As {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} explain, this move has prompted speculation that Apple will soon be launching its own streaming music site, and just wanted to get rid of its competition. Regardless, it's clear that soon we'll all have our head in the "clouds." 

{name: Roger Waters}, the {tag: bassist}, {tag: lyricist} and some might say "brains" of {artist: Pink Floyd}, recently announced an upcoming {tag: tour} marking the {tag: 30th anniversary} of {album: The Wall}. He's now saying that fellow Floyd alum {name: David Gilmour} won't be along for the ride because he's "completely uninterested." It's clear now that we shouldn't be holding our breath for a Pink Floyd reunion, and according to Jim, maybe we shouldn't want one. {name: Syd Barrett} and {name: Rick Wright} are both deceased, and there can be no Pink Floyd without them.

Just when you thought there would never be another blockbuster music group in the digital age, {artist: The Black Eyed Peas} have come along with more proof to the contrary. Their song "{track: I Gotta Feeling}" just became the biggest selling digital track in history with more than 5.5 million downloads. Their 2009 track "{track: Boom Boom Pow}," is also in the top 5. As {tag: Rolling Stone} asserts, this is the band of the moment, and they are doing it 21st century style-with lots of {tag: viral marketing}, {tag: digital music sales} and {tag: corporate sponsorships}. Another 21st century force to be reckoned with is {artist: Lady Gaga}. Her own {tag: video} for "{track: Telephone}," has become a sensation, all while spawning a number of video viral copycats. The latest comes out of the 82nd airborne division in Afghanistan. Their version of "Telephone" has been viewed over 2 million times, and for Greg, it trumps the original.

## 00:49:08 Review: The New Pornographers
![Together](//static.soundopinions.org/assets/232/29W0.jpg "4978498/364679767")
{artist: The New Pornographers} have a new album called {album: Together}. But {host: Jim} wonders if the title is ironic. The band includes {name: A.C. Newman}, {name: Neko Case} and {name: Dan Bejar} -- all successful solo artists in their own right. And he doesn't get the sense that they really came together for The New Pornographers record. He doesn't hear energy or inspiration, and gives the supergroup a super {tag: Trash It} rating. {host: Greg}, on the contrary, didn't hear anyting patchwork about *Together*. That's the band's great trick. What does hold them back is Newman's oblique lyrics, which make it difficult to make an emotional connection to the songs. That said, the music is beautiful, exuberant and a {tag: Buy It}.
