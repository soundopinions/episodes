## 00:00:51 Review: Iris DeMent

![Iris DeMent Workin on a World](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/904/1F1.jpg)

{artist : Iris DeMent} has been fairly synonymous with American folk music since she made her debut in the early 1990s. Her album of duets with John Prine is beloved, but her latest album, {album : Workin' On A World} has Jim and Greg split.



## 00:10:33 Review: Screaming Females

![Screaming Females Desire Pathway](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/904/HL1.jpg)

{artist : Screaming Females} first drew critical acclaim for their guitar power trio heroics under the leadership of a teenaged Marissa Paternoster. On their eighth album, {album : Desire Pathway}, the band's essence is unchanged, though their technical craftsmanship has grown.



## 00:17:01 Interview: Rose Marshack & Rick Valentin

![rose m](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2023/rose-m.jpeg)

{artist : Poster Children} formed in 1987 at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and its two core members {tag : Rose Marshack} and {tag : Rick Valentin} are still on a college campus- now as professors at Illinois State University. Even after signing to a major label in the alternative music boom, Poster Children have never called it quits and now Marshack's memoir “{tag : Play Like A Man}” tells the band's story.
