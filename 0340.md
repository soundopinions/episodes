## 00:01:48 News: 6.1.2012
Jim and Greg kick off the show by announcing the winner of the annual {tag: Eurovision Song Contest}, which Jim describes as {tag: American Idol} on steroids. Over 125 million people watched {place: Sweden}'s {name: Loreen} take the prize in {place: Baku, Azerbaijan} for her track "{track: Euphoria}." But it was the {artist: Russian Grannies} from {place: Buranovo} who won people's hearts with their unique party song.

{tag: American Idol} continues to dominate the pop world, all while it slips a little bit in the television one. Season 8 runner-up {artist: Adam Lambert} has the {tag: #1 album} this week beating out fellow Idol alum {artist: Carrie Underwood}. But, this comes after the show aired its lowest rated finale to date. Greg wonders if viewers were underwhelmed by the crowning of another "white guy with a guitar." Or, are there just too many music contests like {tag: The Voice} and {tag: Duets} crowding the airwaves? Does this over-saturation mean that Idol will never produce another Lambert, Underwood, Clarkson or Daughtry? Perhaps. And maybe you say, "Good riddance."

Also in the news, {artist: Amanda Palmer} just reached a huge milestone in the era of the fan-funded album. Using {tag: Kickstarter}, the {artist: Dresden Dolls} singer raised over $1 million for her new album - ten times what she wanted. In return for these donations, Palmer will have to do everything from provide digital downloads to participate in an art sitting. And of course, she'll have to pony up to Uncle Sam as well.

## 00:09:54 Special: Alan Lomax Archive
With the recent passings of both {artist: Earl Scruggs} and {artist: Doc Watson}, Jim and Greg have been thinking about the importance of preserving the recorded legacy of {place: America}'s {genre: roots music} giants. No one has done it better than the {tag: Alan Lomax Archive}. From the 1930's through the 1980's, Lomax travelled the country making field recordings of American folk musicians. And now all that tape has been transformed into ones and zeroes. {name: Don Fleming}, {tag: Executive Director} of {tag: The Association for Cultural Equity}, talks to Jim and Greg about making over 17,000 Lomax recordings available to stream online as part of the {tag: Global Jukebox} project. Don hopes the expanded access will encourage more artists to sample and draw inspiration from Lomax recordings, not just heavy-hitters like {artist: Moby} and {artist: The Boss}.

## 00:21:18 Interview: Screaming Females
If ever a band was perfectly named, it's the {artist: Screaming Females}. Ok, true, there's only one screaming female in the {place: New Jersey} {genre: punk} trio, but {name: Marissa Paternoster} has quite the set of pipes. And, as Jim and Greg point out, she can shred too. She credits people like {name: Johnny Greenwood} of {artist: Radiohead} and {name: Billy Corgan} of the {artist: Smashing Pumpkins} for influencing her guitar style. But when it comes to the band's ethos, that's pure DIY punk. {tag: Drummer} {name: Jarrett Dougherty} explains that self-releasing albums was difficult at first, but they approached it with professional aims, unlike many of their {place: New Brunswick }peers who were satisfied with nothing more than releasing internet demos. Now the Screaming Females are on their 5th release called {album: Ugly}. Check out their performance live on Sound Opinions.
