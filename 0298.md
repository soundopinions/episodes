## 00:01:53 News: 8.12.2011
The {place: London} {tag: riots} have hit the music industry hard. A {place: North London} warehouse owned by {tag: Sony DADC} burned to the ground on Monday, and while Sony may have deep pockets, many of the smaller {tag: independent labels} that stored stock at the facility do not. The {tag: fire} destroyed CDs, DVDs and LPs distributed by the {tag: Pias Group}. Pias serves over 160 indie labels including {label: Domino}, {label: 4AD}, {label: Warp}, {label: Sub Pop} and {place: Chicago}'s own {label: Thrill Jockey}, which estimated a loss of $300,000 worth of inventory. For small labels dependent on merch sales to survive, it could be a fatal blow. A {tag: relief} effort is underway at {tag: Label Love}. Whether music fans' goodwill will be enough to keep these labels afloat remains to be seen.

Big changes are underway at everyone's favorite industry lobbying group. {tag: RIAA} {tag: CEO} {name: Mitch Bainwol} has announced he will cede the throne after a decade of leadership to become head of the {tag: Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers}. He'll be replaced by {name: Cary Sherman}. Word of the change came in the form of a dumbfounding open letter, in which Bainwol proclaims a "turnaround" in the music industry's fortunes and cites some interesting statistics. He claims a 20% reduction in illegal filesharing last year and a 5-to-1 ratio of legal to illegal music consumption - numbers that {host: Greg} says fly in the face of all the stats he's seen on this. Bainwol also cites a 4% increase in revenue last month - no mention, of course, of the music industry's bottoming-out over the last decade.

## 00:08:12 Interview: Damon and Naomi
After the breakup of their first band - the hugely influential indie group {artist: Galaxie 500} - {tag: husband and wife} team {artist: Damon and Naomi} considered an early retirement from music. But then they began writing songs together. Twenty years later, they're one of rocks longest-running duos. This week {name: Damon Krukowski} and {name: Naomi Yang} drop by the studio to perform music from their new album, {album: False Beats and True Hearts}, and share some tips for keeping a band and a relationship going strong over the decades. The key, says Damon, is change.

The couple met when they were just teenagers - students at the same {place: Manhattan} prep school. It wasn't until college that they and {place: Harvard} classmate {name: Dean Wareham} began making music together. (They also went to school with another hot touring act from the past year) With Damon on drums, Naomi on bass, and Wareham on guitar and lead vocals, Galaxie 500 helped to define the dreamy {tag: lo-fi} sound many call {genre: slowcore}. The band broke up in 1991 after releasing only three studio albums, but unlike so many of their peers, Damon and Naomi aren't interested in a reunion tour. They say they prefer to keep moving forward. They have eight studio albums to their name and can boast collaborations with musicians like {artist: Bhob Rainey}, {artist: Smokey Hormel} and the {place: Japanese} band {artist: Ghost}. As {host: Jim} observes, that love of collaboration is just part of their rhythm section mentality.

## 00:42:24 Review: Jay-Z and Kanye West
![Watch the Throne](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ee/Watch_The_Throne.jpg "112080/455392802")
And speaking of collaborations, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} review this year's most anticipated one: {artist: Jay-Z} and {artist: Kanye West}'s {album: Watch the Throne}. Do these guys even need an introduction? If Jay-Z's highly lucrative past collaborations with {artist: R. Kelly }are any indication, Jim bets the Throne album and tour will hurt neither artist's bottom line. But what about the music? While Greg admits nothing could have lived up to the hype, he's disappointed by how Jay-Z and Kanye have misread the tenor of the times. In a summer of high unemployment, economic turmoil, and foreign revolutions, they're still rapping about their wealth. Kanye's recent albums may be among the best of the past decade, and Jay-Z might be the greatest MC living, but Greg and Jim agree - this is a {tag: Trash It} record.

## 00:49:41 Review: Jimmie Vaughn
![Plays More Blues, Ballads & Favorites (feat. Lou Ann Barton)](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/f3/26/4a/f3264ad3-dbcf-8de1-1dda-576c83de1d67/source/600x600bb.jpg "485111/450617610")
{tag: Guitarist} {artist: Jimmie Vaughn}'s new album is {album: Plays More Blues, Ballads & Favorites}, and as the title suggests, the concept is pretty simple. This record has the former {artist: Thunderbird} playing the songs he grew up with - deep cuts of {genre: blues}, {genre: R&B} and {genre: country} - with accompaniment by guest {tag: vocalists} like {name: Lou Ann Barton}. In fact, {host: Jim} wishes Barton was more than just a guest. He finds the strongest tracks are the ones where she is singing, not Vaughn. So he gives the record a {tag: Burn It} rating. {host: Greg} really appreciates his guitar style-it's more terse and incisive than that of brother Stevie Ray. Kind of a "say it and get out" approach. Also, he appreciates the deep cuts on Plays More. Greg says {tag: Buy It}.
