## 00:01:44 Intro: Music News
Even decades after their heyday, there continues to be new, fun factoids in {artist: Beatles} history. One of their old {tag: concert contracts} from 1965 recently sold at {tag: auction} for {tag: $23,000}. But the contents were even more amazing. The {tag: Fab Four} state that they will "not be required to perform in front of a segregated audience." That was pretty radical for the time, and confirms the band's feelings about civil rights. Incidentally, {name: Ringo} also was contractually obligated to receive a special drumming platform.

In other Beatles news, {place: Abbey Road}, the famed British {tag: studio} where they recorded, is making attempts to stay vital in this age of laptop studios. For $800 you can send your own tracks into Abbey Road to have them mixed by professionals. All they require is a little guidance - are you going for The Clash? Or Barbra Streisand? In addition, they've launched an Abbey Road board game centered around the iconic zebra stripe road crossing.

## 00:06:26 Interview: Handsome Furs 
Sound Opinions continues its run with {tag: husband and wife duos}. We've had {artist: Low}, {artist: Damon & Naomi} and now {artist: Handsome Furs}. The {place: Montreal} {genre: electro-pop} act consists of {artist: Wolf Parade} {tag: guitarist} {name: Dan Boeckner} and his wife {name: Alexei Perry}. As they explain, the musical pairing came out of necessity more than anything. They just had no space to do their own solo projects. Now they're on their third album called {album: Sound Kapital}, which was inspired by Dan and Alexei's travels to Eastern Europe and Asia. There they discovered a vital underground music scene and a new brand of protest music. Those sounds and messages informed the tracks on Sound Kapital.

## 00:47:46 Review: St. Vincent
![Strange Mercy](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/304/27M0.jpg)

{artist: St. Vincent} has a new album out called {album: Strange Mercy}. The {tag: singer}, {tag: songwriter} and multi-{tag: instrumentalist}, also known as {name: Annie Clark}, visited Sound Opinions upon the release of her second album {album: Actor}. That ended up {host: Greg}'s top album of 2009. He's equally impressed with this effort, noting that she's blowing out the dynamics mix to a greater degree. The same goes for her guitar playing, which is at times unrecognizable. He loves the layers and the complicated storytelling and gives the record a {tag: Buy It}. {host: Jim} couldn't disagree more. He admits St. Vincent is unique and talented, but totally doesn't buy "the schtick." He finds her characters inauthentic and pretentious and says {tag: Trash It}.
