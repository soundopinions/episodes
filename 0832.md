As a solo performer and member of {artist : the Highwomen} supergroup, {artist : Brandi Carlile} has become a top-tier talent in Americana music. With her seventh album, {album : In These Silent Days}, Carlile has the attention of the music industry, but Jim and Greg have a mixed reaction to the record.



## 00:07:41 Review: Parquet Courts

![Parquet Courts Sympathy for Life](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/832/CT1.jpg)

{artist : Parquet Courts}' seventh album, {album : Sympathy For Life}, is more dance-oriented than their early work which garnered comparisons to {artist : Pavement}. Jim and Greg agree that the band brings something new to each album, but this one leaves Jim bored.
