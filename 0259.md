# Show 259: The Rock Doctors Go Shopping
Paging the {tag: Rock Doctors}! Jim and Greg help a listener in musical critical care. 

![Medicine](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/rockdocs/happymedicine.jpg)

## 00:01:52 Intro: Music News
For the third time defendant {name: Jammie Thomas-Rasset} has been ordered by a jury to pay damages for making 24 songs illegally available on her computer. First, the {tag: RIAA} offered Thomas-Rasset the option to settle for a couple thousand dollars. Then it went up to $222,000, $1.9 million and now $1.5 million. The recording industry has wanted to make an example out of the {place: Minnesota} mom, and it has succeeded.

The music industry has been eyeing video games as a potential source of revenue for the past couple of years. But since exploding onto the gaming scene, titles like {tag: *Rock Band*} and {tag: *Guitar Hero*} have actually declined in sales and popularity. They can't count on marketing tie-ins with the {artist: Beatles} forever, and so they turn to where it all began: music. The new {tag: *Rock Band 3*} can actually begin to teach you to play guitar, bass and keyboards with real instruments. This is great news to {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} who have long feared that thumbing controls would surpass strumming guitars for today's kid.

## 00:08:49 Rock Doctors: Cassie
Whenever {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} become the **{tag: Rock Doctors}** a different challenge is presented. They've had to consult with couples, families and have even staged an intervention. Now they enter the business world. [Cassie](http://www.greengrocerchicago.com/) is a store owner in Chicago who reached out to the Rock Doctors earlier this year. Cassie's problem: What to play in the shop? She tends to return to the same well of old pop and funk over and over again, and her employees are ready to strike. She wants a dose of new music that will keep customers happy and won't cause any eyerolls from the staff.

{host: Jim}'s prescription is {artist: The Budos Band III}. The Budos Band is an instrumental band recording on the {label: Daptone Records} label, which is also home to {artist: Sharon Jones} and {artist: Amy Winehouse}'s backing band {artist: The Dap-Kings}. Jim is confident that Cassie will appreciate their sound, which fuses old-school {genre: soul} with {genre: afro-beat}.

{host: Greg} prescribes Jim by {place: British} singer {artist: Jamie Lidell}. Greg praises Lidell's vocal style and live performances and thinks that this album will give Cassie the retro {genre: R&B} she loves, while keeping it fresh.

After playing both albums in her store for a couple of weeks Cassie returns to the show for a follow-up appointment. She has nothing but good things to say about Jim by {artist: Jamie Lidell}. It's upbeat, feel-good music that impressed her staff and got customers tapping their feet. She also really liked {artist: The Budos Band III}, and fancied herself in a {place: British} spy film. But, Cassie admits it did get repetitive, so she'll be mixing it in a playlist rather than putting the record on beginning to end. All in all, a healthy, happy patient.

## 00:32:52 Review: Cee Lo Green
![The Lady Killer (Deluxe Version)](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/259/1IS0.jpg)

{artist: Cee Lo Green} has evolved from {genre: hip hop} front man to soul crooner to "{track: Crazy}" guy, and his latest solo effort is called {album: The Lady Killer}. Many listeners will already be familiar with his angry viral hit {track: "F@*k You"}. And, the album is packed with even more oddball tracks. {host: Jim} [loves](http://www.wbez.org/blog/jim-derogatis/album-review-cee-lo-%e2%80%9c-lady-killer%e2%80%9d) the diversity of sounds and can't get enough of Cee Lo's voice. {host: Greg } [agrees](http://leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com/turn_it_up/2010/11/album-review-cee-lo-green-the-lady-killer.html), praising the more eccentric songs that don't follow the standard {genre: R&B} formula. {album: The Lady Killer} gets a double {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:42:46 Review: Brian Eno
![Small Craft On a Milk Sea (Bonus Track Version)](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/259/1ZA0.jpg)
In the Sound Opinions drinking game, "{artist: Brian Eno}" is the key word. Perhaps no name in rock gets dropped more than the pioneering {tag: producer}. But, for good reason-especially this week since he has a new album called {album: Small Craft on a Milk Sea}. Jim's "hero" has produced albums for the {artist: Talking Heads} and {artist: U2}, he's collaborated with {name: John Cale} and {name: Robert Fripp}, and he's been extremely influential in the worlds of experimental and ambient music. His new album is another instrumental effort. {host: Jim} wouldn't put it up there with Eno's best, but thinks it's a big step up from other recent recordings-especially if considered in the ambient context. He gives the record a {tag: Buy It} rating. {host: Greg} [heard](http://leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com/turn_it_up/2010/10/album-review-brian-eno-small-craft-on-a-milk-sea.html) moments of undeniable beauty, but he wasn't wowed. He says {tag: Burn It}.

## 00:49:46 DIJ: Greg
{artist: Bruce Springsteen} has a new box set out, and while this is of no interest to our own {place: Jersey} native (and Bruce-hater) {host: Jim} DeRogatis, Greg dove right in. It has numerous cuts from the {album: Darkness on the Edge of Town} era that didn't make the album, and as Greg explains, one of the recipients of Springsteen's prolific writing was the group {artist: Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes}. Like Springsteen, they defined the horns-filled, {genre: R&B}-influenced {place: Jersey Shore} sound-not to be confused with the Shore of today. It's a sound {host: Greg} wants with him in the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}, so he adds "{track: Talk to Me}" by {artist: Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes}.
