## 00:01:45 News: 2.15.08
Jim and Greg don't like to give too much airtime to the {tag: Grammy} Awards, but there was one upset worth mentioning (other than {artist: Amy Winehouse} not getting a visa). Beating out big names like Winehouse, {artist: Kanye West}, {artist: The Foo Fighters} and {artist: Vince Gill} for {tag: Album of the Year} was veteran {genre: jazz} musician {artist: Herbie Hancock}.

## 00:04:31 Review: Herbie Hancock
![River: The Joni Letters](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/6f/88/95/6f8895cd-aeae-b768-6fee-b997bc2f4f7d/source/600x600bb.jpg "51639/478192497")

So did Hancock deserve the award? {artist: Herbie Hancock} is a critically acclaimed pianist who many listeners will remember for composing the {era: 1983} jazz-{genre: hip hop} fusion track "{track: Rockit}." But, according to Greg, this is a case of "right artist, wrong year." Hancock's winning album {album: River: The Joni Letters} is by no means the musician's finest work. With the exception of the one track on which {artist: Joni Mitchell} sings, most of the songs have unsuccessful vocals. {host: Greg} gives this "muzak" album a {tag: Burn It}. {host: Jim} calls *River* a "stultifyingly mediocre record" that isn't a fair representation of the year in music. The Recording Academy might give the album an award, but he gives it a {tag: Trash It}.

## 00:11:29 Review: Juno Soundtrack
![Juno (Music from the Motion Picture)](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/18/1a/d4/181ad447-1719-b236-86f9-6d69578b1b29/source/600x600bb.jpg "36270/269736803")

Before {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} launch into their discussion of the best movie soundtracks of all time, they review the soundtrack that's currently getting the most buzz. {album: Juno}, the little movie that could, is not only a success at the box office, but with music consumers as well. The soundtrack became the first {label: Rhino} record to hit #1 on the Billboard chart, and it was even able to topple {artist: Alicia Keys}' recent release. The success of the {album: Juno} soundtrack is surprising considering how obscure many of the songs are. The album is dominated by tracks from {artist: The Moldy Peaches} and its former lead singer {artist: Kimya Dawson}. The success is also surprising to Jim because, well... he hates it. He's gone on record as not liking the movie, but Jim also thinks the album is completely unsuccessful. He finds Dawson's songwriting amateurish and childish gives the soundtrack a big {tag: Trash It}. {host: Greg} agrees, explaining that it doesn't seem like Dawson knows the difference between childlike and childish, or between cute and cloying. He says {album: Juno} is really tough to listen to and also gives the soundtrack a Trash It rating.
