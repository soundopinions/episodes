This week, {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} tackle {artist : Roxy Music}'s 1972 self-titled debut album.

Reaping from sources as varied as {genre : avant-garde electronic} composition, {genre : jazz}, {genre : Berlin cabaret}, glam rock, and American crooners, Roxy's hyper-eclectic style "didn't sound like anything else" in popular music in 1972, according to Greg. Ferry has cited the work of his mentor, pop collage artist {name : Richard Hamilton}, as an inspiration for his own catch-all musical aesthetic. As Greg observes, {album : Roxy Music} marked a new era in which "rock was a wide-open playing field, and you could do anything with it."

Critics took notice - the record was well-received upon its release and is frequently included on Best Album lists. Though the group went its separate ways in 1983, Roxy Music profoundly influenced musical genres to come, from {genre : post-punk} and the {genre : New Romantic} movement to {genre : Britpop}â€”and it can all be traced back to the group's delightfully wacky debut album.
