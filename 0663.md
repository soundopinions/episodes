Reaping from sources as varied as {genre: avant-garde electronic} composition, {genre: jazz}, {genre: Berlin cabaret}, glam rock, and American crooners, Roxy's hyper-eclectic style "didn't sound like anything else" in popular music in 1972, according to Greg. Ferry has cited the work of his mentor, pop collage artist {name: Richard Hamilton}, as an inspiration for his own catch-all musical aesthetic. As Greg observes, {album: Roxy Music} marked a new era in which "rock was a wide-open playing field, and you could do anything with it."
 
Critics took notice - the record was well-received upon its release and is frequently included on Best Album lists. Though the group went its separate ways in 1983, Roxy Music profoundly influenced musical genres to come, from {genre: post-punk} and the {genre: New Romantic} movement to {genre: Britpop}â€”and it can all be traced back to the group's delightfully wacky debut album.
