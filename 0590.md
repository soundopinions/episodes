## 00:30:11 Interview: Sunflower Bean
![Sunflower Bean](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2017/Sb.jpg)
Last year at {tag: South By Southwest}, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} discovered a young, talented {place: Brooklyn} {genre: rock} band called {artist: Sunflower Bean}. The group is made up of bassist and singer Julia Cumming, guitarist and singer Nick Kivlen and drummer Jacob Faber. What makes the members of Sunflower Bean so interesting is their pursuit of a career in rock music despite growing up in the home of hip hop and in the age of EDM. However, that doesn't mean they don't have diverse influences, channeling artists like {artist: Syd Barrett}, {artist: The Beach Boys} and {artist: Neu!} at times on their debut album {album: Human Ceremony}. Greg sat down to chat with the band when they were in Chicago, and they talked about musical influences, Sunflower Bean's origin and how the group held the title of most shows played in New York City in 2014. Plus, they'll give a fun live performance.
