## 00:01:47 News: 4.19.2013
Certainly record companies have made many attempts over the years to launch their artists to #1. But, as far as we know, that's never been attempted by a political social media campaign, until now. The {tag: Facebook} page "Make {track: Ding Dong! the Witch is Dead} Number One the Week Thatcher Dies" went live shortly after the death of former {tag: British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher}. And it almost succeeded, but was narrowly inched out by {artist: Duke Dumont}'s ["Need U (100%)."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgTB1ay_nnA) Even at #2, this has caused some controversy. The {tag: BBC} [decided](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/aboutthebbc/posts/Statement-regarding-Radio-1s-Chart-Show-14-April-2013) not to play the {tag: *Wizard of Oz*} tune during its chart countdown, instead opting to play a clip as part of a newscast.

The Iron Lady has always had an impact on music, particularly when it came to hear naysayers. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} discuss some of the 1980's best anti-Thatcher tunes including {artist: The English Beat} with ["{track: Stand Down Margaret},"]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K6YWX4OL0o) {artist: Elvis Costello} with ["{track: Tramp the Dirt Down},"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=9t4-zDem1Sk) {artist: Crass} with ["{track: How Does It Feel}?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=mIDdvnHQrjk) and perhaps the darkest of them all, ["{track: Margaret on the Guillotine}"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=hsq3H_6XuFA) by [{artist: Moz}](http://exclaim.ca/News/morrissey_pens_open_letter_on_thatcher_media_coverage_accuses_british_government_of_dictatorship_tactics).

## 00:06:11 Interview: Kurt Vile
First there was the myth of {genre: blues} legend {artist: Robert Johnson} meeting the devil. Now we have the myth of a fork lift driver turned guitar virtuoso and poet. But as {artist: Kurt Vile} explains, his rise to success has actually been quite slow and methodical. After leaving the band {artist: The War on Drugs}, he has released five albums and earned the respect of music peers (not to mention a reputation for being an A+ rock student). His latest is called {album: Wakin on a Pretty Daze}. 

## 00:44:05 Review: Phoenix
![Bankrupt! (Deluxe Edition)](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/02/72/29/0272292e-9d78-e029-cc7d-44fa97206725/source/600x600bb.jpg "5500360/599818944")

It's been four years since the French {genre: electropop} band {artist: Phoenix} [dropped by](http://www.soundopinions.org/show/204/) Sound Opinions to play those infectious breakout singles "{track: Lisztomania}" and "{track: 1901}." For most American music fans, those tracks and the band's 2009 breakthrough album, [{album: Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix}](show/185/review/phoenix), came out of nowhere (savvy French fans would've known the band's previous collaborations with {artist: Air} and {artist: Daft Punk}). Phoenix's latest album, {album: Bankrupt!}, isn't nearly so under the radar. But does it measure up to the hype? Greg doesn't hear a single as strong as "Lisztomania" or "1901," but insists the album may fare better overall. Frontman {name: Thomas Mars} was inspired by his wife {name: Sofia Coppola}'s 2010 film {tag: Somewhere}, giving the album a theme. And, more ambient and {genre: R&B}-inspired tracks show the band is evolving musically. {host: Greg} says {tag: Buy It}. But {host: Jim} can't get over the lack of a hits. This is fine bubbly dance {genre: pop} for summer, he says, but {album: Bankrupt!} is only a {tag: Burn It}.


## 00:50:42 DIJ: Greg
A tour and a raft of new reissues have got {host: Greg} thinking about {artist: Shuggie Otis} again. A {tag: guitar} prodigy, Shuggie got his start in father {artist: Johnny Otis}'s band at the tender age of fifteen. Just a few years later, he dropped the band gig to explore more {genre: avant-garde} and atmospheric territory, making some of the most genre-defying guitar music of the seventies. Greats like {artist: Al Cooper} and {artist: Frank Zappa} clamored to work with him, but by the mid '70s, Shuggie had largely dropped off the musical map. Luckily, songs like Greg's DIJ pick, ["{track: Strawberry Letter 23}"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAPPAJ1sT8g) haven't grown stale with age. Thanks to renewed interest, Shuggie's back on tour. Listen to Strawberry Letter's {genre: psychedelic} glockenspiel and guitar solos, and you might just be inspired to check him out live.
