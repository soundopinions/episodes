## 00:48:46 Review: Belle & Sebastian
![Write About Love (Bonus Track Version)](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/60/22/8b/60228bbe-89c4-593b-8365-641a8857d137/source/600x600bb.jpg "2989382/391817162")
For their latest release {album: Write About Love}, Scots {artist: Belle & Sebastian} have yet again traded rainy {place: Glasgow} for sunny {place: Los Angeles}. On their last release, {album: The Life Pursuit}, this sun translated into a more upbeat dance record. But, now they have returned to their orchestral folk roots, and {host: Greg} wishes they had continued moving forward with their sound, rather than backwards. He appreciates singer {name: Stuart Murdoch}'s vocals and witty lyrics, but this feels like a retreat. Greg gives {album: Write About Love} a {tag: Burn It} rating. {host: Jim} thinks Greg hasn't been this wrong in a long time. He agrees that {album: The Life Pursuit} was a welcome change of pace, but really loves this album as well. It is toned down, but not precious and more full of edge. Simply put, {album: Write About Love} puts Jim in a great mood and he gives the record a {tag: Buy It}.
