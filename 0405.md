## 00:01:49 News: 8-30-2013
This week's World Tour takes {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} to {place: South Africa}. But first, they've got a layover in {place: Mali}. {name: Christopher Kirkley} is the founder of the [{label: SahelSounds}](SahelSounds) record label, where he's been releasing recordings of Malian ["cell phone music."](http://sahelsounds.bandcamp.com/album/music-from-saharan-cellphones) Jim and Greg ask Christopher about the recent arrival of legal digital music services in {place: West Africa}. Can streaming services like {tag: iRoking}, {tag: Deezer}, and The Kleek gain a foothold with African music fans? Kirkley says low income in {place: West Africa} make paid streaming subscriptions a non-starter. And besides, he points out, West Africans already have a thriving music-sharing network: they're swapping digital music on their phones. [Check out](http://sahelsounds.bandcamp.com/) some of the Malian cell phone music Christopher has collected.

## 00:11:38 World Tour: South Africa
The **Sound Opinions World Tour** has been to [Sweden](/show/379), [Japan](/show/388), and [Mexico](/show/396). This week, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} finally touch down in the {place: Africa}n Continent – {place: South Africa} to be exact. Their field guide is {name: Andy Davis}, editor of the {place: South African} music and culture website *{tag: Mahala}*. Andy confesses that his first record was {artist: The Boss}'s {album: Born in the U.S.A.}, but he says he quickly embraced the music of his homeland with a little help from {artist: Johnny Clegg} and the Queen of Afropop, {artist: Brenda Fassie}. Davis says what's special about South African music is its "hybridization": the way musicians combine traditional guitars, rhythms, and vocals with synths and global genres like {genre: hip-hop}. The result is a music scene varied enough to include rap in {tag: Afrikaans} and {tag: Xhosa}, South African {genre: house}, and {genre: folk-pop} about the {tag: apartheid} struggle.

To find out what it's like to be a band in {place: South Africa} post-apartheid, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} speak to rising {place: Cape Town} act {artist: John Wizards}. The two main men behind the band are {name: John Withers}, a white South African from Cape Town, and {name: Emmanuel Nazaramba}, a black Rwandan. The two men met outside a café in Cape Town, and despite their differing musical backgrounds, John says his tracks and Emmanuel's vocals clicked right away

## 00:49:08 DIJ: Jim
{host: Jim's} list of favorite {genre: country} tunes runs short, but he's got a soft spot for {artist: Bobby Gentry}'s {genre: country-pop} crossover hit "{track: Ode to Billie Joe}". A story-song about what happened one fateful evening on the {place: Choctaw Ridge} and the {place: Tallahassee Bridge}, "{track: Ode to Billie Joe}" revolves around one central question: what did Billie Joe toss into the river before he killed himself? Stranded on the Desert Island, Jim has plenty of time to ponder that mystery.
