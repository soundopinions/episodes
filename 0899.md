# Show 899: Sinéad O'Connor & Opinions on Lil Yachty

In 1992, Sinéad O’Connor was at the peak of her commercial success when she spoke out against the Pope on Saturday Night Live. After that, she encountered a massive backlash, but never backed down. Hosts Jim DeRogatis and Greg Kot talk to documentary filmmaker Kathryn Ferguson about the music, career and activism of Sinéad O’Connor. They also review the new album from rapper Lil Yachty. Join our Facebook Group: https://bit.ly/3sivr9TBecome a member on Patreon: https://bit.ly/3slWZvcSign up for our newsletter: https://bit.ly/3eEvRnGMake a donation via PayPal: https://bit.ly/3dmt9lUSend us a Voice Memo: Desktop: bit.ly/2RyD5Ah  Mobile: sayhi.chat/soundops Featured Songs:Sinéad O'Connor, "Nothing Compares 2 U," I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got, Ensign/Chrysalis, 1990The Beatles, "With A Little Help From My Friends," Sgt.
