## 00:00:41 Review: The Handsome Family

![The Handsome Family Hollow](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/933/1512.jpg)

The Americana gothic group, {artist : The Handsome Family}, hadn't released a new album in seven years, before their new one, {album : Hollow}. Jim and Greg are smitten once again with the work of Brett and Rennie Sparks.



## 00:06:52 Review: Lydia Loveless

![Lydia Loveless Nothings Gonna Stand in My Way Again](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/933/BG1.jpg)

{artist : Lydia Loveless} had a breakthrough with their previous album, Daughter. Now they're following that work with {album : Nothing's Gonna Stand In My Way Again}. It's an unflinching self-examination that gets into Lydia's struggle with alcoholism.
