Whether it's a stylistic choice or born out of necessity, sometimes great songs aren’t sung, they’re spoken. This week, hosts Jim DeRogatis and Greg Kot share some of their favorite tracks featuring speak-singing vocals. Plus, they hear selections from the production staff, review the new album from Spoon, and bid farewell to Mark Lanegan.
