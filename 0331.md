# Show 331: The Kills & Reviews of Madonna and Dr. John
{name: Alison Mosshart} and {name: Jamie Hince} of The Kills bring their blend of blues grit, melodic vocals and drum-machine beats. Later Jim and Greg review new albums by the "Queen of Pop," {artist: Madonna} and the "Night Tripper," {artist: Dr. John}.

## 00:01:45 Intro: Music News
Closing out a pair of {tag: antitrust suits} in play for nearly a decade, a {tag: federal judge} granted {tag: Live Nation}'s motion for summary judgment in cases pertaining to the {place: Los Angeles} and {place: Denver} markets. Beginning in 2002, class action suits were filed against {tag: Clear Channel}, which merged with Live Nation in 2010, alleging that their promotion policies were {tag: monopolistic}. Jim, Greg and many independent promoters would agree, but the judge found the plaintiff's expert testimony flawed. So for now it will continue to be big business as usual for Live Nation.

{tag: Mad Men} fans have mixed feelings about Don Draper's marriage to young Megan. But, no one will deny that her birthday performance of "{track: Zou Bisou Bisou}" during the Season 5 opener was a standout scene. And now the song has been released as a digital single on {tag: iTunes}, and soon as a limited edition vinyl on {tag: AMC}'s website. Jim would also point listeners to {artist: Sophia Loren}'s version {tag:  produced} by {name: George Martin}. But of course, the breakout musical star from the series may prove to be John Slattery.

## 00:07:55 Interview: The Kills
It seems unlikely that a {tag: punk singer} from {place: Florida} and a {tag: blues guitarist} from {place: England} would link up, but lucky for us they did. {name: Alison Mosshart} and {name: Jamie Hince} formed {artist: The Kills} over a decade ago, and 4 albums later, they've perfected a mix of gritty, soulful blues with minimalist punk rock elements, all with just two musicians and a drum machine. As Jamie explains, that setup began as a practical, money-saving decision, but it's one they favor to this day. In more surprising fashion, they're also loyal to their {tag: recording studio} in {place: Benton Harbor, MI}. Jamie says the lack of atmosphere keeps them on track. And Alison, who moonlights with {name: Jack White} and {artist: The Dead Weather}, admits to a fondness for the Meijers social scene.

## 00:42:37 Review: Madonna
![MDNA (Deluxe Version)](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/331/1Z10.jpg)

No other {genre: dance pop} artist has been at it successfully for as long as {artist: Madonna}. With a career spanning 30 years and 300 million albums sold worldwide, she's earned the title "{tag: Queen of Pop}." However, with royal status, should come different expectations. No longer is Madonna on the cutting edge, as critics of her new album {album: MDNA} have complained. But that's okay, says Greg. She's still able to bring personality, especially on the songs {tag: produced} by {name: William Orbit} of {track: Ray of Light} fame. But Orbit only tackles half the record, so {host: Greg} gives MDNA a {tag: Burn It}. Jim knows Greg thinks it's foolish to criticize Madonna's lyrics, but her music used to have conceptual strength in addition to pop power. Now she just goes on about being a bad girl...and at the age of 53. {host: Jim} says {tag: Trash It}.

## 00:49:54 Review: Dr. John
![Locked Down](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/331/2B60.jpg)
In the late '60s and early '70s, nobody sounded quite like {artist: Dr. John}. And now on {album: Locked Down}, {name: Mac Rebennack} has returned to that psychedelic, voodoo, Gris Gris, gumbo vibe, thanks in large part to {place: producer} {name: Dan Auerbach} of {artist: The Black Keys}. Jim loves the use of bass and African drums, and never has the farfesa organ sounded dirtier or better. Greg agrees, noting that the Dr. is best when he's in the zone and almost speaking in tongues. For new or old fans of Dr. John, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} give Locked Down a {tag: Buy It}.
