## 00:48:50 Review:  Donnie Trumpet & The Social Experiment
![Donnie Trumpet](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2015/socialexperiment-surf.jpg)
Out now is a debut for the new collective {artist: Donnie Trumpet & the Social Experiment}.  {album: Surf} smoothly combines {genre: rap}, {genre: soul} and {genre: pop} as well as it seamlessly blends its different musicians. {name: Chance the Rapper}'s childhood pal {artist: Donnie Trumpet} fronts the band. Although Chance is the big name, he appears on fewer than half the tracks. That's not a problem for {host: Greg}. He thinks the record's sonics showcase a variety of sounds, musicians and friendships. Greg is even inticed by the fact they have big name rappers laying down rhymes over a harp. He gives it a {tag: Buy It}. {host: Jim} agrees, adding that {album: Surf} showcases light and positivity present in neighborhoods where violence is all too prevalent. He calls it "inspired and brilliant," and says {tag: Buy It}.
