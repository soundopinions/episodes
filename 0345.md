# Show 345: Summer Record Review Roundup
In the past weeks, Greg and Jim's inboxes have filled up with new releases. Tune in as they review them during our Summer Record Review Roundup.

## 00:01:44 News: 7.6.2012
We might say "if it ain't broke, don't fix it." But we don't work for {tag: Apple}. Sources within the company say {tag: iTunes}, the world's biggest music store, is scheduled for an overhaul by the end of the year. Among the proposed changes are streamlining the process for syncing content across Apple devices and making it easier to share tracks with friends. Chalk it up to Apple's "never stop improving" spirit, or the need to compete with {tag: Spotify}.

Nothing says "Olympic spirit" like overwrought strings, a male chorus, and lyrics like "Life's a race / and I'm gonna win." At least {artist: Muse} lead singer {name: Matthew Bellamy} seems to think so. The band's new single "{track: Survival}" was recently selected as the official track for the {tag: London Olympic} games, a decision Greg calls outrageous given the breadth of talent that city has to offer. Almost any song, he says, would have been an improvement.

To the list of things you associate with {artist: Weezer} and {artist: Dinosaur Jr. }(teen angst, alienation, etc.) add {place: Caribbean} beaches and drinks in coconuts. The bands recently headlined the {tag: Weezer Cruise} on the {tag: Carnival Destiny}, and they aren't the only rockers taking to the seas this season. Rock cruises, {tag: Billboard} {tag: editor} {name: Joe Levy} points out in a {tag: New York Times} article, have become a profitable and growing corner of the cruise and music industries. Once the domain of legacy acts like {artist: Frankie Avalon} (his "Malt Shop Memories" cruise is still going strong) rock cruises are now welcoming aboard hipper acts like {artist: F'ed Up}, {artist: The Antlers}, and {artist: Yuck}. Joe talks to Jim and Greg about his experience aboard the Weezer cruise (awkward, yet awesome) and explains what's in it for fans and artists.

## 00:11:48 Review: Patti Smith
![Banga](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/fd/53/e3/fd53e331-6e87-b6ee-f6a1-fe3fd491f3a3/source/600x600bb.jpg "13762/529605595")

In the past weeks Jim and Greg's inboxes have filled up with new records. This week, they award buy it, burn it, and trash it ratings to five of them. First up, punk godmother {artist: Patti Smith}. The poetess behind {album: Horses} and {album: Radio Ethiopia} is back with her eleventh studio album, {album: Banga}. Recorded off and on between gallery showings and book readings, Banga, Greg says, is a meditation on the call of art. It's also a tour of global music styles. "We were going to see the world," Smith intones in the leadoff track "{track: Amerigo}," and she doesn't let us down. Different tracks draw inspiration from free {genre: jazz}, {genre: do-wop}, {genre: celtic folk}, and {genre: blues}. {host: Greg} says Buy It. {host: Jim} agrees. This album is up there with Patti's best work, not the least because, Jim says, she seems to really be having fun. Double {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:21:20 Review: Bobby Womack
![The Bravest Man In the Universe (Expanded Edition)](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/60/1f/03/601f034d-5d29-df03-620e-ce4b8157ab4a/source/600x600bb.jpg "503682/609127619")

Like Patti Smith, {artist: Bobby Womack}'s got a storied musical history. He played with {artist: Sam Cooke} in the sixties, was a session musician for {artist: Aretha Franklin} and {artist: Sly Stone}, and finally made a name for himself as a solo artist with classic {genre: R&B} albums like {album: Communication} and {album: The Facts of Life} in the seventies. Unfortunately addiction dragged him down and by the nineties Womack was a musical nonentity. With {album: The Bravest Man in the Universe}, Womack announces his comeback. He's cleaned up and is working with {tag: producer} {name: Damon Albarn} of {artist: Blur}. Womack and Albarn have played it smart, {host: Jim} says, by not living in the past. The electronic soul tracks Albarn's created for Womack don't sound vintage in the slightest. The themes might be familiar - Womack sings from the point of view of a man who done wrong - but the music is challenging and fresh. {host: Greg} agrees. While he wishes Albarn and Womack hadn't turned over quite so many tracks to guests like {artist: Lana Del Rey}, he's loving Womack's sandpapery voice. Double {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:28:45 Review: Ty Segall
![Slaughterhouse](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/41/TySegallBandSlaughterhouse.jpg/220px-TySegallBandSlaughterhouse.jpg "528041872/528041795")
{artist: Ty Segall} may have made a name for himself as a low-fi bedroom recording artist, but don't mistake him for the moody quiet type. This {place: California} garage rocker is loud! {album: Slaughterhouse} is his first release with his own band, and both Jim and Greg agree: this is a ferocious dirty record. It's hard, Greg says, to find artists who do both noise and melody well, but Ty is one of them. On Slaughterhouse, extreme noise and melody battle it out for half an hour. The ten-minute track of fuzzed out drone that ends the record reminds {host: Greg} of surveying a battlefield. {host: Jim} agrees. Ty might call this "evil space rock," but for him, it's masterful garage rock overlaid with Brit pop melodies. Another double {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:34:36 Review: Best Coast
![Crazy for You](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music69/v4/0e/71/7b/0e717b52-d8df-aebe-3eec-8dfafc21a048/source/600x600bb.jpg "338552024/1072984838")

Also from {place: California} - and proudly so - is {artist: Best Coast}. The band's debut album was the much buzzed about {album: Crazy For You}, a hit fueled as much by {artist: Beach Boys} {genre: pop} as it was by lead singer {name: Bethany Cosentino}'s intense homesickness (she was in a band in New York for a time). Jim says that Best Coast's sophomore album, {album: The Only Place}, might come under fire for being simply more of the same. That might be true, if by "same" you mean it's another album of indelibly catchy pop. But he also points out the darkness of Beth's lyrics this time around. She's singing about her desire to be loved for who she is, and as Greg points out, she's doing so sincerely and movingly. Both {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} agree this is summery pop at its best. They say {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:43:25  Review: Neneh Cherry
![The Cherry Thing](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/15/b7/2d/15b72dbe-c87b-c7dc-85e1-308a42b26f19/source/600x600bb.jpg "524545/527939149")

For their final review, Jim and Greg turn to {artist: Neneh Cherry} and her collaboration with Norwegian/Swedish {genre: jazz} band {artist: The Thing}. While Cherry's best known for her {genre: hip-hop} inflected single "{track: Buffalo Stance}," jazz is in her musical DNA. Her stepfather, {name: Don Cherry}, was a renowned jazz {tag: trumpeter}, and Neneh's first band, {album: Rip Rig + Panic}, attempted to merge free jazz with a punk sensibility. Still Greg admits, it was hard to imagine how Cherry's voice and {name: Mats Gustafsson} 's freewheeling {tag: sax} could work together on her latest album, {album: The Cherry Thing}. He was pleasantly surprised. Cherry's voice is a versatile instrument. She samples hip-hop and trip hop styles and channels everyone from {artist: Billie Holiday} to {artist: Yoko Ono}. Still {host: Jim} says this album is unquestionably Cherry's, a feat even more impressive considering the material is almost all covers. This is a woman who can sing Iggy Stooge's "Dirt" and make it her own. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} both say {tag: Buy It}, making this an especially feel-good episode of Sound Opinions.

## 00:51:16 DIJ: Jim
It's all aboard the rock cruise to the desert island. For this week's {tag: Desert Island Jukebox} pick, {host: Jim} was inspired by Neneh Cherry's first band, {artist: Rip Rig + Panic}. They weren't the only post-punk band in the eighties playing at the intersection of jazz and rock. British band {artist: Blue Rondo a la Turk} was a fellow traveler. Jim caught their set at the {place: Peppermint Lounge} as a kid, and their hit "{track: Me and Mr. Sanchez}" became a go-to party record for him. The track not only merges punk and jazz, but adds a pinch of Latin spice.
