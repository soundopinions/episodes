## 00:00:41 Review: Björk

![Bjrk Fossora](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/882/151.jpg)

{artist: Björk} has sold millions of albums and influenced a generation of artists. Her new album {album: Fossora} continues her embrace of avant garde and operatic sounds. Jim and Greg split in their opinion of Fossora. 


## 00:08:26 Review: Yeah Yeah Yeahs

![Yeah Yeah Yeahs Cool It Down](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/882/E212.jpg)

{artist: Yeah Yeah Yeahs} were at the center of the New York scene in the early 2000s. Now it’s been almost a decade since their last album. {album: Cool It Down} is a slight effort at only 8 tracks and moves away from guitars for a more dance-oriented sound.


## 00:16:21 Feature: Pearl Jam
![pearl](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2022/long-road-pearl-jam-and-the-soundtrack-of-a-generation.jpeg)

{tag: Steven Hyden} joins Jim and Greg for the most in depth conversation on {artist: Pearl Jam} ever on Sound Opinions. The band’s battle with {tag: Ticketmaster} is recounted in detail, including the conflicting feelings of band members at the time. Hyden points out that by all logic, Pearl Jam should have imploded years ago- yet they are still going strong, packing stadiums wherever they perform.
