## 00:01:45 News: 11.26.2010
The {tag: digital music} site {tag: eMusic} has angered some listeners and labels in recent weeks. They moved from subscriptions to a tiered pricing model similar to {tag: iTunes} that will include higher priced major label songs. After making this announcement, three of the biggest indie labels in the business decided to take their music elsewhere. {label: Domino Records}, {label: Merge Records} and the {tag: Beggars Group}, which includes {label: Matador}, {label: XL}, {label: Rough Trade} and {label: 4AD}, have not elaborated on their decision to leave, but {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} suspect it's because of this new deal with major labels. In their statement, eMusic explained that this change was necessary for their long-term sustainability.

What's the best music town in the country? Some would say {place: Chicago}; some would say {place: Seattle}; but according to {tag: Songkick.com}, it's {place: Austin}, {place: Texas}. {place: Austin} has always touted itself as the live music capital of the world, and now they've got this to back it up. In their survey of live shows per capita, Songkick also put {place: Madison}, {place: New Orleans}, {place: Las Vegas} and {place: Denver} in their Top 5. Some surprising winners, especially when you scan down to find that {place: New York} and {place: L.A.} didn't even make the cut. And it's interesting to note that these cities had lower average ticket prices than bigger markets.

It's time for the annual Sound Opinions {tag: Thanksgiving Turkey Shoot}! It's the perfect way to say thanks...thanks that we never have to listen to the year's biggest musical turkeys again.

## 00:39:55 Review: Bruce Springsten

![The Promise: The Darkness On the Edge of Town Story](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2017/brucespringsteen-darknessontheedge-cover_1329051416_resize_460x400.jpg)
{artist: Bruce Springsteen} fans are always hungry for more of {tag: The Boss}, and they get it with the release of a new box set, {album: The Promise: The Darkness on the Edge of Town Story}. But what about folks who don't belong to the "Cult of Springsteen"? {host: Greg} loved hearing the reissue of the {era: 1978} album. The previously unheard recordings illustrate Springsteen's sound right after his hit {album: Born to Run}. It's a mix of the romanticism of that record and the leaner, meaner rock of *Darkness*. Greg gives it a {tag: Buy It} rating. Sound Opinions listeners know {host: Jim} is no Bruce-lover, but he counts *Darkness* as one of the better albums. Going back to these unreleased tracks, it's even clearer what an anomaly it was. The songs on the {album: The Promise} reissue are full of the {album: Born to Run} era, over-the-top schmaltz. So Jim says {tag: Trash It}.

## 00:47:51 Review: Sharon Van Etten
![Epic](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/07/35/68/0735685e-6be7-6b50-62a2-d55df4f7971a/source/600x600bb.jpg "314263775/389598833")
{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} both saw singer-songwriter {artist: Sharon Van Etten} perform at this past year's {tag: Pitchfork Music Festival}. And while {host: Jim} was unimpressed, Greg highly anticipated this new album, {album: Epic}, which does not disappoint. Van Etten's first record was largely about a troubled relationship. On this one, Van Etten is much stronger and more confident, even in her orchestrations. Despite Jim's feelings about Van Etten's Pitchfork show, he loves this album â€“ all seven songs of it. Very few women in indie rock have pipes like this singer. {album: Epic} gets a double {tag: Buy It}.
