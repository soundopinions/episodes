Like a little kid waiting for {tag: Santa}, Sound Opinions eagerly awaits the arrival of Andy Cirzan.

{name: Andy Cirzan} is the show's official Kris Kringle, bringing in the coolest and weirdest {tag: holiday} music on the block. By day, Andy is a longtime Vice President at [Jam Productions](http://jamusa.com/) in {place: Chicago}. But by night, he scours high and low to add to his collection of {tag: Christmas} obscura. Andy has been treating his friends to a holiday music compilation of these rare finds for 30 years. And, for half of those, he has also shared them with Sound Opinions. Now we can make Andy's highly sought after compilation available for free to all our listeners.

This year's mix is titled *Rudolph Pouts...and Pouts Again. The Hits Pt.1*, featuring rare holiday tunes across the musical spectrum.

To the right you can download this year's album and its art. But get it while the yule log is hot...**The 2018 mix will only be available until midnight on January 1, 2019**.

[**And in exchange for this free gift, we hope you'll consider a stocking stuffer contribution to Sound Opinions.**](http://soundopinions.org/support) 

Enjoy and Happy Holidays!
