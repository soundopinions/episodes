## 00:01:53 News: 10.1.2010
With CD sales down by 50%, the music industry has been counting on digital [sales](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4b5a3c80-c998-11df-b3d6-00144feab49a.html), which have been climbing steadily for the past few years. But now, according to {tag: Nielsen}, digital sales have stalled. Most analysts attribute previously high sales to consumers wanting to replace their physical music with digital files. But now most people have digitized their collection and the flurry of sales have ended. {host: Jim} thinks it might just be the music.

[{artist: Lil Wayne}](http://www.lilwayne-online.com/) recently released a digital album called{album:  I Am Not A Human Being}...weeks before his CD "drops"...and from jail! The rapper, who made his name through self-released mixtapes, has always embraced the digital realm. But brick and mortar stores are not happy about this trend. 

In the past royalty organizations only needed to worry about radio, and perhaps, television. Ah, the good old days. Now there are tons of internet streaming sites, and a federal appeals court admits it's more complicated than once thought. A recent [ruling](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/sns-music-streaming-royalties,0,4925036.story), involving {tag: Yahoo/Real Networks} and [{tag: ASCAP}](http://www.ascap.com/press/2010/0929_Court_Decision.aspx), says that a lower court's method for calculating music royalties is flawed; streaming royalties shouldn't be the same as radio. This decision is significant, as {host: Greg} explains. Had it gone the other way, many music sites would either start charging or make less music available to fans.

## 00:07:52 Interview: Michael Rother
Our guest this week might not be a familiar name to most. But, [{name: Michael Rother}](http://www.michaelrother.de/) is one of the most innovative figures in rock. Along with {name: Klaus Dinger}, he formed [{artist: Neu!}](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=1:NEU!) and created three hugely influential albums in the {era: 1970's}. They were part of a great wave of {place: German} {genre: art rock} of that period and continue to be name checked by everyone from {artist: Wilco} to {artist: Sonic Youth} to {artist: U2}. Rother talks to [{host: Jim}](http://blogs.vocalo.org/jderogatis/2010/09/neu-riding-through-the-night-and-stopping-chicago-this-evening/36317) and [Greg](http://leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com/turn_it_up/2010/09/neu-is-cool-35-years-after-revolutionizing-rock.html) about his solo work and his time with {artist: Neu!}. The band's back catalog is now available in a limited edition [box set](http://www.neu2010.com/), and Rother is touring the country with a new band under the name [{artist: Hallogallo 2010}](http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=131220155&blogId=530885231).

## 00:41:43 Review: Robyn
![Body Talk, Pt. 2](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/c6/4d/15/c64d15f9-708f-509e-3435-e8067fd60b8f/source/600x600bb.jpg "535211/387460241")
Swedish {genre: pop} artist [{artist: Robyn}](http://www.robyn.com/) has been making music since she was a teenager. You might think of her as {place: Sweden}'s answer to {artist: Britney Spears}. But, she has since gone {genre: indie} and edgy and began releasing a three part series called {album: Body Talk} last year. {album: Body Talk, Pt. 2} feels like a full album to [{host: Jim}](http://blogs.vocalo.org/jderogatis/2010/09/album-review-robyn-%e2%80%9cbody-talk-pt-2%e2%80%9d/37762). He loves her maturity and experimentation, noting that {artist: Robyn} has even managed to make {artist: Snoop Dogg} sound original. He gives it a {tag: Buy It} rating. {host: Greg} agrees, and prompts {artist: Katy Perry }to pay attention: This is how you make smart pop music. He doesn't hear anything as catchy as {album: Body Talk Pt 1}'s "[{track: Dancing on My Own}](http://vimeo.com/11925060)," but also gives the 2nd round a Buy It.

## 00:49:15 Review: Superchunk
![Majesty Shredding](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/bd/90/33/bd903375-3380-04a2-0296-807f9b49c41e/source/600x600bb.jpg "3647724/387974874")
Perhaps no band better symbolizes the indie rock underground than [{artist: Superchunk}](/show/269/). They have been committed to being "{genre: indie}" both in terms of sound and practice since forming in {place: Chapel Hill} in {era: 1989}. Two of its members have gone on to run [{label: Merge Records}](http://www.mergerecords.com/), home to [{artist: Arcade Fire}](/show/290/) and [{artist: Spoon}](/show/102/). While they never officially broke up, the band hasn't released an album in almost a decade. [{album: Majesty Shredding}](http://www.mergerecords.com/store/store_detail.php?catalog_id=717) is worth the wait according to {host: Greg}. They do pop rock as good as anyone, and {name: Mac McCaughan} still sings with the enthusiasm of a kid. [{host: Jim}](http://blogs.vocalo.org/jderogatis/2010/09/album-review-superchunk-majesty-shredding/37592) agrees, adding that they did lose the plot for a little while. He's happy to hear they have returned to form - simple exuberance - and Superchunk gets a double {tag: Buy It}.
