# Show 589: One and Done & Opinions on Thundercat

![One and Done](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2017/oneanddone_web.jpg)

Some artists deliver a fantastic debut album, yet never make another LP again. {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} select some of their favorite "{tag : one and done}" bands and explore what makes these one-album wonders so great. Plus, a review of the new record from multi-genre bassist {artist : Thundercat}.



## 00:01:45 Intro: Music News

{host : Jim} and {host : Greg} are getting ready for the {tag : SXSW Music Conference} in {place : Austin}, but there is [already controversy brewing at the festival](http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-sxsw-to-amend-immigration-policy-20170303-column.html) before they even arrive. {tag : SXSW} has come under fire for language in its performance agreement with international artists that says the festival will notify U.S. immigrations authorities if the bands play unofficial shows. The language has been in the contract for years, but in the wake of the Trump administration's travel ban, some artists have threatened to boycott the festival. [SXSW responded with a statement](https://www.sxsw.com/sxsw-statement-regarding-commitment-international-artists/) saying that it publicly opposes the executive orders and will remove the language for next year's festival.

## 00:44:04 Review: Thundercat

![Drunk](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/589/21G0.jpg)

{name : Stephen Bruner}, better know as {artist : Thundercat}, is an in-demand session bassist. A resume containing artists from {artist : Kendrick Lamar} to {artist : Suicidal Tendencies} is testament to that. Thundercat is also a songwriter in his own right and has just released his third album, {album : Drunk}. Weighing in at 23 tracks, {host : Greg} says it is a challenging listen. With references to j{genre : azz fusion}, {artist : Earth, Wind and Fire}, and cameos from {artist : Kenny Loggins} and {artist : Michael McDonald} he admits the album is "bewildering," especially as Thundercat vacillates from introspective songs about mortality and police brutality, to shopping for anime in Tokyo. But, Greg says it is an "audio-veritae" of Thundercat's life, that shows virtuosity and personality. That said, Greg stops short of saying Buy It and instead gives it a {tag : Try It} and he eagerly awaits what is next from Thundercat.{host : Jim}, had a much more visceral reaction to this record saying he "despises it" and claiming it left him with a skin rash (Editor's Note: we didn't verify this). He says the album is full of "pointless busyness" as Thundercat tries to cram too many ideas into his music. It goes without saying, Jim gives it a {tag : Trash It}.



## 00:51:08 DIJ: Jim

{artist : Thundercat} left a bad taste in {host : Jim}'s mouth but it did get him thinking about other artists that could be considered {genre : alternative hip hop}. And the band that came to his mind was one that has never been discussed on Sound Opinions: {artist : Arrested Development}. The socially conscious {genre : hip hop} collective garnered huge critical and commercial success with its first album 3 Years, 5 Months And 2 Days In The Life Ofâ€¦ but never captured that same praise again despite a long recording career.  Jim says the message and the melody of the {era : 1992} track {track : Tennessee} secures its slot in the Desert Island Jukebox.
