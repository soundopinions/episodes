## 00:01:45 Intro: Music News

{host : Jim} and {host : Greg} start the show by warning listeners that their tax-free downloading days might soon be over. With e-commerce sales exceeding $130 billion a year, and iTunes sales hitting $5 billion, it was only a matter of time before the states started to want a piece. This year nine states have considered digital download taxes, and five of those have already enacted them into law. Certain purchases will never be subject to {tag : tax} if the vendor doesn't have a physical presence in that state, but the bigger issue is that whether it's through taxes on sales, taxes on file-sharing, or taxes on internet usage, the government's going to get its piece of the pie.

{artist : Isaac Hayes} died earlier this week at the age of 65. As Jim and Greg reveal, the self-taught musician started out as a songwriter at {label : Stax Records} in the {era : early '60s}. He became a "master arranger," and his {genre : rap}s and braggadocio provided a prototype for modern {genre : hip hop}. But, he is of course most well-known for his Oscar-winning song "{track : Theme from Shaft}," which was dramatic both musically and lyrically.



## 00:11:54 Interview: She & Him

This week's guests are {artist : She & Him}, the "she" being {artist : Zooey Deschanel} and the "him" being {name : Matt Ward}, known to fans as {artist : M. Ward}. The two met during the making of the movie "The Go-Getter" and quickly learned they were successful collaborators. {artist : She & Him}'s first album {album : Volume One}, is a collection of songs written by Zooey, as well as a couple of covers. {name : Zooey [Deschanel]} explains that she's most influenced by classic {genre : pop} songwriting, much of which pre-dates {genre : rock and roll}. You can hear the {genre : country}, {genre : doo-wop} and {tag : Brill-building} influence on the duo's music as they perform their songs "{track : Take It Back}" and "{track : You've Really Got a Hold on Me}" as well as two bonus tracks.

Zooey and Matt's visit to the show prompted Jim and Greg to think about other Hollywood crossover attempts -- both hits and misses. Here are some other {tag : musical actors}:

- {artist : Eddie Murphy}
- {artist : Ricky Nelson}
- {artist : Brandon Cruz}
- {artist : Will Oldham}
- {artist : Scarlett Johansen}
- {artist : William Shatner}

## 00:50:10 Review: Brazilian Girls

![New York City](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/142/2BM0.jpg)

After seeing {artist : Brazilian Girls} wow crowds at {tag : Lollapalooza}, Jim and Greg wanted to review the latest album from the international quartet called {album : New York City}. {host : Jim} compares the group to {artist : Stereolab}, with influences in {era : '60s}Â  {genre : lounge} music, as well as German {genre : krautrock}, but explains they are more danceable. He loves lead singer {name : Sabina Sciubba}'s on-stage and on-record persona which is part {artist : Nico}, part {artist : Jane Birkin} and part {artist : Astrud Gilberto}. He gives the album a {tag : Buy It}. {host : Greg} is less enthused. He finds the album to be pleasant, but less up-tempo than previous efforts. He wishes they had more to say and thinks it's just merely background music. He gives it a {tag : Try It}.
