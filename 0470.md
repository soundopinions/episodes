# Show 470: Protomartyr and Opinions on The Preatures
![proto](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2014/proto_web.jpg)

{place: Detroit} {genre: postpunk} band {artist: Protomartyr} visits the Sound Opinions studio, and {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} review a new album by the {place: Australia}n quintet {artist: The Preatures}.


## 00:02:13 Intro: Music News
{artist: The Turtles} are best known for hits like {era: 1967}'s "{track: Happy Together}." But, vocalists {name: Flo and Eddie}, or {name: Howard Kaylan} and {name: Mark Volman}, are still making news—but more for their legal battles than their music. Last year they sued {tag: SiriusXM} for $100 million, saying that by playing its songs without permission, the broadcaster had infringed on the group's rights under state laws. The first ruling came down in September in {place: California}, in favor of The Turtles. Then, earlier this month, a district court judge in {place: New York} ruled against SiriusXM and rejected its motion for summary judgment. This is being considered a major victory for artists and record companies in the {tag: copyright} debate. But, more significantly, it may have wider impact if the cases lead to changes in copyright law—specifically an obscure provision on recordings made before {era: 1972} when federal copyright protection went into effect. For songs by the Turtles and other "{genre: oldies}" acts, neither SiriusXM nor services like {tag: Pandora} pay labels or artists. They do, however, pay royalties for songwriting. So, it begs the question - who should get credit, financial that is, for a song—the songwriter, the performer, or both? And as {tag: *Wondering Sound*} Lead News Writer {name: Marc Hogan} explains, $60 million/year is at stake according to {tag: royalties} organization {tag: SoundExchange}. So lawmakers better get cracking.

## 00:11:05 Interview: Protomartyr
In the {era: 1990}'s, the musical attitude of {place: Detroit} was reshaped by artists like {artist: Eminem} and {artist: Jack White}. But now the Motor City's mood has changed even more, and the {genre: minimalist} {genre: post-punk} sounds of {artist: Protomartyr} are at the fore. The four-piece made a big impact on {host: Greg} back at this year's {tag: SXSW} in {place: Austin, TX} with an almost contradictory mix of urgency and restraint, courtesy of {tag: guitarist} {name: Greg Ahee}'s stripped down playing and {tag: vocalist} {name: Joe Casey}'s sometimes callous, sometimes cool vocals. The band is rounded out by {tag: bassist} {name: Scott Davidson} and {tag: drummer} {name: Alex Leonard} and Greg welcomes them into the studio for a conversation and performance of songs off their sophomore album, {album: Under Color of Official Right}. In addition to their connection to literary icon {name: Elmore Leonard}, the band also tells Greg about how they went from a somewhat nonchalant beginnings, to constructing a tightly arranged and thoroughly purposeful album guided by the philosophy of doing more with less. 


## 00:49:22 Review: The Preatures
![Blue Planet Eyes](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/470/2AA0.jpg)
While {host: Greg} discovered {artist: Protomartyr} at the 2014 {tag: SXSW} Music Conference, {host: Jim} came back from {place: Austin} raving about {artist: The Preatures}. The {place: Australia}n quintet's new album is called {album: Blue Planet Eyes}, and both Jim and Greg think it's the warm, upbeat salve we need during these blistering months. The album was produced by {artist: Spoon}'s {name: Jim Eno}, and Greg can hear his taut, syncopated touches all over it. And while Preatures singer {name: Isabella Manfredi} is being compared to {genre: New Wave} divas like {name: Blondie} and {name: Chrissie Hynde}, Jim adds another joyful influence: "Walking on Sunshine" by Katrina & the Waves. If you're making your list for Santa, add {album: Blue Planet Eyes}--a double {tag: Buy It}.
