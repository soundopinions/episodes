## Review: Throwing Muses

{artist : Throwing Muses} rose to prominence during the alternative music boom of the nineties. Lead singer Kristin Hersch has shifted focus to her solo work, but in recent years has come back to Muses. On “{album : Moonlight Concessions}” Jim and Greg hear similarities with Nirvana's Unplugged album.



## 00:00:00 Feature: Women in Ska

Hosts Jim and Greg discuss women in the British ska scene with author {tag : Heather Augustyn}. She points out that while the two tone ska scene of the late '70s and '80s was admirably anti-racist, it was not gender balanced at all. She shares five female artists who made great work in that era despite the challenges.
