## 00:01:53 News: 4.1.2011
The {tag: music industry}'s head is in the clouds. {tag: Amazon} just announced its {tag: cloud-based} media server, beating out {tag: Google} and {tag: Apple}. This allows people to listen to their music from any device, anywhere, though for now, the server is {tag: Android}-only. But, as {host: Jim} explains, it's pretty cost-effective for consumers with average size music collections. The real issue is the legality of {tag: Cloud Drive}. Music labels are already bristling that Amazon didn't wait to secure licensing deals before launching – an issue that has been holding up its competitors. Jim and {host: Greg} smell a lawsuit.

## 00:04:47 Special: Bob Dylan

![heylin](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2011/heylin.jpg)

If all that talk about clouds and androids hasn't made you feel old, get this...{artist: Bob Dylan} is turning 70 this May. And we here at {tag: *Sound Opinions*} feel that this birthday boy deserves not one, but three episodes in his honor. This week is the first installment and focuses on Dylan's {tag: early years} as a {genre:  folk}ie and {tag: protest singer} in {place: New York}. Dylan moved to {place: Greenwich Village} in {era: 1961} at age 19. Within just a few years, he had signed to {label: Columbia Records}, teamed up with {tag: manager} {name: Albert Grossman}, released four albums, and become "the voice of a generation." Never one to be pigeonholed, Dylan abandoned categories just as soon as he was assigned them. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} talk to Dylan {tag: expert} {name: Clinton Heylin} about the singer's influences during those years and his growth as a songwriter and performer. Clinton recently explored Dylan's entire song catalog in two companion books, {tag: *Revolution in the Air*} and {tag: *Still on the Road*}. 

Following their conversation, Jim and Greg talk about their favorite {artist: [Bob] Dylan} tracks from 1961-1964. Jim chooses a protest song that has remained timeless, and one that Dylan continues to perform, "{track: Masters of War}." He fell in love with this song, which was released on {album: The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan} in 1963, through the many covers of it. Greg goes with a song that is less well-known, but no less impactful. And it showcases {artist: [Bob] Dylan}'s strengths as a singer...yes that's right, *singer*. "{track: Moonshiner}" is Dylan's take on a traditional folk song, and as Greg explains, features a sound he would return to in later years. A version was released on {album: The Bootleg Series Vol 1-3}.

## 00:45:22 Review: Lykke Li
![Wounded Rhymes (Deluxe Version)](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/03/74/dc/0374dc34-1a60-6550-5b6a-dd1f716a2423/source/600x600bb.jpg "263435943/421468392")
{place: Swedish} {tag: singer} {artist: Lykke Li} has a new album out called {album: Wounded Rhymes}. She has again teamed up with fellow Swede {name: Bjorn Yttling} of {artist: Peter, Bjorn and John}. The maturity is leaps and bounds above her previous effort. {host: Greg} was impressed with the "oomph" of her voice and her interesting source material. It's {name: Phil Spector} and {genre: doo-wop}, but with a wicked tinge. {host: Jim} agrees, adding {genre: gospel} and {genre: soul} influences to that pot. *Wounded Rhymes* gets a double {tag: Buy It} rating.

## 00:50:50 DIJ: Greg
One of {artist: [Bob] Dylan}'s motivations for moving to New York was to meet his hero {artist: Woody Guthrie}. And decades later, Guthrie continues to inspire musicians. In fact, {host: Greg} says one of the best performances of {artist: Wilco}'s entire career is their {tag: cover} of Guthrie's tune "{track: One by One}" from the 1998 album {album: Mermaid Avenue}. And that's saying something, since Greg literally wrote the book on Wilco. As a result, "One by One" goes into the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox} this week.
