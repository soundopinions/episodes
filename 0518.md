## 00:48:34 Review: Protomartyr
![The Agent Intellect](//static.soundopinions.org/assets/518/28Y0.jpg "608692872/1012127888")

{place: Detroit} {genre: post-punk} band and [former Sound Opinions guests](http://soundopinions.org/show/470) {artist: Protomartyr} earned a lot of notice for its second album {album: Under Color of Official Right}. It also placed high on Greg's [Best of 2014](http://soundopinions.org/show/471/) list. Now they've returned with a new record titled {album: The Agent Intellect}. {host: Jim} lauds vocalist {name: Joe Casey}'s ability to write very smart yet moving lyrics, powerfully exploring his mother's battle with {tag: Alzheimer's}. The band's musical approach, which reflects both the bleakness and the pride of contemporary Detroit, places them among the all-time great bands of the {tag: Motor City}. Jim particularly points toward the propulsive yet sleek drumming of {name: Alex Leonard}. {host: Greg} agrees, saying that against expectations, Protomartyr improves with each album. Casey's lyrics fall in the literary tradition of a {name: Nelson Algren} or {name: Charles Bukowski}, but are filled with emotion rather than pretention. The band doesn't waste any notes, instead delivering precise jabs. Greg even goes so far as to call Protomartyr one of the "Great American Bands" who are resurrecting the entire art form. Both critics give *The Agent Intellect* an enthusiastic {tag: Buy It}.
