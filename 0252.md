# Show 252: Sophomore Success & Opinions on Grinderman
After every successful debut comes the dreaded "Sophomore Slump." This week {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} highlight artists that managed to defeat this streak and release a "{tag: Sophomore Success}". Then it's time to review {artist: Grinderman}'s sophomore album, {album: Grinderman 2}.

## 00:01:53 News: 9.24.2010
{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} have talked on the show before about France's "3 Strikes" downloading law before on the show, and they've been wondering when the US will present its own anti-piracy initiative. Well, the Senate just did. {name: Senator Patrick Leahy} of {place: Vermont} introduced the "{tag: Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act}", a bipartisan bill that would allow the D.O.J. to shut down websites with pirated content. Record labels and Hollywood studios have been waiting for this for some time. Jim points out that a similar bill was introduced during the Bush administration, but, perhaps rightly so, some lawmakers didn't feel the government should be footing the bill for these legal actions. With President Obama's appointment of an {tag: Intellectual Property Czar}, Greg sees a trend toward supporting corporate copyright holders in this administration.

In related news, {artist: U2}'s {tag: manager} {name: Paul McGuinness} recently published his own manifesto about the future of the music industry as it relates to downloading. There are few men as powerful in music today, so his words carry a lot of weight, but Jim and Greg aren't sure McGuinness is being very forward thinking. He feels that internet service providers are not doing enough to catch pirates, and that the solution is to bundle royalty costs into your internet fee. U2 is one of the few bands, like Radiohead, who could choose to revolutionize their business model. But, disappointingly, it's business as usual for them.

## 00:08:42 List: Sophomore Success
They say that it takes a lifetime to make your first record and only a few months to make your second. If that's true, then it's no surprise that most artists face the dreaded "sophomore slump."

## 00:47:34 Review: Grinderman
![Grinderman 2 (Deluxe Version)](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/27/df/0f/27df0ffb-31ab-f375-33e7-d5286752f43a/source/600x600bb.jpg "209501657/387298312")
Now it comes time to look at a new sophomore effort: {artist: Grinderman} 2. {name: Nick Cave}'s blues punk side project wowed {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} with its debut. And with this one, they've proved they can do more than just pure, raw energy. Jim hears a lot more experimentation, but also a lot more melody. Greg even found some songs just plain creepy. He calls Cave a wonderful "nasty rock and roll machine." {album: Grinderman 2} gets a double {tag: Buy It}.
