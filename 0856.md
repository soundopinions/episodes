The hosts review the third album from {artist : The Regrettes}, {album : Further Joy}. Led by Lydia Night, the band's previous two albums were more garage rock while this one is more slickly produced pop. While the new sound was initially off-putting, both Jim and Greg see honesty and artistic progression in the album.
