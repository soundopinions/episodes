# Show 217: Doolittle (Classic Album Dissection) & Opinions on Midlake

## 00:01:45 Intro: Music News
{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} start by discussing news that {name: Alan Ellis}, the {tag: administrator} of the popular {place: UK} bit-torrent site {tag: Oink.cd} was {tag: acquitted} of charges of conspiring to defraud copyright owners. Usually Jim and Greg are reporting victory for the music industry, so they were surprised to see this verdict. But, the key was that Ellis could not be linked to any conspiracy; he merely provided the ability to search for content. A judge or jury is not likely to be as lenient to the actual downloaders, like {artist: Trent Reznor}. During its operation Oink facilitated the trading of 21 million music files.

Music fans were hit with lots of sad news last week. First, there was the {tag: death} of {place: Memphis} {genre: punk} rocker {artist: Jay Reatard} at the age of {tag: 29}. Then, there was the death of {label: Wax Trax Records} {tag: founder} {name: Dannie Flesher} at the age of {tag: 58}. And finally, there was the death of {genre: soul} {tag: singer} {artist: Teddy Pendergrass} at the age of {tag: 59}. Pendergrass first got attention as the drummer, then singer in {artist: Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes}. In fact, many people may not know that it was Pendergrass, not Melvin, who sang one of their biggest hits, "{track: If You Don't Know Me By Now}." Pendergrass continued to work with {place: Philadelphia} team {artist: Gamble and Huff} and to become the king of the "slow jam." But, to remember Pendergrass, Jim and Greg decide to play "{track: You Can't Hide From Yourself}," an up-tempo track that shows his diversity as a performer.

## 00:08:58 Classic Album Dissection: Doolittle
![Doolittle](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/217/EY0.jpg)
This week {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} conduct one of their patented {tag: Classic Album Dissections}. They decided to focus on a landmark album in {genre: indie rock}: {album: Doolittle} by {artist: The Pixies}. As an added bonus, they're joined by one of the creators of Doolittle, Pixies {tag: singer} and {tag: songwriter} {name: Charles Thompson} aka {name: Black Francis} aka {name: Frank Black}. Charles and bandmates {name: Kim Deal}, {name: Joey Santiago} and {name: David Lovering} recently marked the album's {tag: 20th anniversary} with a tour dedicated to the record. While artists such as {artist: Kurt Cobain} have cited it as a major {tag: influence}, Doolittle was a slow burn record. After its 1989 release, it didn't achieve gold status until almost a decade later.

As Charles explains to Jim and Greg, his vocal style and lyrics were an amalgamation of his upbringing and the art and ideas floating around him at that time. It's a unique mix of preaching, surrealism and even sexual frustration. But, the songwriter warns against dissecting the lyrics too closely. He loves words for words' sake.

The lead singer also credits {tag: producer} {name: Gil Norton} for the mix of "raw and fancy" that people associate with The Pixies. He polished up their sound, but knew well enough to leave a little roughness around the edges. Another component of the sweet but scary mix is Joey Santiago's guitar playing. Charles describes it as just like the guitarist's own personality-sweet and gentle like a little kid, but capable of smashing something to bits.

At the end of their discussion Jim and Greg ask Charles/Black/Frank to choose a favorite track from Doolittle. He goes with "{track: Monkey Gone to Heaven}," a song that encapsulates all of the album's elements-humor, darkness, violence, love, hope and references to the nautical and the mythological. Finally, Charles sees it as a great example of the yin and yang connection between him and singer Kim Deal.

## 00:47:19 Review: Midlake
![The Courage of Others (Deluxe)](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/217/26V0.jpg)
At the end of the show {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} review {album: The Courage of Others}, the third album from {place: Denton, Texas} rockers {artist: Midlake}. When the band appeared on {tag: Sound Opinions} in 2007, many people were comparing their album {album: The Trials of Van Occupanther} and its track "{track: Roscoe}" to '70s Fleetwood Mac. Now, Jim hears more of an early '60s English folk vibe. It's a gorgeous but chilling record that's perfect for winter. Jim gives it a {tag: Buy It}. Greg agrees, adding that he hears some Elizabethan madrigals' influence as well. He hesitates to call Midlake and bands like Fleet Foxes and Animal Collective "hippies," but hears their yearning for a return to nature. Greg also gives Midlake a Buy It.
