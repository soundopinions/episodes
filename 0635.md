{artist : Merrill Garbus} is back with her fourth full-length {artist : tUnE-yArDs} project, titled {album : I Can Feel You Creep Into My Private Life}. Jim says that immediately before writing this album, Garbus was on a six-month meditation workshop to see what she could do "as a white person in the realm of social justice. That sounds like heady and heavy stuff…It's not though. This is a {genre : dance} album, heavily influenced by {era : '70s}  {genre : disco}, and I think the classic sounds of Chicago {genre : house}."

Greg adds that the album "could easily be ponderous, but she's paring cultural appropriation, the end of the world… these are heavy subjects… with this incredibly liberating music, this body music." Standout tracks include "{track : Heart Attack}", "{track : Colonizer}" and "{track : Home}". {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} give it a double {tag : Buy It}.

While Mensa is a protégé of rap legend {artist : Jay-Z}, he has his own unique style and swagger: he loves {tag : skateboarding}, is gregarious and has a pretty stellar singing voice. His debut studio album, {album : The Autobiography}, is an ambitious record chronicling the entirety of his 24 years of life, and it's full of hard hitting beats and impactful (and sometimes hilarious) lyrics. {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} talk to Vic Mensa about overcoming drugs, his love for {genre : rock} music and how he made a record that plays like a book.

South African {genre : jazz} trumpeter {artist : Hugh Masekela} died on January 23rd at the age of 78 after a long battle with cancer. A musician not afraid to express his {tag : political} views, he spent many years in exile during the height of apartheid in his homeland. He is best known for his biggest hit, 1968's "{track : Grazing in the Grass}," as well as for a long list of {tag : protest songs}. Greg thinks those protest songs, like "{track : Bring Him Back Home (Nelson Mandela)}" are Masekela's most poignant. He adds, "The fact that he was able to go back to {place : South Africa}, and live there… To see the revolution and the protest he advocated for in his songs, finally come to fruition in the end of {tag : apartheid}… I think was a particularly powerful statement for his music."



## 00:48:15 Feature: Obit: Dolores O'Riordan



{host : Jim} pays tribute to the late {artist : Dolores O'Riordan} of the {era : '90s} Irish {genre : rock} band {artist : The Cranberries}.
