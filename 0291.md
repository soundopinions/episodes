## 00:01:53 News: 06.24.2011
{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} talk about two news stories merging {tag: Broadway} and the {genre: pop} world. The {tag: Tony} award-winning musical {tag: *Book of Mormon*} is now also a chart success. It's the highest-charting Broadway cast album and first in the top ten since 1969, when {album: Hair} spent thirteen straight weeks at #1. On the other end of the spectrum, {tag: YouTube} phenom {artist: Susan Boyle} has inspired a new musical called *{track: I Dreamed a Dream}*. It will be a fairy tale of sorts, where the heroine gets swept away to {tag: Hollywood} (and the big bad wolf is {name: Simon Cowell}).

This past weekend {artist: Bruce Springsteen} lost his constant sidekick and friend, {artist: Clarence Clemons}. Greg calls Clemons the first among equals in a large band of characters. His {tag: saxophone} was as important to many of Springsteen's songs as the Boss's guitar. And even in later years, when sax wasn't as prominent a component, Clemons was a large presence onstage. Jim will miss that energy, though he has always been critical of his sax style. To remember Clarence Clemons our hosts listen to "{track: Jungleland}" from the 1975 album {album: Born to Run}.

## 00:08:24 Interview: Barry Mann & Cynthia Weil
It's always interesting to get the backstory behind our favorite music and hear from producers, songwriters and session musicians. So this week {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} talk to songwriting duo {artist: Barry Mann} & {artist: Cynthia Weil}. The {tag: husband and wife team} made their mark during the {era: Brill Building} era of the {era: 1960s } alongside other hired guns like {artist: Carole King} & {artist: Gerry Goffin} and {artist: Jerry Leiber} & {artist: Mike Stoller}. Barry and Cynthia talk about the friendly competition between {tag: songwriters} during that time and how they came up with classic pop tunes like "{track: You've Lost That Loving Feeling}," "{track: On Broadway}," and "{track: Kicks}." They also wrote "{track: We Gotta Get Out of This Place}," but as a single for Barry...not {artist: The Animals}. Barry and Cynthia recently received the {tag: Johnny Mercer Award} presented by {place: The Songwriters' Hall of Fame}. And Cynthia has got something for the younger set as well: check out her children's book {tag: *Rockin' Babies*}. 

## 00:43:10 Review: Bon Iver
![Bon Iver (Deluxe Edition)](http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/16670/homepage_large.d44901b5.jpg "273428126/479582402")

There's been a whole lotta commentary about the new album by {artist: Bon Iver}â€“some good, some bad. {name: Justin Vernon} first made a splash in 2008 with {album: For Emma, Forever Ago}. Even {artist: Kanye West} is a {tag: fan}. But the mythology precedes the record according to {host: Greg}. {album: Bon Iver, Bon Iver} is much more lushly orchestrated, but it really starts to sag in the middle. By the last track Greg was having bad visions of {artist: Steve Winwood} and {artist: Bruce Hornsby}. He says {tag: Burn It}. {host: Jim} hears {artist: Mike + The Mechanics} and thinks Greg is being kind. The production is grating, the lyrics nonsensical and the vibe drippy and snoozy. In other words: {tag: Trash It}.

## 00:49:27 DIJ: Greg
To cap off the show, {host: Greg} pays tribute to {artist: Robert Johnson}. The {tag: 100th anniversary} of the {genre: blues}man's {tag: death} is this year. Although he died at the age of 27 and didn't get to record much in his lifetime, he nonetheless became so influential many regard him as the godfather of {genre: rock and roll}. With his unique vocal and {tag: guitar} performances and complicated narratives, it's easy to understand why Johnson resonates today. Greg chooses to add the song "{track: If I Had Possession Over Judgement Day}" to the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}.
