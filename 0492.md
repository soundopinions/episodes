# Show 492: Songs About Mom for Mother's Day

![Mom](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2015/mothersday_web.jpg)

{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} celebrate {tag: Mother's Day} with their favorite **Songs About Mom**. And what happens when bands become {tag: brand}s?
 
## 00:02:10 Intro: Music News

The big {tag: summer concert season} is getting underway, and many fans have their sights set on big ticket tours to see their favorite {genre: classic rock}ers. But, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} wonder if they are really getting the full band experience?  {artist: The Who}, for example, just kicked off their {era: 2015} tour and are likely to rake in the bucks despite being at half capacity. Drummer {name: Keith Moon} and bassist {name: John Entwistle} have passed away, so the answer to "Who are The Who?"  is merely {name: Roger Daltrey} and {name: Pete Townshend}. That duo brought in $13 million during their 2012-13 tour, far more than Pete or Roger could do solo. So, for incomplete acts like The Who, {artist: AC/DC}, {artist: Smashing Pumpkins} and {artist: Queen}, Jim and Greg suspect the {tag: brand} is more important than the band.
