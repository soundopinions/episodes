# Show 417: Remembering Lou Reed & Opinions on M.I.A.

![Lou Reed](http://static.soundopinions.org/images/2013/loureed.jpg)

Jim and Greg remember Lou Reed and five of his most important releases. Plus, M.I.A. makes a lot of headlines, and now she's made a new album. They review Matangi.

## 00:01:49 News: 11.22.13
{artist: Madonna} is the world's [highest-paid](http://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2013/11/19/the-worlds-highest-paid-musicians-2013/) musician according to {tag: *Forbes*}. (Insert {track: "Material Girl"} joke here.) But, more surprising is how well some artists have done without even releasing music. {artist: Toby Keith} can thank his record label, restaurant chain and mescal line for some of his $65 million. And {artist: Diddy} can thank {tag: Ciroc} for his $50 mil.

## 00:03:27 Special: Remembering Lou Reed
Rock legend, {tag: poet} and {artist: Velvet Underground} founder {name: Lou Reed} died on October 27 at age 71. That week {host: Jim} honored him with the addition of the {artist: Velvet Underground} track{track:  "Candy Says"} to the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}. But, this influential singer, songwriter and guitarist deserves more than just a few minutes of our time. He helped shape 50 years of rock music, perhaps more than any single figure, according to our hosts. And so they wanted to explore why news of his death made such waves and why fans are still mourning. The best way to do this, of course, is through the music, and these five albums in particular: 

### Essential Lou Reed albums

- {artist: The Velvet Underground}, {album: White Light/White Heat} ({era: 1968})
- {artist: The Velvet Underground}, {album: Loaded} ({era: 1970})
- {artist: Lou Reed}, {album: Berlin} ({era: 1973})
- {artist: Lou Reed}, {album: The Blue Mask} ({era: 1982})

## 00:49:37 Review: M.I.A.
![Matangi](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music4/v4/67/fe/38/67fe38ea-239c-9754-e298-1643891a3cb0/UMG_cvrart_00602537569014_01_RGB72_1500x1500_13UAEIM09178.jpg/600x600bb-85.jpg "14677454/728776031")

 After three years of garnering more attention for her public antics than her music, {genre: agit-rap}per {artist: M.I.A.} is back with her fourth studio genre, {album: Matangi}. Both {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} think the effort is a refreshing return to form after her lukewarm 2010 release, {album: Maya}. However, Greg isn't much impressed by Matangi's tonal turn away from the political and more towards the spiritual, which he thinks at times comes off as kind of superficial. Jim agrees that M.I.A. doesn't have as much to say this time out, but the music—a blend of western pop melodies and {genre: eastern dance} rhythms—is still unmatched. Both critics give Matangi a {tag: Burn It}.
