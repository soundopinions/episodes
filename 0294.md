## 00:01:52 News: 7.15.2011
The {tag: music industry} now has a powerful new ally in its long-running fight against illegal {tag: file sharing}: your friendly neighborhood internet service provider. After years of on-and-off negotiation with the {tag: RIAA} and {tag: MPAA}, the major {place: U.S.} {tag: ISPs} – {tag: AT&T}, {tag: Verizon}, {tag: Cablevision}, {tag: Comcast}, {tag: Time Warner} – have voluntarily agreed to "police" users they suspect of downloading illegal material (or as the ISPs are spinning it, "educate" them). Illegal downloaders will receive a series of warnings before their internet connections are slowed to a crawl. {artist: U2} {tag: manager} {name: Paul McGuinness}, an early advocate of ISPs taking on greater responsibility for online piracy, applauded the move. But Greg is wary. Now that ISPs have taken up the anti-piracy banner, will the U.S. government be next?

The {tag: music industry} has yet another reason to celebrate. For the first time since 2004, {tag: music sales} are up. (And sure, only by 1%, but still!) While sales by superstar acts like {artist: Adele} and {artist: Eminem} did their part, the real surprise was the spike in catalog sales. Seems people just can't seem to get enough of that {artist: Credence Clearwater Revival}.

## 00:04:54  Interview: tUnE-yArDs
{artist: tUnE-yArDs}'s second album {album: w h o k i l l} made it onto both {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}'s lists of the {tag: Best Albums of 2011 (so far)}. This week, Jim and Greg are in the studio with the creative force behind the band, {place: New England} native {name: Merrill Garbus}. Garbus has come a long way since her days as a professional {tag: puppeteer}, when she performed for modest crowds with the indie act {artist: Sister Suvi} and lived with her parents. This month the {place: Oakland}-based musician will be one of the most anticipated acts at the {tag: Pitchfork Music Festival}. Like one of her early influences, {artist: Paul Simon}, Garbus incorporates plenty of {tag: African polyrhythms} and {tag: vocal textures} into her music, and she doesn't shy away from discussions about cultural appropriation. She also takes huge risks as a live performer, looping her voice, drums, and ukulele onstage to become a veritable one-woman band. She performs the feat live in the studio, taking Jim and Greg through the beginning of "{track: Powa}." With the backing of {tag: bassist} {name: Nate Brenner} and a hefty horn section, she also performs "{track: Doorstep}" and the band's breakout song "{track: Bizness}." 

## 00:49:23 DIJ: Jim
{host: Jim} riffs on tUnE-yArDs' love for {place: Africa}n rhythms for his {tag: Desert Island Jukebox} pick. It reminds us of yet another Western band to put African beats to its own creative use. This week, it's the {place: British} new wave group {artist: Bow Wow Wow}. {name: Malcolm McLaren} and {name: Vivienne Westwood} created the band in 1980, but were out a lead singer until they discovered 14-year-old {name: Annabella Lwin} working at a dry cleaner and singing along to {artist: Stevie Wonder}. Jim's pick, "{track: C·30 C·60 C·90 Go}" makes ample use of the then-popular "{place: Burundi} Beat," a rhythm cribbed from a French anthropologist's recording of native Burundian percussionists. Tracked down years later, the original Burundian musicians singled out Bow Wow Wow for special props. Sure, they stole the beat, but they also gave it a new spin.
