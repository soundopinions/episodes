{name: Grant Hart}, drummer and singer for the influential {place: Minneapolis}-based {genre: rock} band {artist: Hüsker Dü}, is dead at age 56. Hart died the evening of September 13 from liver cancer. While many associate the band Hüsker Dü with Bob Mould, in many ways it was just as much Hart's band as Mould's. Hart wrote songs like "{track: Pink Turns to Blue}," "{track: Green Eyes}," "{track: Diane}" and more. After the band broke up in 1987, Hart embarked on a solo career and founded a new group, {artist: Nova Mob}. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} pay tribute to the late Hart by playing "{track: The Girl Who Lives on Heaven Hill}," a song he wrote and sang from Hüsker Dü's third album {album: New Day Rising}.
