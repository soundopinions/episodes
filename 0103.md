## 00:01:50 Review: Alicia Keys

![As I Am](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/103/320.jpg)

{artist : Alicia Keys} has a record out this week that's poised to be #1. Keys has been groomed by {name : Clive Davis} in the old school star-making machine, and has become one of the biggest recording artists of this decade. Jim has never been overly impressed by Keys' style which is part polished {genre : R&B}, part gritty {genre : hip hop}. But, {album : As I Am} is so campy and over the top, that he found himself enjoying the record...even the {artist : John Mayer} duet. Like a bag of candy, {host : Jim} knows it's not good for him, but he gives the record a {tag : Buy It}. {host : Greg} wants to like Keys a lot more; she's obviously got real talent. But, he thinks her lyrics are nothing but a string of clichés. He also wishes she wasn't so bogged down by the over-production. He gives {album : As I Am} a {tag : Trash It}.



## 00:12:02 List: Turkey Shoot 2007

## 00:42:04 Review: The Hives

![The Black and White Album](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/103/1Y40.jpg)

The second album up for review this week is {album : The Black and White Album} by Swedish rockers {artist : The Hives}. The band had a hit in 2000 with "{track : Hate to Say I Told You So}," but have yet to really break through to mainstream audiences (despite obvious attempts by their record company). This album is a change of pace for the {genre : garage rock}ers and has more soul than listeners heard previously. They even teamed up with {genre : hip hop} producer {name : Pharrell Williams} for a couple of tracks. The result works for {host : Greg}, though he wishes they'd edited down the number of tracks. {host : Jim} agrees that the merging of sounds is really successful. They have a credible groove. Both Jim and Greg give {album : The Black and White Album} a {tag : Buy It}.
