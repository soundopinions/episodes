## 00:01:41 Review: Leonard Cohen
![leonard](https://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2019/dance.jpg)
Although {artist: Leonard Cohen} died in 2016, his 15th album, {album: Thanks for the Dance}, just came out. Produced with his son Adam, this record continues Cohen's legacy as a gravelly voiced, poetic artist. {host: Jim} is impressed by the album and enjoys the minimalist instrumentation and production on it, especially since he notes many of his past works were too {era: '80s} {genre: synth} heavy. He also likes that Cohen continued to weave seductive adventure tales like "{track: The Night of Santiago}." {host: Greg} feels differently. He preferred Cohen's last three records to this one, citing he felt it sounded unfinished and that his lyrics weren't particularly fresh or inventive. He doesn't think it's a terrible album, but it doesn't measure up to the high standard he has for Cohen's music.


## 00:07:41 Review: Sudan Archives

{artist: Sudan Archives} wowed both {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} at {tag: SXSW} a few years back, and her debut album, {album: Athena}, did not disappoint. Jim calls her sound "really sophisticated {genre: R&B}... based on her songs, her voice and that violin." She is also inspired by the fiddle-based {genre: folk} music of {place: Sudan}, which shows in her self-taught {tag: violin} stylings. Greg notes that she uses the instrument as a "sound machine," using the violin in a variety of ways to add texture to the tracks. He adds that he loves that Sudan Archives is "mixing the {genre: pop} with the {genre: experimental} feel, the {tag: exoticism} with the more {genre: experimental}." Jim concludes that Athena is a "stunning debut."

Beyond his influence as a {era: Beat Generation} writer, {artist: William S. Burroughs} had an outsized influence over decades of musicians from {artist: Mick Jagger} to {artist: Al Jourgenson}, {artist: Paul McCartney} to {artist: Patti Smith}, and {artist: Throbbing Gristle} to {artist: Kurt Cobain}. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} talk with music journalist {name: Casey Rae} about his new book, _{tag: William S. Burroughs and the Cult of Rock 'n' Roll}_. In it he makes the case that Burroughs' influence on music was deeper and more profound than his Beat contemporaries {artist: Allen Ginsberg} and {artist: Jack Kerouac}.
