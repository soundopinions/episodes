## 00:43:08 Interview: Alex Ross 

![Music as Violence](https://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2016/music%20as%20violence.jpg)

{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} spend most of their time on Sound Opinions talking about music they love. Music they connect with, music that tells a relatable story, music that stirs an emotional reaction. But {name: Alex Ross} from {tag: the New Yorker} magazine came on the show to talk about a different reaction to music, music as a weapon. His recent article When Music is Violence explores the use of music to sinister ends. Alex talks with Jim and Greg about the history of music as a weapon, from the use by the Nazis, to attempts to overthrow Panamanian dictator {name: Manuel Noriega} with {artist: Led Zeppelin}, to how {genre: classical} music keeps kids from loitering in 7-11 parking lots. Alex says that ultimately music is not a sacred space, and the "music we love the most...can be deployed in some horrifying way."
