![Road Trip](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2017/roadtrip_web.jpg)

Summer is upon us so that means one thing: road trip! {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} take a virtual cross-country drive playing their favorite songs about American cities, states, and regions from coast-to-coast. Plus, they review the posthumous album from {genre: rock 'n' roll} legend {artist: Chuck Berry}.

## 00:01:45 List: Musical Road Trip

It's summer time, which means for many of us that road trips are on the horizon. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} highlight some of their favorite songs about American cities, states, and regions, from Boston and New York in the east, all the way to California in the west. Of course, they also stop by the Great Plains and the south on the way.

- {artist: Glen Campbell}, "{track: Wichita Lineman}"
- {artist: Frank Zappa and The Mothers of Invention}, "{track: Montana}"
- {artist: Phantom Planet}, "{track: California}"

## 00:44:06 Review: Chuck Berry
![Chuck](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/1e/fd/e3/1efde396-4ae3-4b2a-7a38-4dd11d87252a/source/600x600bb.jpg "343170/1210063459")

When {artist: Chuck Berry}, one of the architects of {genre: rock 'n' roll}, [died in March](http://soundopinions.org/show/591/), he had completed work on what would be his final album. {album: Chuck}, his first record since 1979, has finally been released. {host: Jim} warns that critics need to evaluate posthumous albums on their own terms when they come from beloved artists. In the case of {album: Chuck}, Jim says, the record features some of the worst songs in Berry's history â€“ from the {genre: Caribbean} pastiche of "{track: Jamaica Moon}" to the {genre: talking blues} of "{track: Dutchman}" and "{track: Eyes of Man}." Berry's lyrics, voice, and guitar playing are not what they were in his prime. {host: Greg} is charmed that Berry is including family members and talking about his family for the first time on record. He's also intrigued by the insight into Berry's odd personality that comes though. But he agrees that it's not much of a musical accomplishment. {album: Chuck}, sadly, gets a double-{tag: Trash It}.

## 00:51:14 DIJ: Jim
{host: Jim} gets a little edgy when summer begins and things get hot. So this week, he nominates one of the nastiest songs in the history of rock to the Desert Island Jukebox: "{track: Orphans}" by {artist: Teenage Jesus and the Jerks}. Fronted by the great {name: Lydia Lunch}, the band was part of the "{genre: no wave}" movement that tossed out the chords and melodicism of earlier {genre: punk} rockers in favor of pure noise. Teenage Jesus was one of the bands featured in the definitive no wave compilation, 1978's {album: No New York}, produced by {name: Brian Eno}. "Orphans" features only three lines of lyrics, furious guitar playing, and pounding drums. For Jim, it's the antithesis of a summer song.
