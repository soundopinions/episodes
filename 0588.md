![Gene Chandler](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2017/genechandler_web.JPG)

From 1962 to 1970, {place : Chicago}  {genre : soul} singer {artist : Gene Chandler} recorded nineteen top forty hits, but he'll forever be known as the "{track : Duke of Earl}." As a young artist, he performed across the country, including the Jim Crow South, later transitioning from performer to award-winning producer. Gene Chandler joins {host : Greg} and {host : Jim} for a conversation. Plus, Jim and Greg review the new album by {place : New Jersey} rock band {artist : The Feelies}.



## 00:02:03 Interview: Gene Chandler

Hosts Jim and Greg interview {place : Chicago}  {genre : Soul} singer {artist : Gene Chandler}, who is best known as the "Duke of Earl." {host : Jim} thinks 1961's "Duke of Earl" is one of the best pop or rock songs of that era. Gene Chandler came out of a tradition of Doo Wop in Chicago that included groups like {artist : the Flamingos} and {artist : the Spaniels}. He worked closely with fellow {genre : Chicago Soul} legends {artist : Curtis Mayfield} and {artist : Jerry Butler}. Later in his career, he transitioned into producing other artists, even running his own label, "Mister Chand." The epitome of a "soul survivor," Gene scored hits during the {era : Doo-Wop}, Soul, and {genre : Disco} eras.



## 00:44:38 Review: The Feelies

The {place : New Jersey}  {genre : rock} band {artist : The Feelies} has just released their sixth album in four decades called {album : In Between}. The group is noted for its cohesion and consistency over its long tenure. {host : Greg} thoroughly enjoys this record, and admires The Feelies' skill in combining elements of rock with zen and existential messaging ("make a plan, let it be.") He also appreciates the band's ability to perform as one voice, which speaks to how close these guys are. Greg gives it a {tag : Buy It}. {host : Jim} couldn't agree more, and he expresses his deep admiration and love for The Feelies. He finds this record to be well worth the wait, and praises the group for their combination of the best sounds of {artist : The Velvet Underground} and {artist : Brian Eno} (ding!) Without hesitation, Jim gives In Between an enthusiastic {tag : Buy It}.



## 00:51:10 DIJ: Greg

After a number of deaths of high-profile drummers in recent weeks, {host : Greg} now pays tribute to {name : Butch Trucks}, [who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on January 24](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/arts/music/butch-trucks-dead-allman-brothers-drummer.html). A founding member of [{artist : the Allman Brothers Band}](/show/435/), Trucks remained in the group for its entire 45-year span. He formed one of the best rhythm sections in rock alongside fellow drummer {name : Jai Johanny "Jaimoe" Johanson}. While Jaimoe provided the jazzy accents, Trucks was the freight train, with a command of the {genre : blues} vocabulary. According to Greg, the best example of Trucks's blues shuffle is on a 1971 live recording of "{track : Statesboro Blues}," so it gets its slot in the {tag : Desert Island Jukebox}.
