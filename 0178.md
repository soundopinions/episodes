## 00:01:45 News: 04.24.09
One of the biggest court decisions regarding file-sharing and piracy came down this week. The organizers of the site {tag: Pirate Bay} were sentenced by a Swedish court to pay $3.6 million dollars and spend a year in prison. The defendants claim they merely provide a menu of available media, including music files, movies and software. But a judge and jury has deemed them pirates. Pirate Bay is fighting back, but meanwhile {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} point out that hindering {tag: file-sharing} might actually hinder sales. A new study out of {place: Norway} says that people who illegally share music via P2P networks are overwhelmingly more likely to purchase music. Rather than stealing, the record companies might want to look at this kind of consumption as sampling.

One place you can sample free music is {tag: MySpace}.com. The social networking site has quickly become the go-to place to promote your band and discover new music. That said, it's yet to make any serious cash. The newly revamped MySpace Music site is attempting to do just that with the addition of tour and release information, as well as links to purchase music. If MySpace stays on this path, it will essentially be like a 360 record label a la {tag: Live Nation}.

## 00:08:49 Interview: Jill Sobule
This week's guest is {artist: Jill Sobule}. Jill first got attention with her 1995 hit "{track: I Kissed A Girl}" (not to be mistaken with the current [hit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAp9BKosZXs).) So after years of maneuvering through a crumbling music label system, she decided to try something new. Last year she solicited donations from fans directly and raised $75,000. Now she's back with her fan-funded album, {album: California Years}. Jill performs songs from the new album, and is also joined by friend and performing partner {name: Julia Sweeney}.

## 00:41:47 Review: The Handsome Family
![Honey Moon](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/f5/4f/d7/f54fd7d1-c95f-ea5a-0eee-b06dd35304fb/source/600x600bb.jpg "4671022/346897989")

{artist: The Handsome Family} has a new album out this week called {album: Honey Moon}. Like the title, many of the songs on the album relate nature to love. Love songs are a dime a dozen, but both Jim and Greg are hugely impressed with what the husband and wife duo of {name: Brett [Sparks]} and {name: Rennie Sparks} do with the topic. Brett has mastered their home studio, bringing their {genre: alt-country} sound to a more {genre: pop} one. And, according to our hosts, Rennie is one of the greatest songwriters working in {genre: rock} today. Both {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} give {album: Honey Moon} a {tag: Buy It}, and Jim also encourages listeners to go back to the duo's 1998 masterpiece {album: Through the Trees}. 

## 00:49:18 Review: Booker T. Jones
![Potato Hole](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/0c/6e/7f/0c6e7f6a-ff56-ee23-9cbe-6fb7e7d02611/source/600x600bb.jpg "75510602/308849317")

Multi-instrumentalist {artist: Booker T. Jones} also has a new album out called {album: Potato Hole}. It's a rare solo release from the man behind much of the {label: Stax Records} sound. This time around he's joined up with {artist: Neil Young} and the {artist: Drive-By Truckers} for a more guitar-centric record. That was problematic for {host: Jim}, who wished there was more of a focal point. He gives {album: Potato Hole} a {tag: Try It}. {host: Greg} was impressed when he heard about the project's esteemed line-up. But, for him it didn't translate to the music. Greg didn't hear anything persuasive and thinks {name: Booker T. [Jones] } should stick to {genre: soul}. He gives the album a {tag: Trash It}.
