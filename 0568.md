![Beach Slang](https://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2016/BeachSlang-2_web.jpg)

{artist: Beach Slang} has wowed critics and audiences alike with its loud, energy filled live performances and unabashedly earnest lyrics. But in front of a live audience at the {place: Goose Island Tap Room}, Beach Slang songwriter {name: James Alex} strips away the volume, but not the heart, for an intimate acoustic performance and conversation with {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}. Plus, the new record by {genre: Southern rock}ers {artist: Drive-By Truckers}, and the story behind a forgotten garage classic.

## 00:01:46 Interview: Beach Slang
{artist: Beach Slang}'s music is at home in a loud, crowded, sweaty club with an energetic crowd singing along to every word. But at their core the songs are sincere, emotional and from the heart. So it makes sense that the writing process starts with just singer and guitarist {name: James Alex} and an acoustic guitar. If the songs can hold up in that form, he says, then he "makes it loud and they become Beach Slang." James treated {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}, and a crowd of fans at the {place: Goose Island Tap Room} in {place: Chicago} to a special acoustic performance featuring songs from Beach Slang's new album {album: A Loud Bash Of Teenage Feelings}. James talks about starting a band while raising a family, his songwriting process and his on-going pursuit of happiness in a world full of muck. 

## 00:41:17 Review: Drive-By Truckers
![American Band](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music18/v4/9f/5e/48/9f5e4869-3825-cb3c-90d0-259ed66441d9/source/600x600bb.jpg "330823/1122865113")
The {place: Georgia} {genre: rock} band {artist: Drive-By Truckers} are back with their 11th studio album, {album: American Band}. While the {genre: southern rock} group has been playing together for around 20 years, their latest record is very much in the now, discussing hot button issues like immigration, race relations and gun control. Jim loves this record and he respects the band for still thrilling listeners all these years later. {host: Jim} thinks that this album interprets the important issues of today in a way that measures up to what {artist: Neil Young and Crazy Horse} did at the height of their powers. He gives *American Band* an enthusiastic {tag: Buy It}. Greg agrees, and feels the album has a great balance between the band's signature guitar-based anthem rock and introspective, moodier tracks. He likes the record's social consciousness, and thinks it's just damn good music to boot. {host: Greg} gives it a {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:48:16 Interview: Jack Wood
A few weeks ago, {host: Greg} selected a song for the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox} called {track: Born to Wander} from a songwriter named {artist: Jack Wood}. Recorded in 1966 in small town {place: Michigan}, the song was pressed on just 100 records and largely forgotten. That is until the song appeared in a worldwide TV ad campaign and was repressed by {name: Jack White}'s {label: Third Man Records}. While Greg was able to research the song, less was know about Jack Wood. But Jack himself heard Greg's pick on the show, and he called our Hot Line. {host: Jim} and Greg talk with Jack Wood about writing a song that reached the height of popularity 50 years after it was recorded!
