For Sound Opinions' 700th episode, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} are taking the show to {tag: outer space}! They'll share some of their favorite {tag: songs about space} in honor of the 50th anniversary of the {tag: Apollo 11} {tag: moon landing}. Plus, Jim and Greg review {album: Cuz I Love You}, the latest from {genre: hip hop} and {genre: R&B} artist {artist: Lizzo}, and {genre: pop/soul} {genre: singer-songwriter} {artist: Emily King} talks about the song that got her {tag: Hooked on Sonics}.

## 00:01:58  Review: Lizzo
![Lizzo](https://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2019/Lizzo.png)
{artist: Lizzo} has arrived, releasing her first full length album for {genre: Atlantic Records}, {album: Cuz I Love You}. The {genre: R&B} singer and {genre: rap}per puts her talents on full display and uses the perks of being on a major label to create a genre-blending record. It's no secret that {host: Jim} loves Lizzo, and he's pleased with this album. He enjoys Lizzo's body-positive message, impactful lyrics and colorful personality. He believes she used the major label system to churn out a great {genre: pop} record that is authentically her. {host: Greg} is also a fan, but worries about producers trying to pigeonhole her into a generic pop star role. He loves when the quirky details unique to Lizzo shine through, like her expert flute-playing and vocal inflections. Jim won't stand for any criticism of Lizzo, so they agree to disagree.

## 00:09:57 List: Songs About Space

## 00:44:37 Feature: Hooked On Sonics: Emily King
![Emily King](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sound-images/images/2019/emily%20king.jpg) 
Both {host: Greg} and {host: Jim} applauded {artist: Emily King}'s latest album, {album: Scenery}, which moves deftly between {genre: pop}, {genre: soul}, {genre: funk}, {genre: gospel} and even a bit of {genre: rock}. For our occasional series {tag: Hooked On Sonics}, Emily tells us about the seemingly disparate threads that helped to shape her music, and the song that got her Hooked on Sonics: "{track: Castles Made of Sand}" by {artist: Jimi Hendrix}.

## 00:49:12 DIJ: Jim
Most weeks, either {host: Jim} or {host: Greg} take a trip to the {tag: desert island} and play a song they can't live without. This week, Jim selected "{track: Mother Russia}" by {artist: Renaissance}, a {genre: classical}-influenced {genre: British prog rock} group. Jim thinks that the group doesn't get the respect it deserves. He goes on to add that he's "surpised that bands like {artist: The Decemberists} or {artist: Arcade Fire} don't mention Renaissance more as one of the {genre: orchestral-pop} rediscoveries" because he "hears a lot of the roots of what {genre: orc-pop} has been doing in the last decade in what Renaissance was doing in {era: 1974}."
