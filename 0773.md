Jim and Greg also review the latest from Detroit rock band {artist : Protomartyr}.

The progressive-rock legends' eighth album, {album : Going for the One} might not be the first choice for the casual {artist : Yes} fan (who might prefer {album : Fragile} or {album : Close to the Edge}), but it's a choice many diehard fans would make to dissect, a bit of a sleeper in the catalog, and the band's last beginning-to-end masterpiece.

Released in 1977, it finds the virtuoso superstars drawing on the energy of the then-current punk movement and truly rocking out — though that's not exactly how singer Jon Anderson sees it, and he shares his thoughts on the making of the record in Switzerland.
