# Show 511: Back to School
![back to school](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2015/backtoschool_web.jpg)

Time to sharpen those #2 pencils. With classes back in session, it's time for Jim and Greg to present some more of their favorite Back-To-School songs. Plus, we remember the late, great neurologist and writer Oliver Sacks.


## 00:01:45 Interview: Dr. Oliver Sacks
As critics, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} have always suspected that music affects the brain, but they needed an expert to confirm their hypothesis. This week, we're re-broadcasting their interview with the late {name: Dr. Oliver Sacks}, author of the book *Awakenings*, which later went on to become a film starring Robin Williams. His 2007 book {tag: *Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain*} is a collection of anecdotes illustrating the powerful effects music can have on the brain. Sacks relays his clinical experiences working with a range of patients including individuals who struggle to connect with music's melody, Parkinsonian patients who depend on music's rhythm, and {tag: Alzheimer's} patients who find comfort in music's emotion. These people use music as a lifeline and a way to connect to the world-something rock fans certainly understand.
