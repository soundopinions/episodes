# Show 396: The Sound Opinions World Tour in Mexico 
Rock journalists {name: Josh Norek} and {name: Alejandro Franco} are our guides to music south of the border as the {tag: Sound Opinions World Tour} heads to {place: Mexico}.

![main image](http://static.soundopinions.org/images/2013/mexico.jpg)

## 00:01:48 News: 6.28.2013
{artist: Bobby "Blue" Bland} died this week at age 83. The "Sinatra of the Blues" started out as a gospel singer and was also a valet and chauffeur to {name: B.B. King}. Like the blue-eyed crooner, he used the mic as an instrument and was known for his subtle and instrument approach. You can [hear](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C64LDp4ZGAg) this on the his version of "{track: St. James Infirmary}."

## 00:07:39 World Tour: Mexico
Fresh from stops in {place: Japan} and{place:  Sweden}, the {tag: Sound Opinions World Tour} continues south of the border. Public radio's "{tag: The Latin Alternative}" co-host {name: Josh Norek} is our guide to {place: Mexico}'s music scene. As Vice President of the Latin alternative music label {label: Nacional Records}, Norek's had a chance to work with many of Mexico's pioneering rock acts, from {name: Saul Hernandez}'s {artist: Jaguares}, to pop-rock arena act {artist: Mana}. He's seen the audience for Mexican music in the U.S. grow (as second and third generation Mexican-Americans get in touch with their musical roots), and he's seen it get more experimental. Norek argues that Mexico's musical renaissance really kicked into gear with {artist: Café Tacvba} in the nineties. Tacvba fused genres like {genre: ska}, {genre: metal}, and {genre: punk} with traditional Mexican regional music. Cafe Tacvba sounded Mexican and were proud of it. More recently, DJ outfits like {artist: Nortec Collective} and {artist: Mexican Institute of Sound} have adapted the same approach to techno, merging beats and norte~no samples, for example. Norek says Mexico's music scene continues to develop in spite of formidable challenges; drug-related violence has forced artists in cities like {place: Monterrey}, {place: Guadalajara}, and {place: Tijuana} to relocate to {place: Mexico City} and {place: L.A}.

{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} round out their Mexican tour stop with a call-in to {tag: Sesiones TV} host and music journalist {name: Alejandro Franco} in {place: Mexico City}. Their mission? To find out what Mexican music fans are listening to right now. Franco says that while rockers {artist: Zoe} are topping the charts, it's {artist: Carla Morrisson} and {artist: Juan Cirerol} who are packing Mexico City's hipster clubs. And check out our Mexico [playlist](http://open.spotify.com/user/soundopinions/playlist/2EqE2GLtkJgRPbZHQppFEw) on {tag: Spotify}.

## 00:43:59 Review: Mavis Staples
![One True Vine](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music2/v4/a5/89/9f/a5899fbc-36a2-3e5a-9891-889092ca669c/source/600x600bb.jpg "49985/630283619")


{artist: Mavis Staples} has released her 13th studio album called {album: One True Vine}. She tapped {artist: Wilco}'s {name: Jeff Tweedy} to {tag: produce} for the 2nd time, but this time around, {host: Jim} says, he is not so awed by her. The material is better and the sparse production showcases her voice more. Jim says {tag: Buy It} to this dark, quiet record. {host: Greg}, who knows a thing or three about Mavis Staples and Wilco, has admired all the singer's recent albums. And he thinks she's achieved one of the greatest second acts in rock history. He gives this "American treasure" a {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:50:55 DIJ: Jim
{host: Jim} recently made a trip back to his home state of {place: New Jersey} and did a lot of driving. So he stumbled upon a classic rock station playing "{track: America}" by {artist: Simon and Garfunkel}. This song never fails to choke him up, even the versions by Yes and Bowie. It deserves a prominent spot in the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}.
