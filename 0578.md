## 00:01:01 Interview: The Mekons

To put it simply, {artist : The Mekons} are a bit of an enigma. The 40-year-old band hails from the {genre : English punk scene}, with contemporaries including {artist : The Sex Pistols} and {artist : The Clash}. However since 1977, The Mekons have been writing their own unique narrative. The group worshipped {genre : American roots music} from artists like {artist : Hank Williams}, and blended their raucous live performance style with sounds of {genre : punk}, {genre : country}, {genre : folk} and more. The Mekons have always had a revolving line-up, and three members joined Jim and Greg for a chat and live performance: Jon Langford, Tom Greenhalgh and Lu Edmonds. They talk about their long career, a short stint on a major label and the unusual methods used to record their latest album, {album : Existentalism}.

Born and raised in {place : New Orleans}, Richard got her start in the {artist : Diddy}-formed girl group {artist : Danity Kane} in the {era : early 2000s}. She eventually became a solo artist, and her new record {album : Redemption} is the last in a trilogy of albums. {host : Greg} was really impressed by this record and Richard's ability to make meaningful and political {genre : electronic music}. In addition to her smart lyrics, he commends her vocal ability and impact as a budding artist. Greg gives it a {tag : Buy It}. {host : Jim} is in agreement, he thinks Richard's album shows the best side of thoughtful electronic music. Jim loves that Richard is finally getting to make the kind of music she wants, and gives Redemption a {tag : Buy It}.



## 00:51:02 DIJ: Greg

{host : Greg}'s {tag : desert island jukebox} pick this week pays tribute to the late {artist : Mose Allison}. The great {genre : jazz} pianist died this November at age 89. Allison had a  storied career and impacted artists outside of the jazz world like {artist : Pete Townshend} and {artist : John Mayall}.
