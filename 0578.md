To put it simply, {artist: The Mekons} are a bit of an enigma. The 40-year-old band hails from the {genre: English punk scene}, with contemporaries including {artist: The Sex Pistols} and {artist: The Clash}. However since 1977, The Mekons have been writing their own unique narrative. The group worshipped {genre: American roots music} from artists like {artist: Hank Williams}, and blended their raucous live performance style with sounds of {genre: punk}, {genre: country}, {genre: folk} and more. The Mekons have always had a revolving line-up, and three members joined Jim and Greg for a chat and live performance: Jon Langford, Tom Greenhalgh and Lu Edmonds. They talk about their long career, a short stint on a major label and the unusual methods used to record their latest album, {album: Existentalism}.

She eventually became a solo artist, and her new record {album: Redemption} is the last in a trilogy of albums. {host: Greg} was really impressed by this record and Richard's ability to make meaningful and political {genre: electronic music}. In addition to her smart lyrics, he commends her vocal ability and impact as a budding artist. Greg gives it a {tag: Buy It}. {host: Jim} is in agreement, he thinks Richard's album shows the best side of thoughtful electronic music. Jim loves that Richard is finally getting to make the kind of music she wants, and gives Redemption a {tag: Buy It}.


## 00:51:02 DIJ: Greg
{host: Greg}'s {tag: desert island jukebox} pick this week pays tribute to the late {artist: Mose Allison}. The great {genre: jazz} pianist died this November at age 89. Allison had a  storied career and impacted artists outside of the jazz world like {artist: Pete Townshend} and {artist: John Mayall}.
