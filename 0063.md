# Show 63: Valentine's Day Live with Robbie & Donna Fulks
{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} love to love. And this week on the show they celebrate {tag: Valentine's Day} by discussing some of the greatest love, lust, and heartbreak songs in rock and roll. The hosts are joined by {genre: alt-country} troubadour {artist: Robbie Fulks}, with his own true love {name: Donna Fulks}, as well as a live studio audience.

## 00:03:21 News: 02.09.07
This week {tag: Apple} CEO {name: Steve Jobs} called on the music industry to start selling songs without copy protection software, or DRM. Right now, music purchased digitally may not be compatible with all music players. And, in an open letter, Jobs explained that this kind of protection is not only a challenge for the consumer, but doesn't actually thwart piracy. Jim and Greg never expected to hear this kind of statement being made by a major corporate head, but they wonder what his motivation is. It's unlikely that the labels will actually follow Jobs' advice; more likely they'll all agree to use the {tag: iTunes} format.

{tag: Target} entered the music business this week. In an attempt to cash in on a vital demographic, the retail corporation has started a music label geared at "adult" consumers. While much of the music industry is going digital, there are still older music fans who want to buy CDs. With a roster that includes artists like {artist: David Cassidy}, {artist: Kenny Loggins}, and {artist: Kris Kristofferson}, Jim recommends Target set up kiosks in local nursing homes.

Another slick business move is being made by the "{tag: Prince of Darkness}." {artist: Ozzy Osbourne} and wife/impresario {name: Sharon Osbourne} announced that tickets for this summer's {tag: Ozzfest} will be given away for free. Instead of relying on ticket sales, they plan on making up costs through the sale of concessions and on-site advertising. Ozzy will headline the tour, which is in its 12th year of bringing {genre: hard rock} and {genre: heavy metal} across the nation, but it doesn't appear that any other big names are on the lineup. Jim and Greg suspect that the Osbournes plan to book smaller acts that warrant a ticket price of $0. But they are all in favor of such a creative business move, especially in an industry that desperately needs a new paradigm.

## 00:11:38 Review: Fall Out Boy
![Infinity On High (Deluxe Edition)](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/c8/3b/91/c83b91a6-9369-c59c-20b9-9073ab3f5f5f/source/600x600bb.jpg "28673423/268582103")
Next up Jim and Greg review {artist: Fall Out Boy}'s fourth album, {album: Infinity on High}. The {genre: pop punk} quartet from the {place: Chicago} suburbs sold 3 million copies of its last album, and 15-year-old girls everywhere have been anxiously awaiting the follow-up. Teenagers aren't the only Fall Out Boy fans out there. The band's boss, {label: Def Jam} head {name: Jay-Z}, has also been championing them and arranged a larger-than-life debut. {host: Jim} also counts himself as a fan. He thinks Fall Out Boy is a smart, fun, exuberant band full of the {genre: punk} spirit of bands like {artist: The Ramones}. He admits that the lyrics are nothing profound, but gives the album a {tag: Buy It} for its huge attitude and timeless {genre: pop} songs. {host: Greg} admires how Fall Out Boy conducts itself as a band and thinks lead singer {name: Patrick Stump} has an impressive voice. However, he doesn't think they do a good enough job of differentiating themselves from other pop punk bands like {artist: the All-American Rejects} and {artist: Sum 41}. He wishes they did more with new producers like {name: Babyface}. This critic finds {album: Infinity on High} a little too generic and can only give the album a {tag: Burn It}.

## 00:21:44 List: Valentine's Day Live
With {tag: Valentine's Day} just around the corner, Sound Opinions decided to have an intimate celebration -- just {host: Jim}, {host: Greg}...and a couple hundred of their closest friends. They invited listeners to join them in a live taping at the Chicago Cultural Center. They were also joined by {genre: alt-country} troubadour {artist: Robbie Fulks} and his wife {name: Donna  [Fulks]}. Robbie and Donna agreed to act as the Paul Shaffer of the show and perform the hosts' favorite love, lust and anti-love songs. They also treated the audience to some of Robbie's own songs.

There are so many different types of {genre: love songs} in rock and roll, that Jim and Greg had to divide their picks into 3 different categories: "Love Stinks," "Endless Love," and "Carnal Love." These hit all the notes of heartbreak, romance and lust that run through rock music. Jim and Greg picked out some of their favorite love songs and asked Robbie and Donna to perform them. Here are the selections featured on the show:

#### Love Stinks
- Jim: {artist: Rolling Stones}, "{track: Dead Flowers}"
- Greg: {artist: Richard and Linda Thompson}, "{track: Walking a on Wire}"

#### Endless Love
- Jim: {artist: Mudhoney}, "{track: If I Think}"
- Greg: {artist: Smokey Robinson}, "{track: You Really Got a Hold On Me}"

#### Carnal Love
- Jim: {artist: The Troggs}, "{track: I Want You}"
- Greg: {artist: Amazing Rhythm Aces}, "{track: Third Rate Romance}"

The audience also got a chance to get in on the action. Here are some of their favorite love songs:

- {artist: Sebadoh}, "{track: Not a Friend}"
- {artist: Extreme}, "{track: More Than Words}" 
- {artist: Neutral Milk Hotel}, "{track: In The Aero Plane Over The Sea}" 

Sound Opinions H.Q. also dug up some trivia on two famous {genre: rock} couples. Biographer {name: Michael Streissguth}, who wrote {tag: Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison: The Making of a Masterpiece}, believes that {artist: Johnny Cash} and {artist: June Carter-Cash}'s "song" would have to be "{track: Meet Me in Heaven}." While "{track: Ring of Fire}" encapsulated their relationship early on, "Meet Me in Heaven," is a song the couple loved to perform together later in their life. The lyrics really expressed how Johnny felt about growing old with June.

Also, {name: Charles Cross}, who wrote {tag: Heavier Than Heaven: A Biography of Kurt Cobain}, told us that Kurt and {name: Courtney Love}'s song was an odd one. "{track: Seasons in the Sun}," by {artist: Terry Jacks} was a favorite of the {genre: punk}-loving couple. This was the first song {name: Kurt Cobain} ever purchased on a 45, and he appreciated its origins. The song was based on a French story by {name: Jacques Brel} called "{tag: The Dying Man}." He wrote it for {artist: the Beach Boys}, but that band thought it was a little too dark for them to record. Sounds perfect for Kurt and Courtney.
