## 00:01:45 Special: Victims of the Music Business
![nellie](http://static.soundopinions.org/images/2014/nelliemckay.jpg)
This week Jim and Greg stick it to the man, or more specifically -- record companies. They discuss the phenomenon of major labels pulling the plug on established artists. The most recent victim is {artist: Nellie McKay}, whose album {album: Pretty Little Head} was denied release by {label: Sony Music}. McKay wanted to release one version, Sony wanted to release another, and after the "pretty little" singer told her label to take it or leave it, they left it. Of course, upon hearing the advance copy, our hosts can't necessarily blame them.

Whether you enjoy the music or not, McKay's situation does pose an interesting question of how much creative control an artist has while under major label contract. As Jim states: "As long as there have been major labels, there have been executives deciding that they know better than the artist." What are some of the other lost albums that fell prey to the big bad record company? Jim and Greg list off some of their favorites, including:

#### The Butthole Surfers
During the {era: early '90s} when "{genre: alternative}" music was achieving commercial success, {artist: The Butthole Surfers} were signed to {label: Capitol}. When the alternative fad waned, their label no longer appreciated the band's weird aesthetic and refused to release their album {album: After The Astronaut}. The Buttholes sued Capitol and demanded early release from their contract. The record, however, remained under Capitol ownership. Fans needn't fret though; most of the material was re-recorded and released by {label: Hollywood Records}.

#### Wilco
The hometown favorite's album, {album: Yankee Hotel Foxtrot}, was delayed release by its label because it was more conceptual than it was {genre: pop}. Conceptual, of course, is hard to sell, so {label: Reprise Records} asked {name: Jeff Tweedy} and his bandmates to go back into the studio and find a hit. {artist: Wilco} decided to stand by its album, and bid farewell to Reprise. Normally it would take a lot of time and money to recover tapes made under a label's contract, but in this case, Reprise let Wilco take their music, rather than face a public relations nightmare. The album was eventually released in 2002 by a different {label: Warner Music} subsidiary and ended up being the biggest selling of their career. The story played out very nicely in life, [in film](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0327920/), and most importantly, [in print](http://www.wilcobook.com/).

#### Fiona Apple
This singer's label woes were perhaps the most highly publicized of the bunch, but according to our experts, the often difficult artist needs to take some of the blame. {name: [Fiona] Apple} decided to work with producer {name: Jon Brion} for a third time, but felt she needed more time on this effort. {label: Epic Records}, not pleased with what they'd been hearing all along, told Apple that they'd need to approve a track at a time. Or at least that's what she thought she heard. In a dramatic move, Apple stopped recording, leaving the album unfinished. Neither Epic nor Apple wanted to release the music, however some of the songs leaked, and the [response](http://www.freefiona.com/
) was so overwhelming that Apple was inspired to start working again. This time, she joined up with producers {name: Mike Elizondo} and {name: Brian Kehew}, and {album: Extraordinary Machine} can be heard in not one, but two forms.

## 00:21:46 Classic Album Dissection: Revolver
![Revolver](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/b3/db/c7/b3dbc75f-4146-3556-ffce-4b679b3aca7e/source/600x600bb.jpg "136975/401136641")

{album: Revolver} recently celebrated its 40th anniversary. To honor that, our own rock scientists, Drs. DeRogatis and Kot, decided to dissect {artist: The Beatles}' masterpiece. In their discussion, as well as in their interview with Geoff Emerick, the man who engineered the album at {tag: Abbey Road}, you'll hear an in-depth breakdown of what made the music so revolutionary. Here's a sampling of fun-facts and analysis listeners will hear about the different tracks:

#### Tomorrow Never Knows
The last song on {album: Revolver} was actually the first one written. In December 1965, after a mind-expanding acid trip, John Lennon wrote what would later become "{track: Tomorrow Never Knows}." The completely unique four-track song, with its organ drones, backward guitar, bird calls, and megaphone vocals, perfectly encapsulates what {album: Revolver} was about: revolution. Two interesting points come up in Jim and Greg's discussion with {name: Geoff Emerick} about Lennon's lack of technical prowess. Not being able to really communicate how he wanted his vocals to sound technically, he simply asked Emerick to have his voice sound like monks singing on the top of a mountain. Also, the backwards guitar part was merely a happy accident. Lennon, not knowing how to run a reel-to-reel machine, simply loaded the tape backwards and liked what he heard.

#### Rain
The interesting thing about "{track: Rain}" is that it wasn't even released as part of the original {album: Revolver} album. It was the B-side of a single (paired with "{track: Paperback Writer}") that was recorded during the same session. {label: EMI} expected the Beatles to write and record not only an amazing album, but hit singles as well. Jim recommends fans burn their own complete {album: Revolver} with the addition of these singles.

#### Yellow Submarine
Geoff Emerick's description of recording "{track: Yellow Submarine}" is one of the most entertaining in his book. The session was attended by a raucous group of notable guests including {name: Mick Jagger}, {name: Brian Jones}, {name: Marianne Faithful} and {name: Patti Harrison}. In the middle of recording Lennon decided that he wanted to sound like he was singing underwater, and in fact, suggested that he do just that. Out of desperation, the engineer relented and agreed to try it with the microphone placed in a milk bottle filled with water. In order to protect the microphone he used a condom provided by longtime Beatles roadie {name: Mal Evans}.

#### Eleanor Rigby
Emerick was really innovative in how he recorded different instruments. This is particularly evident on this song, written by {name: Paul McCartney}, which incorporates an eight-piece string section. In fact, none of The Beatles actually played on "{track: Eleanor Rigby}." In order to get the best possible sound, Emerick placed the microphones just inches away from the two violas, two cellos and four violins. Beatles fans are so used to hearing this song so it's hard to imagine what it would be like to experience it for the first time in 1966 on the same record with more traditional sounding {genre: rock} songs like "{track: Good Day Sunshine}" and "{track: Got to Get You Into My Life}."

#### Taxman
{album: Revolver} marks significant growth in the band's sound, as well as for the individual Beatles. {name: George Harrison} really matured as a songwriter during the recording of this album, which has an unprecedented three songs written by him, as opposed to chief songwriters Lennon and McCartney. While Harrison is often thought of as the more transcendental Beatle, Jim notes that "{track: Taxman}" expresses a very normal, earthy concern: paying taxes. While, Harrison grew as a songwriter, Emerick admits that he still struggled with the guitar during some of the recording of this album. After wrestling for almost nine hours with the famous "Taxman" guitar solo, the part ended up being handed over to {name: Paul McCartney}, who hit it in one take.

## 00:47:40 List: Revolver covers

## 00:51:06 DIJ: Greg 
It is Greg's turn to pop a quarter into the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}, but this week he had a hard time choosing just one song. According to our host, {genre: hip hop} star {artist: Missy Elliott} is the top singles artist of the last 10 years. Along with producers like {name: Timbaland}, she makes truly avant-garde music, but does so in a really fun, accessible way. Therefore, it's no wonder that her songs are hits critically and commercially. For this week's show, Greg went with the song "{track: Work It}." The song demonstrates Missy's novel approach to sounds and words. It isn't really about anything new, but the lyrics, beats and sounds (note the elephant's wail) couldn't sound fresher. In fact, only Missy Elliott could get away with having the hook to a {genre: Top 40} hit be sung backwards. So, you may not be able to sing along to this week's DIJ, but you'll certainly want to.
