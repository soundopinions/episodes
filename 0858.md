## 00:00:55 Review: Jack White

![Jack White Fear Of The Dawn](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/858/1J2.jpg)

{artist : Jack White} attained guitar hero status for his work in {artist : The White Stripes}, but last month released his fourth album under his own name, {album : Fear Of The Dawn}. It has a broader sonic palette than his previous albums and Jim and Greg end up disagreeing on how successful it is.



## 00:08:08 Review: Sharon Van Etten

![Sharon Van Etten Weve Been Going About This All Wrong](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/858/DK1.jpg)

{artist : Sharon Van Etten}'s sixth album {album : We've Been Going About This All Wrong} is intended to be heard as a whole. There have been no advance singles available before the release date. Jim and Greg agree the wait is worth it, though. They both think this could be the best album she's ever made.



## 00:16:55 Feature: Elephant 6

Author {tag : Adam Clair} spent 13 years writing “Endless Endless: A Lo-Fi History of the Elephant 6 Mystery.” Three of those years he lived in {place : Athens, Georgia} immersing himself in the community of musicians who made {tag : Elephant 6} legendary.
