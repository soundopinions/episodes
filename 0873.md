## 00:00:41 Review: Beyoncé

![Beyonc RENAISSANCE](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/873/1512.jpg)

In her first solo album since the groundbreaking Lemonade, {artist : Beyoncé} has another winner with {album : Renaissance}. Jim and Greg say she is working with the top producers in the world, but retains her individuality and humanity in this project.



## 00:07:28 Review: Drive-By Truckers

In their fourteenth album, {artist : Drive-By Truckers} are as potent as ever, making {album : Welcome 2 Club XIII} well worth a listen. As long-time admirers of the band, Jim and Greg appreciate the clear-eyed lyrics that look back at the band's early days and out at the music community.
