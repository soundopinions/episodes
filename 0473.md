# Show 473: Bloodshot Records & Opinions on D'Angelo.

![bloodshot2](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2014/bloodshot_web.jpg)

{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} look back at 20 years of the groundbreaking {genre: alt-country} label {label: Bloodshot Records}. Plus a review of the long-awaited new album by soul artist D'Angelo. 


## 00:02:06 Intro: Music News
Just when {artist: Taylor Swift} is shaking off {tag: Spotify}, her friend and {tag: singer-songwriter} {artist: Ed Sheeran} is embracing it. In {era: 2014}, Sheeran was the most streamed artist on Spotify with over 860 million listens. He also sold more than 1 million copies of his album {album: *X*} in the UK alone, proving it *is* possible for an artist to have albums available to stream, while still selling physical copies. Sheeran says Spotify helps him do what he does best, and he is embarking on a world tour starting out at {place: Wembley Stadium} in July. 

{artist: Bill Withers}, {artist: Lou Reed} and {artist: Joan Jett} are just a few of the musicians about to be inducted into the {tag: Rock and Roll Hall of Fame} in 2015. However one selection in particular has {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} scratching their heads: {artist: Green Day}. The band becomes 1 of only 48 H.O.F. members who were admitted in their first year of eligibility. This feat is normally reserved for the {name: Willie Mays}-like musical figures, so this choice left our critics a little confused. Also, Greg and Jim note glaring omissions with the bands {artist: Chic}, {artist: Kraftwerk} and {artist: Nine Inch Nails}.


## 00:06:13 Interview: Nan Warshaw and Rob Miller of Bloodshot Records
![bloodshot20](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/473/AD0.jpg)
{label: Bloodshot Records} is celebrating a big birthday this year: 20 years. The label has been home to some hugely influential and well-known artists: {artist: Neko Case}, {artist: Ryan Adams}, {artist: Alejandro Escovedo}, {artist: Jon Langford}, {artist: The Old 97s} and so many more. Founders {name: Rob Miller} and {name: Nan Warshaw} talk about how the label has survived two decades in the tumultuous independent record industry, how {artist: Ryan Adams}'s {album: Heartbreaker} changed its history forever and what Bloodshot albums meant the most to them.


## 00:44:52 Review: D'Angelo
![Black Messiah](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/473/22S0.jpg)
The enigmatic {genre: neo-soul} revolutionary {artist: D'Angelo} is back after 14 years underground with the surprise year-end release of {album: Black Messiah}, the follow-up to his triumphant {era: 2000} album {album: Voodoo}. {host: Greg} couldn't be happier to utter the words "new D'Angelo album," as the multi-instrumentalist singer-songwriter is truly an {genre: R&B} visionary. {album: Black Messiah} sounds like no other music out there. D'Angelo's meticulously layered and sensuous grooves aren't afraid of a little dirt and grime, which fit the record's two overarching themes of love and war perfectly. {host: Jim} credits D'Angelo for being able to connect the dots within, and across, musical genres bringing the past into the present and pushing the present state of R&B into the future. The only problem either critic has with the album is that it came out after they made their best albums of the year lists, because {album: Black Messiah} is easily a contender for number one. An absolute {tag: Buy It} for both Jim and Greg. 


## 00:52:16 DIJ: Jim
While recently flipping through the stacks of his musical library, {host: Jim} came across {album: Beauty and the Beat}, the {era: 1981} debut album from {place: California}'s {artist: The Go-Go's}.  The all-{tag: female} {genre: New Wave} band is probably best known for their hit single "{track: We Got the Beat}," but Jim is a bigger fan of another {album: Beauty and the Beat} song, "{track: Lust to Love}." Written by two of the band's five members, guitarists {name: Jane Wiedlin} and {name: Charlotte Caffey}, "Lust to Love" turns the table on the tired trope of men being the only ones with sexual appetites and is emblematic of the band's underappreciated-at-the-time {genre: power pop} songwriting talent.
