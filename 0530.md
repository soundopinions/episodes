![Shamir](http://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2016/shamir_web.png)

Only a few years into his career, {place: Las Vegas}-based {tag: singer/songwriter} {artist: Shamir} has already explored {genre: house}, {genre: disco}, {genre: indie pop}, {genre: country}, and countless other styles. He joins {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} in the studio for a stripped-down performance and conversation about refusing to be pigeonholed, performing personal songs in front of crowds, and {tag: gender identity}. 


## 00:02:09 News: 01.22.16
    
Fans continue to mourn the death of {artist: David Bowie}, who died January 10th. His most recent album, {album: Blackstar}, released two days before his death, rose to #1 in {place: America} as fans and strangers alike tuned in to hear Bowie's last artful words. {album: Blackstar}'s huge sales represent a trend found in Nielsen's 2015 music report, which says rock music is going strong. According to {tag: Nielsen}, {genre: rock} is the #1 genre for album salesâ€”33% of albums sold in {place: North America} were rock. Though {genre: pop} and {genre: R&B} may be topping the charts, rock gets sold the most. 

Music streams continue to be popular with listeners and are up 93%. But, there's hope for high fidelity fans too: {tag: MusicWatch} reported an estimated 25 million U.S. consumers are willing to pay more money for higher sound quality. And while we live in a digital world, {tag: radio}, surprisingly, remains people's #1 source for music discovery. 

![Adele](http://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2016/adele-bbc.jpg)
The biggest winner in 2015 was, of course, {artist: Adele}. Her record {album: 25} accounted for 3.1% of all album sales in 2015 and 16% of all album sales during the six weeks following its release. So, it's not surprising that she was the most searched artist according to the {tag: BBC} and {tag: Shazam}. The BBC allows you to [find out](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-446211a5-003b-45e3-9211-cdc7d75c5407)  what people are searching for in your city, and also, that city's "musical twin."

## 00:06:41 Interview: Shamir

{artist: Shamir} has been on {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}'s radar since they caught him at last year's [{tag: SXSW Music Conference}](http://soundopinions.org/show/487/). Born {name: Shamir Bailey}, the 21-year-old {place: Las Vegas} native has been stylistically restless his whole life. He formed an {genre: indie pop} duo in high school, explored a love of {genre: country} music, and incorporates the sounds of vintage {place: Chicago} {genre: house} and {genre: disco} on his {genre: electronic pop} recordings. After being blown away by a demo tape, producer and music writer {name: Nick Sylvester} took an interest in Shamir. Sylvester's {label: GODMODE} label released the {album: North Town} EP in 2014, followed by a debut full-length called {album: Ratchet} in 2015. {album: Ratchet} earned widespread critical acclaim, including high spots in both Jim and Greg's [best of the year lists](http://soundopinions.org/show/524/). Shamir stopped by the Sound Opinions studios a few months back and, after greeting the entire staff with hugs, sat down with Jim and Greg for a stripped-down performance on acoustic guitar and piano and a conversation.


## 00:45:00 Review: Savages
![Adore Life](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music6/v4/74/14/bc/7414bc2b-1707-71f5-f6c3-095b32d54cfc/source/600x600bb.jpg "614946147/1048053274")

The {genre: post-punk} band {artist: Savages} is back with their second album {album: Adore Life}. The group's first album, {album: Silence Yourself}, was a big hit with Jim and Greg.  And {host: Jim} is not disappointed with the new one, which posits that there's nothing silly about love songs. These are twisted, dark and unconventional with none of the band's hellfire sacrificed. {host: Greg} agrees, praising this departure and each band member's contribution--from the propulsive rhythm section of bassist {name: Ayse Hassan} and drummer {name: Fay Milton} to guitarist {name: Gemma Thompson}'s innovative guitar noise to {name: Jehnny Beth}'s vocal intensity. *Adore Life* gets a double {tag: Buy It}.


## 00:51:38 DIJ: Greg

{host: Greg}'s {tag: Desert Island Jukebox} selection this week is inspired by the death of {genre: R&B} and {genre: soul} singer {artist: Otis Clay} on January 8th. It got Greg thinking about his track "{track: Trying to Live My Life Without You}." Most people will remember {artist: Bob Seger}'s version of the song. And as Greg explains, Seger was such a fan, he was angry when the {artist: Eagles} released something similar: "{track: The Long Run}." Eagles member {name: Glenn Frey} also died this week, but it's the Clay original Greg chooses to remember.
