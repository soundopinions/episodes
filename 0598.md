# Show 598: Fictional Bands, "Convoy" & Opinions on Gorillaz
![Fictional Bands](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2017/fictionalbands_web.jpg)

Some bands are are born, and some are just made up. Jim and Greg share some of their favorite {tag: fictional bands} from movies, TV, and more. Plus, a review of the new album from cartoon creation {artist: Gorillaz}, and the strange story of {artist: C.W. McCall}'s trucker hit "{track: Convoy}."

## 00:01:45 Review: Gorillaz
![Humanz (Deluxe)](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music122/v4/36/88/3c/36883c53-273b-37eb-7dec-8d0d700ce708/source/600x600bb.jpg "567072/1217911994")
The {tag: virtual band} led by {artist: Blur}'s {artist: Damon Albarn}, {artist: Gorillaz}, is back with the group's fifth album. While they may technically be a "fictional" band, their impressive record and concert sales are very real. Their new record, {album: Humanz}, features collaborations with artists like {artist: Mavis Staples}, {artist: Pusha T}, {name: Jehnny Beth} of {artist: Savages}, {artist: Grace Jones} and more. {host: Jim} thinks Humanz is another great and creative effort from Gorillaz. He thinks the guest cameos work well from track to track, and that Damon Albarn created an interesting, dystopian effort. He gives it a {tag: Buy It}. {host: Greg} is also a big Gorillaz fan, and thinks that Albarn gets the best out of his guests, and particularly loves the cameos from new artist {artist: Benjamin Clementine} and {genre: rap}per {artist: Vince Staples}. While he doesn't think much of the collaboration track from Albarn and "enemy" {name: Noel Gallagher} of {artist: Oasis}, he thinks Humanz is a great end of the world party soundtrack. He gives it a {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:08:48 List: Fictional Bands
   A {tag: fictional band} is a band where everything about them is made up: from a fictitious origin story to imaginary members. However, they make real music (or at least someone behind the scenes makes it). Greg and Jim share a few of their favorites:

### Greg
- {artist: Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem} – {album: The Muppet Show}
- {artist: Dewey Cox} – {album: Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story}
- {artist: CB4} – {album: CB4}
- {artist: Autobahn} – {album: The Big Lebowski}

### Jim
- {artist: Sex Bob-omb} – {album: Scott Pilgrim vs. the World}
- {artist: The Banana Splits} – {album: The Banana Splits Adventure Hour}
- {artist: Crucifictorius} – {album: Friday Night Lights}
- {artist: The Fabulous Stains} – {album: Ladies and Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains}

## 00:40:11 Feature: C.W. McCall's "Convoy"
![Convoy](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2017/convoy_web.jpg)
{artist: C.W. McCall} had a surprise #1 hit in 1976 with the novelty {genre: country} song "{track: Convoy}," sparking a global {tag: C.B. radio} craze. But C.W. McCall was, in fact, a fictional creation. Producer {name: Evan Chung} tells the strange story of how "Convoy" became a cultural phenomenon. He speaks with the songwriters behind "Convoy" – ad executive-turned-lyricist/vocalist {name: Bill Fries} and composer {name: Chip Davis} (later of {artist: Mannheim Steamroller} fame) – who reveal the origins of C.W. McCall in a series of {place: Nebraska} bread commercials. With its tale of {genre: trucker} rebellion told through C.B. radios, "Convoy" reflected actual nationwide strikes by truck drivers in the '70s. Historian [{name: Meg Jacobs}](http://wws.princeton.edu/faculty-research/faculty/megj), author of [*Panic at the Pump: The Energy Crisis and the Transformation of American Politics in the 1970s*](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780809075072), explains how the {tag: oil crisis} of 1973 upended Americans' self-perception as consumers and led to turmoil across the country. Like the song "Convoy" itself, it's an odd, rollicking tale that takes many surprising turns.
