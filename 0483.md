![Nick Mason](http://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2015/nickmason_web.jpg)

{artist: Pink Floyd} drummer {name: Nick Mason} has been the only constant member of the band throughout its entire history. He speaks with {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} about his half-century with the pioneering {genre: psychedelic} {genre: rock} band and their highly anticipated reunion. Later, a review of the surprise new mixtape from {artist: Drake}.

## 00:02:30 News: 2.26.15
No matter what you thought of this year's {tag: Oscars}, {tag: Grammys} or {tag: Superbowl}, one thing is certain: {tag: TV} sells. After {artist: Common} and {artist: John Legend}'s emotional performance at the {tag: Academy Awards}, industry forecasters predict a big sales bump for the winning tune "{track: Glory}." Just a few hours after the ceremony ended, the song was projected to post a 70% gain. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} predict similar success for {artist: Lady Gaga}, who wowed skeptics with her "{tag: Sound of Music}" belting. Music from the {tag: Grammys} is also going like gangbusters. {tag: *Album of the Year*} winner {artist: Beck} has enjoyed a 483% sales increase. And, {album: Nostalgia}, the new album by {tag: Grammy} performer {artist: Annie Lennox}, shot up 335%. But perhaps most curious of them all is the musical effect of the Superbowl. Albums and songs by halftime performer {artist: Katy Perry} experienced a 92% sales boost.

In other news, happy 50th birthday {artist: Dr. Dre}! The rapper and entrepreneur celebrated with an appearance on the front page of {tag: *AARP*}. That's right...the magazine for the {tag: American Association of Retired Persons}. But, while that is certain to make a lot of music fans feel old, no one is in a better position to retire than the hip hop O.G. He again topped {tag: *Forbes*}' list for the highest paid musicians of the year with a whopping $620 million earned. 


## 00:08:01 Interview: Nick Mason
![Pink Floyd](http://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2015/Pink%20Floyd.jpg)
In the annals of {genre: rock 'n' roll} there are few bands cited for both their critical acclaim and commerical sales. One is {artist: Pink Floyd}. Its drummer, {name: Nick Mason}, joins Jim and Greg to talk about the {place: U.K.} band's history and recent decision to reunite to release what many believe will be its final album, {album: The Endless River}. Mason is the only member of the band to survive all of its squabbles and play on each studio album. He explains how {album: The Endless River} is a tribute to the Pink Floyd's iconic keyboardist {name: Rick Wright}. He also recalls the early dynamics between {name: David Gilmour} and {name: Roger Waters} and how he feels about the band's legacy with its 15th (and final?) release.

## 00:43:33 Review: Drake
![If You're Reading This It's Too Late](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/pf/us/r30/Music1/v4/40/f4/4d/40f44d08-a776-fada-c440-2cc80bcad810/UMG_cvrart_00602547261908_01_RGB72_1500x1500_15UMGIM08571.600x600-75.jpg "271256/966988592")
{artist: Drake}'s release of his latest opus {album: If You're Reading This It's Too Late} was a complete surprise, à la {artist: Beyoncé} -- though there's debate whether to classify it as a mixtape or a proper album. The {place: Canadian} superstar is once again working with producer {name: Noah  "40"  Shebib}. {host: Greg} credits Drake and Shebib for creating a uniquely atmospheric aesthetic for his introspective {genre: rap}. But the minimalist beats make this feel half-finished: there are no hooks or {genre: pop} hits, and the record never picks up steam until the end. {host: Jim} won't even concede any originality in the production. He says, Drake has been ripping off {artist: Kanye West}'s 
{album: 808s & Heartbreak} his entire career. To Jim, Drake is incredibly hard to like, as he continues to whine about his petty personal problems. *If You're Reading This It's Too Late* gets a double {tag: Trash It}.


## 00:50:42 DIJ: Greg
Lately {host: Greg} has been binging on the music of {place: Australia}n songwriter {name: Richard Davies}. Davies has worked as a solo artist and also released an album with {name: Eric Matthews} under the moniker {artist: Cardinal}. But this week Greg is especially drawn to Davies' first band, {artist: The Moles}, which merged {genre: baroque pop} and {genre: psychedelia} with a skewed sense of melody. The Moles' {era: 1992} single "{track: What's the New Mary Jane}" lifts its title from a famous {artist: [The] Beatles} outtake, but it's much more substantive than what the {tag: Fab Four} actually recorded. It's a twisted, druggy slice of {genre: pop} music unlike anything else coming out during the {genre: grunge} era, so it earns its place in the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}.
