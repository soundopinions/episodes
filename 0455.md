# Show 455: Rock Operas

![kelis](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2014/rockoperas_web.jpg)

Forget about *Carmen* or *Madame Butterfly*. Sound Opinions' own divas, Jim and Greg, share their favorite **{tag: Rock Operas}**. 

## 00:02:27 Intro: Music News
Some interesting chart news this week: Despite being music vets, {artist: Tom Petty} and {artist: Weird Al Yankovic}, both just achieved their first #1 in the past month. Over on the {genre: Jazz} charts, {artist: Tony Bennett}, who himself took 54 years to produce #1, has reached another hight, this time with strange bedfellow  {artist: Lady Gaga}. Comic book fans are showing their support for {tag: Marvel}'s most recent super-powered adventure, {tag: *Guardians of The Galaxy*}. The soundtrack for the flick, an eclectic mix of '70s {genre: rock}, {genre: soul}, and {genre: pop} staples, is the current chart topper, beating out the prolific {tag: Now} series, {album: Volume 51}.  Over on the {tag: vinyl} end of things, {artist: Jack White's} most recent release, {album: Lazaretto}, is making history with its soaring sales. The LP has already sold over 60,000 copies, the most since {artist: Pearl Jam}'s {era: 1994} album {album: Vitalogy}. 

## 00:09:41 List: Rock Operas
For many music fans, when you hear "**{genre: Rock Opera}**," you probably think of {artist: The Who}'s {era: 1969} album {album: Tommy}. But, Jim and Greg assert that {album: Tommy} is neither the first, nor the best, Rock Opera. Credit for the first goes to {album: S.F. Sorrow} by {artist: The Pretty Things} in {era: 1968}. Credit for the best? Well, there's a long list throughout music history, including those listed below. But whatever your favorite, just don't call it a concept album! 

- {artist: The Who}'s {album: Quadrophenia} 
- {artist: Genesis}' {album: The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway}
- {artist: Green Day}'s {album: American Idiot}
- {artist: Willie Nelson}'s {album: Red Headed Stranger}
- {artist: Janelle Monae}'s {album: The Archandroid}
- {artist: The Pretty Things}'s {album: S.F. Sorrow}
- {artist: The Kinks}' {album: Arthur}
- {artist: Lou Reed}'s {album: Berlin}
- {artist: David Bowie}'s {album: Ziggy Stardust}
- {artist: Frank Zappa}'s {album: Joe's Garage}
- {artist: Pink Floyd}'s {album: The Wall }
- {artist: The Decemberists}' {album: Crane Wife}
- {artist: Neil Young} and Crazy Horse's {album: Greendale }

## 00:50:54 DIJ: Jim
Inspired by a recent trip to {place: Portland}, OR for a special taping of the show with {artist:Broken Bells} (stay tuned to hear it!), {host: Jim} spends his latest trip to the Desert Island remembering The City of Roses's {genre: 1980}'s {genre: hardcore punk} scene. Jim tells us that trailblazers like {name: Greg Sage} and his {artist: Wire}-esque band {artist: The Wipers} never quite get the credit they deserve for laying the groundwork for {place: Seattle}'s grunge music explosion in the '90's. ({artist: Nirvana} actually covered a couple {artist: Wipers} tunes.) Another prominent Portland-area hardcore band, {artist: Poison Idea}, was also influenced by Sage. Specifically the band's guitarist, {name: Tom Roberts}, better known as {name: Pig Champion}. Jim recalls that what Roberts may have lacked in showmanship (he mostly sat on a folding chair while on stage), he made up for in sheer {genre: metal} {tag: guitar} prowess. Sadly, Roberts passed away in 2006 at the age of only 47. So this week, Jim pays tribute to both the Portland hardcore scene and Robert's indelible mark on it, by playing a live recording of {artist: Poison Idea}'s {artist: Wipers} cover "{track: Up Front}," which features more than 12-minutes of Robert's virtuoso guitar.
