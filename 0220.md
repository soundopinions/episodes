## 00:01:45 Intro: Music News

Just when you thought there couldn't be any more posthumous {artist : Jimi Hendrix} releases, there's news that a new album will see the light of day in March. And, we have a preview song called "{track : Valleys of Neptune}." During his short life, Hendrix only released 3 records. But since his death over 30 albums have been released. {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} explain that "Neptune" is reflective of the guitarist's post-{album : Electric Ladyland} period. He was focusing less on guitar work and more on experimental lyrics. And, of equal interest to the music is the business of Hendrix.
