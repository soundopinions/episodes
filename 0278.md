## 00:01:45 Intro: Music News

![Pinetop Perkins](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/278/2X0.jpg)

{genre : Blues}  {tag : piano} player {artist : Pinetop Perkins}  {tag : passed away} this week at age 97. He was one of the last links to the {place : Mississippi Delta} blues era. As {host : Greg} relays, Perkins made his mark as a sideman for people like {artist : Muddy Waters}. It wasn't until he was 75 that he released an album under his own name. He even holds the record for oldest {tag : Grammy winner}. Pinetop Perkins was going strong right up until his death, so to honor him, {host : Jim} and Greg play the song that gave him his name, "{track : Pinetop's Boogie Woogie}," recorded at {place : Sun Studios} in {tag : 1953}.



## 00:06:08 List: SXSW 2011

Music fans and industry insiders have been gathering at the {tag : SXSW Music and Media Conference} in {place : Austin, TX} for twenty-five years. While it has gotten too big for its britches in recent years, {tag : SXSW} remains the place to hear new artists and issues facing the business. {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} didn't have high hopes for this year's {tag : keynote speaker}  {name : Bob Geldof}. What has the {artist : Boomtown Rats} done for us lately? Well, not much. But he provided one of the most insightful keynotes our hosts have ever heard. Geldof, who brought the world {tag : Live Aid}, encouraged American musicians to wake up. He explained that {genre : rock 'n' roll} needs to be against something – whether that's in reality or in spirit. Another noteworthy panel featured independent concert promoters from around the country, as well as {tag : Ticketmaster}  {tag : CEO}  {name : Nathan Hubbard}. The Ticketmaster/{tag : Live Nation}  {tag : merger} was approved last year, and this panel attempted to find out how that has affected the concert industry. There were no concrete answers; ticket prices have skyrocketed but it's too early to attribute this to consolidation.

It's panels by day and music by night. {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} always return from {tag : SXSW} with a truckload of new music. Here are their respective {tag : discoveries} of artists to watch in {tag : 2011}.


### Jim

- {artist : Le Butcherettes}
- {artist : Bewitched Hands}
- {artist : Esben and the Witch}
- {artist : Dominique Young Unique}


### Greg

- {artist : Glasser}
- {artist : PS I Love You}
- {artist : tUne-YarDs}
- {artist : Wild Flag}



## 00:48:15 Review: The Strokes

![Angles](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/278/28F0.jpg)

{artist : The Strokes} hit it big in 2001 by asking the question "{track : Is This It}?" And it seems that it was (couldn't resist). They released two underwhelming subsequent records and then went their separate ways. Now the group is more of a democracy, but the missteps {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} heard on {name : Julian Casablancas}' solo album {album : Phrazes For the Young} are evident on The Strokes' new album {album : Angles}. Jim calls it glossy and overproduced, and wonders where {name : Fabrizio Moretti}'s terrific {tag : drumming} is. But worse, the band sounds "artistically bankrupt." He says {tag : Trash It}. Greg is not so disappointed. Ultimately *Angles* is a failed record, but it tries new things and is more interesting for it. He is optimistic about the future and says {tag : Burn It}.
