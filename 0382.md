# Show 382: SXSW 2013 & Opinions on Justin Timberlake

## 00:01:48 News: 03.22.2013
Seven years later, the saga of file-sharer {name: Jammie Thomas-Rassett} has reached an end. Caught in the net of {tag: file-sharing suits} brought by the {tag: RIAA} in the {era: 2000s}, Thomas-Rassett was the first of the {tag: Kazaa} generation to fight back in court. In a series of four trials she claimed she had not been aware that she was sharing 24 illegal tracks. Now that the {tag: Supreme Court} has declined to review her petition, Thomas-Rassett is on the hook for $220,000 - money she says she doesn't have.

{artist: Jason Molina}, leader of {genre: americana} acts {artist: Songs: Ohia} and {artist: Magnolia Electric Co.} is dead this week at age 39 after a prolonged fight with alcoholism. The singer-songwriter's death prompted a moving tribute from his label, {label: Secretly Canadian}. Molina's was the first single released by Secretly Canadian when the indie label was a fragile upstart in the nineties.

## 00:05:08 List: SXSW 2013
For years {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} have made their annual voyage down to {place: Austin, TX} for the {tag: SXSW Music Conference}. The goal was always clear: discover great new musical acts. And, while they are at it, take the music industry's temperature. But in recent years, {tag: SXSW} has gotten a little too big for its britches with over 2,500 bands and 10,000 registrants. And, as Jim and Greg explain, it's now become a platform for big name stars to advertise products. (Just check out this gross [stage display](http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/doritos-builds-tweet-powered-sxsw-stage-thats-more-awesome-acts-it-147760).) But, if you can side-step the corporate elements (and St. Patty's partiers), there's still a lot to gain in {place: Austin} (including pounds from beer and queso). Jim and Greg were impressed with {name: Dave Grohl}'s passionate {tag: keynote}. And they have another list of up-and-coming bands to watch in the year to come.

## List: The 2013 SXSW discoveries:

### Jim
- {artist: Laura Stevenson}
- {artist: Shout Out Out Out Out}
- {artist: Holydrug Couple}
- {artist: Savages}

### Greg
- {artist: No Ceremony}
- {artist: Guards}
- {artist: Metz}
- {artist: MO}


## 00:48:57 Review: Justin Timberlake
![The 20/20 Experience â€“ 2 of 2](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music4/v4/10/7f/08/107f082e-1b1a-5773-2c97-22ca26453df1/source/600x600bb.jpg "398128/672487211")

Over the past few years we wondered if {artist: Justin Timberlake} had forsaken music for his first profession, acting. But, now he is back with a grand, almost operatic album called {album: The 20/20 Experience}. And while it is an experience full of lengthy, ambitious tracks, {host: Greg} wonders, "where is the soul?" He credits Justin with being smart and stylish, but misses the emotional investment. {album: The 20/20 Experience} is a "snooze," so Greg says {tag: Trash It}. {host: Jim} is less harsh, and recommends you {tag: Burn It}, but only out of pure {genre: pop} curiosity. He believes JT to be a charming entertainer, but doubts he has the darkness to back up this {genre: neo-soul} experiment.
