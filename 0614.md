# Show 614: Back-to-School Songs & Opinions on LCD Soundystem and Van Hunt

![Back-to-School Songs](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2017/backtoschool_web.jpg)

The beginning of September means students return to the classroom. Whether you're excited to be {tag: back-to-school} or the very thought inspires dread and anxiety, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} have put together a playlist to ease back to the grind. Plus, they review albums by {artist: LCD Soundsystem} and {artist: Van Hunt}.


## 00:02:14 Review: LCD Soundsystem
![american dream](//static.soundopinions.org/assets/614/3Q0.jpg "29525428/1258822744")
{artist: LCD Soundsystem} – one of {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}'s favorite bands of the {era: 2000s} – broke up in 2011 after a huge farewell show at {place: Madison Square Garden}. But only six years later, leader {name: James Murphy} has brought the group back for a fourth album, {album: American Dream}. Greg was skeptical after hearing the initial singles. But upon hearing the whole record, he calls it their most emotional work yet, designed to work as an album from beginning to end. He cites the haunted quality in Murphy's voice as he confronts getting older and loves the record's polyrhythmic vibes. While Greg gives it a {tag: Buy It}, it pains Jim to give {album: American Dream} a {tag: Trash It}. He's annoyed at hearing a 47-year-old complain about being old. According to Jim, the new album has lost the sense of humor, groove, and songs of the previous records, and he will never listen to {album: American Dream} again for pleasure.



## 00:09:17 Review: Van Hunt
![Popular](//static.soundopinions.org/assets/614/FH0.jpg "4247226/1267642147")
Soul-rocker {artist: Van Hunt}'s album {album: Popular}, originally slated for release back in 2008, is finally seeing the light of day. According to Greg, the record is "totally contemporary, and totally of the moment… still."  The album, a stylistic diversion from Van Hunt's previous efforts ({album: Van Hunt} [2006] and {album: On the Jungle Floor} [2007]), was shelved by {label: Blue Note Records} after promotional copies had been distributed to critics. Jim and Greg received copies of the album back then and [gave the album an "enthusiastic double {tag: Buy It}"](http://soundopinions.org/show/114/#vanhunt) – despite listeners not being able to purchase the music at the time. Now that {label: Blue Note} has given the record a proper release, Jim and Greg revisited the record. Greg calls it a Freudian, avant-garde take on {artist: Prince}'s {album: Dirty Mind}. He adds that the record has an "adventurous" blend of sonic elements like the mix of {genre: punk} with falsetto {genre: soul} vocals in "{track: Turn My TV On}." Jim says the record was ahead of its time in 2008 and still sounds absolutely fresh and current beside "other genre-bending maestros of {genre: R&B} like {artist: Frank Ocean} and {artist: Kendrick Lamar}." Both {host: Greg} and {host: Jim} give {album: Popular} another double {tag: Buy It} (and this time you can *actually* buy it).
