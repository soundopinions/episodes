## 00:00:35 Review: Robert Finley

{artist : Robert Finley} first came to the attention of the national music scene when he appeared on “America's Got Talent,” but he met Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys a few years before that. They've worked together on three albums now- including the new one: “{album : Black Bayou}.” Jim and Greg agree that it isn't quite as good as his previous efforts.



## 00:08:40 Review: The Feelies

{artist : The Feelies} are elder statesmen of indie rock at this point in their career. So it's nice to see them pay tribute to their inspiration- The Velvet Underground. “{album : Some Kinda Love}” is a live tribute to The Velvet Underground recorded in New Jersey in 2018. Jim and Greg both love it.



## 00:17:27 Feature: Sly and the Family Stone

Sly Stone's memoir was something no one in the music industry expected. So the fact it exists is notable, but Jim and Greg feel it falls short of its potential since it seems Sly doesn't remember many of the most notable episodes in his life.

In 2014 Family Stone members Jerry Martini and Cynthia Robinson spoke with Jim and Greg about their work with Sly Stone during his rise and fall in the music industry.
