## 00:00:00 Review: Geese

On their fourth studio album, “Getting Killed,” Geese have captured the critical imagination of the American music industry. To say Jim and Greg beg to differ is an understatement.


## 00:00:00 Feature: Rough Trade 

Hosts Jim DeRogatis and Greg Kot talk with longtime music industry friend, Geoff Travis, and his business partner, Jeannette Lee, about what drew them to Irish folk music for their newest venture, {label : River Lea} Records. The pair made their name with {label : Rough Trade} Records, the label that defined the sound of British post-punk. But the creativity of a young batch of Irish folk artists led the pair to link up with Tim Chipping to get the music to the world.
