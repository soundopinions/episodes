![Secret Love](http://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2015/secret_web.jpg)
Sometimes a crush has to stay a secret, even when you'd rather proclaim it loudly in candy heart form. In honor of {tag: Valentine's Day}, Jim and Greg offer up a bouquet of their favorite **{tag: Secret Love Songs}**.

## 00:02:13 News: 02.06.15
Former {tag: Death Row Records} mogul {artist: Suge Knight} is facing life in prison. He was arrested for murder and other charges in connection with a hit-and-run incident that left a man dead and another in critical condition. It's a {artist: Phil Spector}-like fall from grace from someone who practically defined {place: West Coast} {genre: hip-hop} in his heyday.

There were quite a few developments this week in the world of digital {tag: streaming}. {tag: SoundExchange} reported that it paid out $773 million in royalties in 2014 for digital performances. This suggests that streaming services and satellite radio may be closing in on old-fashioned terrestrial radio. Even {artist: Jay Z} wants in on the action: he's reportedly bidding on the Swedish streaming company {tag: Aspiro}. Meanwhile, {tag: Spotify} has put the brakes on its planned expansion into {place: Russia} as the ruble tumbles and rumors spread that President {name: Vladimir Putin} is clamping down on media and social networking sites.


## 00:07:31 List: Secret Love Songs for Valentine's Day
![secret](http://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2014/secret.jpg)
As {artist: Aimee Mann} once sung, "Hush Hush, keep it down now...voices carry!" But despite that plea and desire for secrecy, musicians have been coming clean about their loving feelings since the beginning of the rock era. So to celebrate {tag: Valentine's Day} this year, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} reveal their favorite "{tag: Secret Love Songs}." These could be admissions of an illicit romance, expressions of forbidden emotions or professions of a secret crush. Enjoy (but keep it on the down-low).

## 00:48:05 Review: Bob Dylan
![Shadows In the Night](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music3/v4/bc/39/d0/bc39d050-bd16-cddb-d2e8-b77a5df6bb4b/source/600x600bb.jpg "462006/945762927") 
One of {artist: Bob Dylan}'s strengths is his ability to reinvent himself, especially in the '{era: 90s} when he became his own producer under the pseudonym {name: Jack Frost}. Now in his seventies, he consistently takes his touring band into the studio every few years, giving his career a new surge of energy. So it's with that goal that he gives us {album: Shadows in the Night}, which is built around songs recorded by {artist: Frank Sinatra}. {host: Jim} recognizes that while Dylan and Sinatra are two of the most important voices in the last half-century, they don't go well together. Dylan is great when he sings songs that suit him ({genre: folk}, {genre: country}) but it just doesn't work here; he gives it a {tag: Trash It}. {host: Greg} believes that the production of this album and the choices Dylan made saved the record. He said if you care for Bob Dylan at all you should take a listen, giving it a {tag: Try It}.
