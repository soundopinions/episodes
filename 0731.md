With his 1996 album, {album: Endtroducing}, {artist: DJ Shadow} cemented his place in music history for creating what many believe to be the first full-length made entirely of samples. Beyond the technical achievement, the album is considered a landmark of {genre: instrumental hip-hop}. So when Shadow announced his new double-album, {album: Our Pathetic Age}, producer {name: Andrew Gill} jumped at the chance to do a {tag: Sample Platter} segment with him. Shadow explained how he selects samples from his famously large record collection and how the album's first single, "{track: Rocket Fuel}", came together.
