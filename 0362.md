## 00:01:49 News: 11.02.2012
{tag: Singer-songwriter} {artist: Terry Callier} never got the acclaim he deserved in the early part of his life, but as Greg explains, his influence was strong. The {place: Chicago} native released a {label: Chess Records} debut in 1968, and went on to fuse folk with jazz and experimental music. It's a sound that caught the attention of younger artists like {artist: Beth Orton} and {artist: Devendra Banhart}, and you can best hear it on the 1973 track "{track: You're Goin Miss Your Candyman}." 

## 00:06:12 Classic Album Dissection: Live at the Apollo

Before he was {tag: America's Godfather of Soul}, {artist: James Brown }was the king of the {place: South}'s segregated {place: chitlin' circuit}. It took {album: Live at the Apollo} - an album recorded fifty years ago last month on Brown's own dime- to catapult him onto the national stage. In honor of its fiftieth, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} give Brown's *Live at the Apollo* a well-deserved {tag: Classic Album Dissection} with help from music writer {name: RJ Smith}. RJ's biography of Brown, {tag: *The One: The Life and Music of James Brown*}, came out earlier this year. As RJ explains, James Brown was all about the live experience. He knew if radio listeners could just hear his live show, he could be "Gary Cooper big." He was right. High-energy numbers like "Night Train" and "Think" propelled Brown onto the pop charts and super-charged his career. But as Greg notes, *Live at the Apollo* wasn't just a turning point for Brown personally, it was a turning point for music. Suddenly {genre: doo-wop} and {genre: soul} was starting to sound...funky.

## 00:42:50 Review: Neil Young 
![Psychedelic Pill](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/362/1ZE0.jpg)
It's been a busy 2012 for {artist: Neil Young}. Not only has he given us a memoir, {tag: *Waging Heavy Piece*}, he's also given us two albums. This spring we got the antique folk romp {album: Americana}. Now we have {album: Psychedelic Pill }- an epic three records' worth of psychedelic guitar from Neil and the band he was born to play with, {artist: Crazy Horse}.  How good a prescription is *Psychedelic Pill*? Greg's the first to admit there's a lot of flab on this record. But standout tracks like "{track: Ramada Inn}" (about an affair gone sour) and "{track: Walk Like a Giant}" (in which Neil reflects on the hippie dream) make this record a worthwhile, if lengthy, listen. {host: Greg} says {tag: Burn It}. As much as it pains him, Neil's #1 fan {host: Jim} DeRogatis has to disagree. Never has he heard worse lyrics or more self-indulgent guitar from Neil. This record is sprawling in a bad way. Jim says {tag: Trash It}.

## 00:49:19 Review: Kendrick Lamar 
![good kid, m.A.A.d city](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/362/2A70.jpg)

At 25, {artist: Kendrick Lamar }is shouldering some pretty heavy expectations for his major label debut, {album: Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City}. The {place: Compton} rapper caught the attention of {artist: Dr. Dre} and rap tastemakers with his independent debut {album: Section.80}. Does *Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City* live up to all the hype? {host: Jim} acknowledges Kendrick's skill as a {tag: lyricist} - he says his rhymes are almost novelistic - and he understands he is taking on characters in his songs. However he's troubled by the gangsta clichés. No amount of self-awareness, Jim says, makes it OK to indulge in {artist: 50 Cent}-style misogyny. Jim gives *Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City* a {tag: Trash It} rating. {host: Greg} couldn't disagree more. He thinks Lamar has yet to meet the rap cliché he couldn't upend. *Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City* is wrestling with Compton's legacy in a way that eludes sound bites and lyrics-quoting. Greg says it's a {tag: Buy It} record that requires close listening.
