# Show 3: Album Box Set Gift Guide
This week Sound Opinions offers its annual gift-giving guide. Jim and Greg will run down their picks for box sets that are sure to please, and those that are sure to be re-gifted.

![Gift Boxes](http://static.soundopinions.org/images/2005/gifts.jpg)

## 00:03:18 Review: Johnny Cash
![Cash: The Legend](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2006/cashlegend.jpg)
One of numerous {artist: Johnny Cash} box sets, {album: Cash: The Legend} was released in time for the hoopla surrounding the Cash biopic, {tag: Walk the Line}. {host: Jim} first points out that he doesn't like the way the set is organized. He loves the first disc, but is not sure about the rest of the choices. {host: Greg}, the show's resident Cash [expert](http://www.amazon.com/Cash-Rolling-Stone-Magazine/dp/140005480X), thinks this box set is better than most, but is still flawed. It lacks many of Cash's {label: Sun} recordings, as well as his most recent work with super-producer {name: Rick Rubin}. This is a {tag: Burn It} for both critics. {host: Jim}'s {tag: Buy It} picks for Cash fans are {album: Love, God, Murder} and {album: Unearthed}. Greg gets to pick the song this time around, and, much to Jim's dismay, chooses "{track: The Wanderer}," a track written by {artist: U2}. 

## 00:09:57 Review: Ray Charles
![Pure Genius: The Complete Atlantic Recordings](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music4/v4/11/a8/3a/11a83aee-63d2-e615-e5a5-6a5050ffc7cb/source/600x600bb.jpg "160926/80017406")

{artist: Ray Charles} is another deceased musician who has recently been brought back to life in the media. Last year, Charles was profiled in his own biopic, *{tag: Ray}*, and this year his music was featured in a song that was number one for most of {era: 2005} -- {artist: Kanye West}'s "{track: Gold Digger}." {album: Pure Genius: The Complete Atlantic Recordings (1952-1959)} is a six-disc overview of Charles' early period. Charles was signed to {label: Atlantic Records} by {name: Ahmet Ertegun} in the {era: 1950s}, and according to {host: Greg}, these Atlantic recordings came to be what we now know as {genre: R&B} music. The music, originally produced by {name: Jerry Wexler}, will appeal to the {genre: soul} aficionado, but neither {host: Jim} nor Greg can recommend this set as a Buy It for a casual listener. Both say it's a {tag: Burn It}. The song Greg chooses is Charles' original {era: 1954} performance of "{track: I've Got a Woman}," as opposed to {artist: Jamie Foxx}'s rendition you hear on "{track: Gold Digger}."

## 00:14:10 Review: Talking Heads
![Brick](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2006/talkingheadsbrick.jpg)
{artist: Talking Heads}, a band that came out of the {place: New York} {genre: punk} scene in the {era: 1970s}, present their music in this one-stop-shop set. {album: Brick} contains all of the Talking Heads recordings re-mastered in 5.1 Digital Surround Sound by the band's keyboardist, {name: Jerry Harrison}. {host: Jim} is impressed with the comprehensiveness of this set, but admits that he doesn't even own a surround sound system. {host: Greg} was also hoping for more outtakes and rarities, explaining that the set's introduction, written by hipster author {name: Dave Eggers}, does not make it worth the $150 price.

## 00:22:52 Review: Bruce Springsteen
![Born to Run](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music2/v4/aa/5d/e5/aa5de514-eb74-1490-79ac-ca0d18f660bd/dj.rzkbczpe.jpg/600x600bb-85.jpg "178834/310730204")

To {host: Jim}'s dismay, {host: Greg} brought in the 30th anniversary re-issue of {album: Born to Run}, which he calls, "iconic". This {era: 1975} record by {artist: Bruce Springsteen}, was simultaneously on the cover of {tag: Time} and {tag: Newsweek}, and went on to sell over eight million copies. Jim notes that this record came out as the same time of many of the bands in the {place: NY} {genre: punk} scene, and has Springsteen looking back on life, while rockers like {artist: The Ramones} were looking forward. Jim says, to much of our horror, that {artist: Meatloaf} was a better artist. That's right... Meatloaf. Greg admits that in his later years, Springsteen was a choreographed artist, but when this album came out, he was still experimental and learning his craft. Greg thinks the l part of this set, or as he calls it, "the manna," is the DVD of the live Springsteen performance. Greg rates the {album: Born to Run: 30th Anniversary Edition} box as a "{tag: Buy It}," and Jim surprisingly rates it a "{tag: Trash It}."

## 00:31:49 Review: Billy Joel
![My Lives](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music4/v4/50/d6/1e/50d61e11-4f19-ecc3-a2ad-78877bb8efdb/source/600x600bb.jpg "485953/383633357")

Finally, something {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} can agree on: {artist: Billy Joel} is a hack. The cover of {album: My Lives}, painted by Joel's daughter, actually makes him look worse than normal, according to Jim. The reason this box set is so skippable, according to Greg, is that it is comprised entirely of outtakes. The boys play "{track: Only the Good Die Young}," and as if that wasn't bad enough, it's the {genre: reggae} version. Both Jim and Greg give the box set a "{tag: Trash It}" rating.

## 00:35:34 Review: The Ramones
![Weird Tales of the Ramones](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2006/ramones.jpg)
{host: Jim} calls {artist: The Ramones} "one of the most important bands America has ever produced." This box set, {album: Weird Tales of the Ramones}, contains more outtakes than ever, and makes the set worth owning, even though he would have rather seen "{track: Rock and Roll High School}" included as the bonus DVD. The most important part of the set, according to {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}, is the 54-page comic strip-style liner notes, with contributing artists like {name: Jamie Hernandez}, {name: John Holmstrom}, {name: Bill Griffin}, and {name: Sergio Aragonés}. Greg notes that most box set liner notes are written by pompous critics, and feels that these should win a {tag: Grammy} award for their style and flair. Both Jim and Greg heartily give this a "{tag: Buy It}" rating.

## 00:42:19 Review: One Kiss Can Lead to Another: Girl Group Sounds, Lost & Found
![One Kiss Can Lead to Another: Girl Group Sounds, Lost & Found](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2017/One-Kiss-Can-Lead-To-Another-Girl-Group-Sounds-Lost-Found-CD2-cover.jpg)
Jim and Greg give the box set {album: One Kiss Can Lead to Another: Girl Groups Sounds Lost and Found} their vote for best packaging. The four discs of {genre: girl group} songs are contained in a highly girly hat box. However, while this is an exciting set to un-wrap, according to our hosts, the song collection is disappointing. That's largely because {label: Rhino Records} was unable to get the rights to songs produced by {name: Phil Spector}, the man Jim calls the architect of this genre. Spector gave his signature "{tag: Wall of Sound}" effect to {artist: The Beatles} and girl groups like {artist: The Ronettes} (featuring Spector's then-wife {name: Ronnie Bennett}). {album: Lost and Found} only has a one obscure {artist: Ronettes} track, however, and none of the major hits from {artist: The Shirelles} or {artist: The Chiffons}. Rather, it is packed with "second-tier" groups like {artist: The Honeys} and {artist: The Goodees}. In addition, it includes solo artists like {artist: Mary Wells}, {artist: Cher}, {artist: Dolly Parton}, and even super-waif {artist: Twiggy}, who were all trying to cash in, unsuccessfully, on the girl group sound. 

## 00:46:42 Review: The Band
![A Musical History (Remastered)](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/1b/5d/f0/1b5df07c-00b0-c0e1-370a-dab22a71ace5/source/600x600bb.jpg "556583/716671978")


{album: A Musical History} from {genre: folk-rock} group {artist: The Band} is one of the most comprehensive sets featured on the show. It contains five CDs with more than one hundred songs, as well as a DVD and a book. Greg suspects that the release of this set is lead singer {name: Robbie Robertson}'s attempt to set the record straight on The Band's history. The many disputes over songwriting credits have been made quite public by some recent biographies, as well as {name: Martin Scorsese} concert film {tag: The Last Waltz}. This set follows the long chronology of this group from its initial incarnation as {artist: The Hawks} to their role as touring band for {artist: Bob Dylan} on the {tag: 1966 Electric Tour}. It also features tracks from {album: The Basement Tapes}, a famous bootleg of songs {name: [Bob] Dylan} and The Band recorded while living in {place: Woodstock}, {place: New York}. Jim and Greg are both really impressed with how packed this set is, and are careful to point out that although Robertson has painted himself as the "auteur" of the group, The Band had many great vocalists including {name: Richard Manuel} and {name: Levon Helm}, the group's drummer. Pressed to come up with another singing drummer, Jim can only think of {artist: Genesis}' {name: Phil Collins}.

## 00:53:42 DIJ: Jim
{host: Jim}'s **{tag: Desert Island Jukebox}** pick for this week is "{track: Mink Dress}" by {artist: Plasticland}. The song is one of many {genre: psychedelic} tracks found on {album: Children of Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the Second Psychedelic Era—1976-1996}. This {label: Rhino} compilation is one of many Nuggets installments, the first being the two-vinyl set compiled by {name: Lenny Kaye} in {era: 1972}. While there are some gems on the most recent collection, it is pretty much a mess according to {host: Jim}, a huge fan of the psychedelic genre. "{track: Mink Dress}" is one of the standout tracks. Plasticland was started by {name: Glen Rehse} and {name: John Frankovic} in {place: Milwaukee} in the {era: '80s}. Despite their {place: Midwestern} roots, Rehse and Frankovic were drawn to the colorful {era: '60s}-era {genre: British Psychedelia}. Their song follows in the tradition of "{track: Arnold Layne}" by the {name: Syd Barrett}-era {artist: Pink Floyd} and explores the songwriter's fascination with women's clothing—in this case, a mink dress.
