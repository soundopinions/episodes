## 00:00:43 Review: Curtis Harding

![Curtis Harding If Words Were Flowers](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/852/171.jpg)

{artist: Curtis Harding} worked for years as a sideman to {place: Atlanta} artists like {artist: Outkast}, {artist: Black Lips} and {artist: CeeLo Green}. Now his third solo album, {album: If Words Were Flowers}, is turning heads- including Jim and Greg’s.


## 00:07:15 Review: Superchunk

![Superchunk Wild Loneliness](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/852/C34.jpg)

{artist: Superchunk} have been making melodic punk-inspired music for more than 30 years now. {album: Wild Loneliness} is their first album since the politically-charged What A Time To Be Alive in 2018. Musically this album is more buoyant, but the lyrics are still dark and address the most challenging issues facing the real world. 

## 00:14:04 Review: Maren Morris

![Maren Morris Humble Quest](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/852/NG1.jpg)

{artist: Maren Morris} is a pop star thanks to her role in the smash-hit single “{track: The Middle}" and a country star for being one of {artist: The Highwomen}. Her solo albums have sold millions of copies. Her fifth is the new {album: Humble Quest}, and its production from {tag: Greg Kurstin} may be too slick for its own good.


## 00:20:33 Feature: CREEM Magazine
![creem](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2022/creem.jpeg)

{tag: Creem Magazine} personified the idea of a rock and roll magazine, attracting writers like {tag: Lester Bangs} and musicians like {artist: Patti Smith} to their pages. {tag: Jaan Uhelszki} was there in the thick of it and she shares many great stories with Jim and Greg.


## 00:47:23 Feature: Snail Mail
