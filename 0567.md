# Show 567: Bob Mehr on The Replacements & Opinions on Solange

![The Replacements](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2016/replacements_web.jpg)

{artist: The Replacements} never had a hit song, but few bands have inspired such a deep personal connection with their fans. {name: Bob Mehr}, author of the new biography *Trouble Boys*, speaks with {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} about the heartbreaking story and enduring legacy of the {place: Minneapolis} band. Plus, a review of the new album from {artist: Solange} and a look at the sample driving {artist: Drake}'s "{track: Hotline Bling}."

## 00:01:46 Interview: Bob Mehr on The Replacements

![Trouble Boys](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2016/troubleboys_web.jpg)
The mythology of {artist: The Replacements} can overshadow the actual music – from their infamously volatile live shows, to their wild drinking, to {name: Paul Westerberg}'s legendary songwriting genius, and to their commerial ailures. But author {name: Bob Mehr} reveals a more complicated story of the {place: Minneapolis} band in his new book *Trouble Boys: The True Story of The Replacements*. As he explains to {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}, Bob traces much of The Mats' personality to their troubled upbringings, particularly that of guitarist {name: Bob Stinson}. Though the band's records from the early '80s were influenced by {genre: hardcore punk}, Westerberg always had a latent sensitive side that fully emerged on the 1984 masterpiece (and [Classic Album Dissection recipient](http://soundopinions.org/show/97/)) {album: Let It Be}. The Replacements signed to a major label for the 1985 album {album: Tim}, but Bob describes a combination of self-destruction and bad timing that ultimately kept the band off the charts. The Replacements broke up in 1991, but its influence was soon heard all over the {genre: alternative} rock explosion. The enormous crowds at the band's recent reunion shows are testament to the enormous impact the music has had on generations of fans, even if that big hit song always eluded them.

## 00:44:46 Feature: Sample Platter: Drake's "Hotline Bling"
It's time for [another installment](http://soundopinions.org/show/563/#kaleidoscope) of {tag: Sample Platter}, where {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} take a look at a contemporary chart topper that prominently features a unique sample. This week, they analyze {artist: Drake}'s ["{track: Hotline Bling},"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxpDa-c-4Mc) a song first released in July of 2015 and hasn't left the charts since. The main sample in the track is {artist: Timmy Thomas}'s 1972 hit "{track: Why Can't We Live Together}," a song that relies on minimal instrumentation and vocals, driven primarily by a rhythmic organ beat. Jim and Greg discuss how Drake used the Timmy Thomas song to create a new piece of music with a completely different message and vibe.

## 00:50:30 Review: Solange
![A Seat at the Table](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music62/v4/3f/04/9a/3f049ab8-48e3-aa33-290f-b53b761ee99e/source/600x600bb.jpg "927803/1159507212")
Let's just get this part out of the way: {artist: Solange} is the younger sister of {artist: Beyoncé}. But that is where the comparisons end. Solange's new album {album: A Seat at the Table} is her 3rd studio album was produced by the noted {genre: R&B} and {genre: neo-soul} mastermind {name: Raphael Saadiq}. This is a protest album addressing elements of the {tag: Black Lives Matter} movement. While it is an album with a political message {host: Greg} says it is a not a knock-out punch, it is much more subtle with a message of being "weary of the world." While Solange's voice is beautiful and delicate, Greg says her voice is also strong. {host: Jim} also hears Solange's weariness and notes how it contrasts to the anger of sister Beyonce's {album: Lemonade}. {album: A Seat at the Table} gets a double-{tag: Buy It}.
