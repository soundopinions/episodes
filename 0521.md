# Show 521: The 2015 Thanksgiving Turkey Shoot

![2015 Thanksgiving Turkey Shoot](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2015/2015turkeyshoot_web.jpg)

Sometimes we look forward to an artist's new release with great expectations, only to be crushed by the result. In honor of {tag : Thanksgiving}, we present the annual Sound Opinions {tag : Turkey Shoot}, where {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} share the biggest musical disappointments of the year. Later they review the new album from {place : Canadian}  {genre : electronic} artist {artist : Grimes}, and Greg drops a quarter in the {tag : Desert Island Jukebox}.



## 00:02:08 Intro: Music News

![PFSloan](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/521/3K0.jpg)

{artist : P.F. Sloan}, singer and songwriter responsible for the classic {era : 1960s} protest anthem "{track : Eve of Destruction}," died November 15th at his home in {place : Los Angeles}. He was 70 years old. Sloan grew up in {place : New York} and moved to Hollywood as a teen. At 13, he sold his first song and soon became one of the many prominent {place : West Coast} writers of the 1960s. Sloan wrote for such musical giants as {artist : The Turtles}, {artist : Herman's Hermits}, {artist : Fifth Dimension}, {artist : The Searchers}, and {artist : Johnny Rivers}, whose hit, "{track : Secret Agent Man}," was penned by Sloan.

The world of music lost another figure as former {artist : Motörhead} drummer Phil "Philthy Animal" Taylor died November 11th at age 61. {name : [Phil] Taylor} was known for executing double-bass drum tracks with "superhuman speed," and in so doing he helped set the template for the {genre : thrash metal} sound. Taylor joined Motörhead shortly after it was formed in 1975, replacing the original drummer. He played with the band from 1975 to 1984, then again for five years beginning in 1987. He drummed on such hits as "{track : Overkill}" and "{track : Ace of Spades}."



## 00:07:38 List: Turkey Shoot 2015

It's time for the annual Sound Opinions {tag : Thanksgiving Turkey Shoot}! Each year, {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} serve up their biggest musical turkeys of the year with a hefty glob of cranberry sauce. They share the albums that they had high hopes for, but ended up letting them down.

## 00:43:56 Review: Grimes

![Art Angels](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/521/2180.jpg)

{place : Canadian}  {genre : electronic} artist {artist : Grimes} recently released her fourth album called {album : Art Angels}. She came from the underground music scene and rose to popularity with her {era : 2012} album {album : Visions}, and was later signed to {artist : Jay Z}'s management company {tag : Roc Nation}. Although Grimes is a talented singer and multi-instrumentalist, she's best known for the {genre : electronic}  {genre : dream pop} sound that *Art Angels* is full of. At first, {host : Greg} was concerned that Grimes would lose her edge by putting out a more mainstream pop record. However, he is happy to report that *Art Angels* contains some elements of mainstream music but the entire album is done on her terms. Greg gives it a {tag : Buy It}. {host : Jim} agrees; he not only enjoys the sonic components but also the powerful and feminist lyrics. He loves the record most because it's both energizing and fun. An enthusiastic Double {tag : Buy It} for *Art Angels*.



## 00:50:38 DIJ: Greg

In light of recent tragic events in {place : Paris}, this week {host : Greg} wanted to celebrate the music of {place : France} with his {tag : Desert Island Jukebox} selection. He focuses in on French rock band {artist : Mellow}, a group he had a memorable experience watching perform at {tag : SXSW} in the {era : early 2000s}. Even though they have been relatively inactive the past few years, their {era : 1999} album {album : Another Mellow Spring} is their masterpiece. Greg chose the track "{track : Another Mellow Winter}" off the album because of its {genre : psychedelic}, {genre : electronic} and surrealist vibes. It's an epic track that reminds Greg of the power and strength of French music.
