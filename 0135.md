# Show 135: Best of 2008... So Far & Opinions on My Morning Jacket
Jim and Greg love lists so much they can't wait until the end of the year to make them. Tune in to hear their lists for the Best Albums of 2008...So Far. Then stay tuned for their review of the new album from My Morning Jacket.

![2008](http://static.soundopinions.org/images/2008/2008.jpg)

## News: 06.27.08
00:01:45 Dr. {name: Claudius Conrad}, a physician at {tag: Harvard} University Medical School recently conducted a study that examined the relationship between {tag: pain}, healing and {tag: music}. Jim and Greg talk to Dr. Conrad, a classically trained pianist, about his findings, which were published in the journal Critical Care Medicine. He found that playing music for patients recovering in the ICU reduced certain hormone levels that paradoxically caused the lessening of pain symptoms. Dr. Conrad specifically used Mozart in his study, but he believes that any music a patient found pleasurable might have the same effect. He also imagines this would be the case during surgery itself.

## 00:10:26 List: The Best of 2008... So Far
Hard to believe it's almost the midpoint of 2008, but lucky for Sound Opinions listeners, that means it's time for a list! Here are Jim and Greg's lists for 2008's {tag: mid-year best}.

### Jim
1. {artist: Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds}, {album: Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!}
2. {artist: Weezer}, {album: Weezer} ("{tag: The Red Album}")
3. {artist: Local H}, {album: 12 Angry Months}
4. {artist: Gnarls Barkley}, {album: The Odd Couple}
5. {artist: Lupe Fiasco}, {album: The Cool} (Yes, it's arguably a {era: 2007} release. But in its infinite wisdom, {label: Atlantic} officially issued it on Dec. 18 last year, where it was thoroughly lost and quickly forgotten. It's an outstanding effort nonetheless, and I'd argue that it's only really started to make an impact in 2008 as Lupe has toured with {artist: Kanye West}.)
6. {artist: Tim Fite}, {album: Fair Ain't Fair}
7. {artist: Saul Williams}, {album: The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of Niggy Tardust} (Originally issued as a pay-what-you-think-it's-worth download last November; now getting its official CD release on July 8.)
8. {artist: The Black Angels}, {album: Directions to See a Ghost}
9. {artist: Portishead}, {album: Third}
10. {artist: Flight of the Conchords}, {album: Flight of the Conchords}

### Greg
1. {artist: Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds}, "{album: Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!!}"
2. {artist: Portishead}, {album: Third}
3. {artist: Rhymefest}, {album: Man in the Mirror}
4. {artist: Santigold}, {album: Santigold}
5. {artist: Frightened Rabbit}, {album: The Midnight Organ Fight}
6. {artist: Disfear}, {album: Live the Storm}
7. {artist: The Ting Tings}, {album: We Started Nothing}
8. {artist: Alejandro Escovedo}, {album: Real Animal}
9. {artist: Fleet Foxes}, {album: Fleet Foxes}
10. {artist: Lyrics Born}, {album: Everywhere At Once}

## 00:48:08 Review: My Morning Jacket
![Evil Urges](http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/c0/9c/a4/c09ca48f-8952-95d0-d41c-66e933293e57/source/600x600bb.jpg "2322618/282663778")

{artist: My Morning Jacket} has a new album due out this week called {album: Evil Urges}. The band has been hugely successful straddling the line between indie rock and jam band music. As Jim says, "They've been everything to everyone." But now they've given up the "backwoods" setting, and not for the best according to {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}. Both critics hear a ton of experimentation, but nothing that is impressive. Rather, they found themselves asking what My Morning Jacket was thinking. Songs like "{track: Highly Suspicious}" almost seem like a joke. Jim wasn't a big fan before, but he really hates this record and gives it a {tag: Trash It}. Greg wishes there was a rating level below that, but he'll have to settle for {tag: Trash It}.
