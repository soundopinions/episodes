# Show 155: Bubblegum Pop & Opinions on Beyoncé and The Knux

With the explosion of acts like the {artist : Jonas Brothers} and {artist : Miley Cyrus}, it's time to take a look at the musical genre that has had teens screaming for over half a century: {genre : Bubblegum Pop}.

## 00:01:49 Intro: Music News

A glance at the numbers coming out of the traditional music industry institutions don't paint a pretty picture. But, as {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} explain, for everyone outside the major labels and distributors, {era : 2008} hasn't actually been such a bad year. {tag : Apple} is reporting a 34% increase in sales. This includes {tag : iTunes} downloads as well as players and accessories, but compare these stats with the 20% dip the record companies are reporting, and you get even more proof that the old model needs tweaking.

There's another surprising news item coming out of the digital music realm. If you had asked Jim and Greg years ago to bet on what artist would dominate digital music sales today, they would never have guessed {artist : Journey}. The power balladeers' {era : 1981} hit "{track : Don't Stop Believin}" just became top selling catalog track in {tag : iTunes} history with over 2 million downloads. How did this song eclipse heavy hitters like "{track : Sweet Home Alabama}" and "{track : Bohemian Rhapsody}?" Greg attributes the song's late blooming success to 3 things: its association with the {place : Chicago}  {tag : White Sox}, its use in the {tag : Sopranos}' finale, and its use during {artist : Kanye West}'s most recent tour. Jim would prefer to never have to hear from {artist : Journey} again, but Greg will defend the song's catchiness, particularly that unforgettable keyboard riff.

In sadder news, {place : South Africa}n singer {artist : Miriam Makeba} died last week at the age of 76. Greg says that Makeba is to South Africa what {artist : Edith Piaf}, {artist : Mahalia Jackson} and {artist : Celia Cruz} are to their home countries. Her passion for South Africa and for all of the continent mirrored her voice and her music, and in the case of her recording contract, jeopardized it. Makeba is best remembered through the conviction you can hear in songs, so Jim and Greg play the updated version of "{track : Pata Pata}" from her 2000 album {album : Homeland}.



## 00:11:09 Special: Bubblegum Pop

{genre : Bubblegum Pop} acts like {artist : Miley Cyrus} and {artist : The Jonas Brothers} are all the rage now, but a look back at the history of {genre : rock} shows that teen and tween-oriented acts have always dominated the charts. Ever since music executives discovered how successful you could be marketing to kids, they have been manufacturing Bubblegum Pop acts for each new generation. But while not all of these teen idols can claim to be artists, many produced terrific, upbeat, well-crafted songs. Here are some of {host : Jim} and {host : Greg}'s favorites:

- {artist : Ricky Nelson}
- {artist : 1910 Fruitgum Company}
- {artist : Ohio Express}
- {artist : The Archies}
- {artist : The Banana Splits}
- {artist : Jackson 5}
- {artist : New Edition}
- {artist : Boys II Men}
- {artist : Backstreet Boys}
- {artist : Justin Timberlake}
- {artist : Naked Brothers}
- {artist : Hilary Duff}



## 00:43:13 Review: Beyonce

![I Am... Sasha Fierce](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/155/2010.jpg)

{artist : Beyonce} and her alter-ego have a new album out called {album : I Am...Sasha Fierce}. The album contains two discs, one comprised of ballads (the {artist : Beyonce} side) and one comprised of funkier, up-tempo tracks (the Sasha Fierce side). Greg explains that Beyonce has reinvented being an {genre : R&B} diva in the 21st century by putting the emphasis on songs. But, that's where this release falls through for him. The songs are not as strong, and he doesn't buy the Sasha Fierce attitude. For {host : Greg} this is a {tag : Trash It}. Jim couldn't disagree more. He thought the ballad side had surprising range. Another pleasant surprise was Beyonce's take on {genre : europop}  {genre : dance} music. The second disc is full of great party tracks, and {host : Jim} recommends listeners {tag : Buy It}.



## 00:49:50 Review: The Knux

![Remind Me In 3 Days...](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/155/2B20.jpg)

{artist : The Knux} is a {genre : hip-hop} brother act originally from {place : New Orleans}. Their new album {album : Remind Me in 3 Days} follows the release of a successful {tag : MySpace} hit "{track : Cappuccino}." {host : Jim} admits that they aren't the greatest of rappers, but he was blown away by their enthusiasm. That enthusiasm extends to the inventive production as well. {host : Greg} agrees, calling the duo "audacious." But he notes that while they bring in lots of reference points, they are completely unpolished in a refreshing way. Both critics give The Knux debut a {tag : Buy It} rating.
