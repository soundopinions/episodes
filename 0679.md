# Show 679: Singer-Songwriter Amanda Shires & Opinions on Anderson .Paak & Art Brut

![Amanda](https://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2018/amanda_shires.jpg)

This week, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} have a conversation with {genre: country} {genre: singer-songwriter} {artist: Amanda Shires} at the {place: Goose Island Tap Room} in {place: Chicago}. They discuss her literary lyrics, her latest album {album: To The Sunset} and how becoming a mom has influenced her art. She'll also perform live. Jim and Greg will also review new albums from {genre: hip hop} artist {artist: Anderson .Paak} and {genre: indie rock} band {artist: Art Brut}.


## 00:01:27 Review: Anderson .Paak
![Anderson](https://sound-images.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2018/oxnard.jpg)
{tag: Singer}, {tag: rapper}, and {tag: drummer} {artist: Anderson .Paak} stole the hearts of critics and fans alike with his debut solo album, {album: Malibu}, in 2016. But, {host: Greg} argues that his half dozen features on {artist: Dr. Dre}'s 2015 album {album: Compton} initially put .Paak on the map for many listeners. Dr. Dre returns the favor here, producing {album: Oxnard}: Anderson's ode to his hometown of {place: Oxnard}, California. Both Greg and Jim agree that the production shines here, and {host: Jim} is happy that the sound returns to the groovy, old-school roots of {place: West Coast} {genre: G-Funk}. He thinks the album has a "wonderful, sunny vibe"; but, {album: Oxnard} is ulimately "a letdown." According to Jim, tracks like "{track: 6 Summers}" sum up "everything that's wrong with the record." He laments that lyrically, .Paak has "nothing to say" and can't decide whether he wants to be a "mack daddy" or "woke." Greg complicates that idea, noting that the conflictedness of the album reflects .Paak's upbringing: he was raised in church in a community surrounded by a darker street element. They both agree that the record loses steam by the end, and that it's propped up by big-name cameos from rappers like {artist: Kendrick Lamar} and {artist: Q-Tip}. Greg adds that .Paak is a better artist than that and should be making records that don't need those kind of crutches."

## 00:07:32 Review: Art Brut
![Wham! Bang! Pow! Let's Rock Out! - Single](https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music128/v4/10/72/d7/1072d7bb-34ff-2757-d131-9cc70aa692a1/source/600x600bb.jpg "20232686/1414901961")
On their fifth album, {album: Wham! Bang! Pow! Let's Rock Out!}, {genre: post punk} band {artist: Art Brut} continues to rise and fall on the strength of singer {name: Eddie Argos}'s self-deprecating lyrics. Working in the tradition of {artist: Jonathan Richman} and {artist: The Modern Lovers}, Argos speak-sings self aware songs full of music nerd references about his own modest music career. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} were both huge fans of their 2005 debut album {album: Bang Bang Rock & Roll}, but their follow up albums never improved on that album's formula. Greg doesn't find much new on {album: Wham! Bang!...} other than some horn arrangements, but declares his undying love for Eddie Argos' persona. Jim, however, finds the new album interesting for turning to a new category of {genre: rock} cliches to subvert. Instead of "a poor schlub who wants to be in a band but has no talent," Argos now depicts a sadder figure: "a poor middle-aged schlub who was in a band, but has no talent." He finds it sadder and more effective than ever.

## 00:14:33 Interview: Amanda Shires
This week, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} talk to {genre: singer-songwriter} and violinist {artist: Amanda Shires} at the {tag: Goose Island Tap Room} in {place: Chicago}. Amanda released her latest solo album {album: To The Sunset} in early August of this year to a lot of critical acclaim, especially for the intricately beautiful lyrics and genre-blending on the record ({genre: country}, {genre: rock}, {genre: acoustic}, etc.) Shires talks with Jim and Greg about her time in the legendary {artist: Bob Wills} band {artist: The Texas Playboys} and about how getting her MFA in poetry elevated her lyricism. They also discuss her husband, singer, guitarist and songwriter {artist: Jason Isbell}, and how becoming a mom changed her musical perspective. Shires also brought along her long fiddle and her guitar player and performs a special stripped down set.
