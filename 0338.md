## 00:01:45 News: 5.18.12
{tag: Live Nation}/{tag: Ticketmaster}'s practice of reselling, or scalping, its own tickets on the website {tag: TicketsNow} drew a lot of negative attention from the likes of {artist: Bruce Springsteen} and the {tag: New Jersey Attorney General}. The company agreed to stop linking and limit advertising for TicketsNow as part of a 2009 settlement, but now they've quietly begun resuming linking. They are trying to be more transparent, but it looks like the secondary ticket market isn't going away anytime soon.

In an effort to take matters into its own hands, the jam band {artist: String Cheese Incident} is taking a novel approach to spare its fans from paying {tag: Ticketmaster}'s loathed service charges. Fans and friends recently brought $20,000 in cash to the {place: Greek Theater} in {place: Los Angeles} and purchased tickets to the String Cheese show. They then brought the almost 400 tickets by hand to the group's headquarters in {place: Colorado} where they went on sale again, sans extra fees. Robin Hood would certainly approve.

One of the great all-time {tag: bass players}, {artist: Donald "Duck" Dunn}, died this week at age 70. Along with high school friend {name: Steve Cropper}, Dunn was part of one of rock's best rhythm sections. As a member of {artist: Booker T. and the MGs}, he played alongside legendary {label: Stax} acts like {artist: Sam and Dave}, {artist: Wilson Pickett} and {artist: Otis Redding}. He later worked with everyone from {artist: Bob Dylan} to {artist: Eddie Floyd}. To remember Dunn's trademark concision and swing, Jim and Greg play "{track: Knock on Wood}" by Eddie Floyd.

## 00:08:01 Interview: James Mercer

You're in a beloved band at the height of success. Natalie Portman tells the world that your band will change lives. So what do you do? Blow everything up, of course. At least you do if you're {name: James Mercer}. {artist: The Shins} frontman and founder followed up his {tag: Grammy nominated}, {tag: Billboard} charting album {album: Wincing the Night Away} with a decision to completely change the group's lineup and sound. He sought out {tag: producer} {name: Greg Kurstin}, best known for working with {artist: Lily Allen} and {artist: Kesha}, and the result is {album: Port of Morrow}. As he discusses with Jim and Greg, this transition wasn't easy, but was necessary. And it's not the first time Mercer made an unexpected collaboration. He and {name: Danger Mouse} (of Grey Album fame) joined together for {artist: Broken Bells}. Check out video of Mercer performing songs from the album, as well as an oldie, but goodie.

## 00:49:25 Review: Norah Jones
![...Little Broken Hearts](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/338/2AD0.jpg)

{artist: Norah Jones} also teamed up with {name: Danger Mouse} for her 5th album called {album: ...Little Broken Hearts}. She's sold 40 million albums, won a ton of Grammys, and gained fans with her jazzy, laid back vocals. But it's too laid back for Jim's taste. He accuses Jones of bringing Danger Mouse down, and is irritated by her utter lack of passion. Unless you are looking to doze, {tag: Trash it}. Greg understands {host: Jim} wants Jones to shout, but that's never been her thing. And subtlety is undervalued these days. Not everything works well, but {host: Greg} finds Little Broken Hearts a nice left turn and says {tag: Burn It}.
