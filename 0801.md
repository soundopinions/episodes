![dawnie](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2021/dawniemerry_medium.jpeg)

Black women haven't been celebrated enough in rock music. Author Dawnie Walton talks with hosts Jim DeRogatis and Greg Kot about how that inspired her debut novel, The Final Revival of Opal and Nev, a fantasy rock history about a fierce black singer in the 1970s. Plus Jim and Greg talk with Merry Clayton, whose iconic performance on "Gimme Shelter" still didn't make her a household name.
