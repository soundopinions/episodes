## 00:01:49 News: 11.15.2013
For years the record industry has been going after people violating copyright through piracy. But now, lyrics are under fire. The {tag: National Music Publishers' Association} (NMPA) has sent a number of [takedown](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/12/business/media/in-music-piracy-battles-lyrics-demand-respect-too.html) notices to websites who put up song lyrics without permission. *Lyrics Mania* and {tag: *Rap Genius*} are among those targeted.

{name: Colonel Tom Parker} knew that {artist: Elvis Presley}'s death wouldn't mean the end of Elvis Presley, Inc. And the [big business](http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5785656/michael-jacksons-touring-life-after-death-the-billboard-cover-story) of death continues with {artist: Michael Jackson}. Even without the superstar's presence, the {tag: *Cirque du Soleil*} production, "{tag: Michael Jackson: The Immortal World Tour}," recently became the number nine top-grossing tour of all time, earning $325.1 million.


## 00:06:51 List: Turkey Shoot

## 00:43:09 Review: Lady Gaga
![ARTPOP](//static.soundopinions.org/assets/416/1ZX0.jpg "277293880/728777841")
"Anti-diva" {artist: Lady Gaga} has just released her third album, {album: Artpop}. and it's headed for #1. The title is a brazen declaration of its content, but after a few plays, neither Jim nor {host: Greg} feel much like the album is "Art" at all. While {host: Jim} does [think](http://www.wbez.org/blogs/jim-derogatis/2013-11/rimshots-lady-gagas-art-poop-and-eminems-flashback-109149) the music is still as groovy as ever, he can't get over the pandering, nonsensical lyrics., especially considering her attempts to empower [her fans](https://littlemonsters.com/). So, Jim says {tag: Burn It}. Greg refuses to step over the threshold, [explaining](http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/turnitup/chi-lady-gaga-artpop-review-20131108-17,0,2080724.column) that the music underwhelms with conventional, risk-averse {genre: EDM} courtesy of big name {tag: producer}s like {name: DJ White Shadow}. Lady Gaga has built a career out of twisting the formula, but Greg doesn't hear any reinvention: {tag: Trash It}. 

## 00:50:44 DIJ: Jim
Recently Jim's better half was watching {tag: VH1} promos of the new {artist: TLC} biopic. It got him thinking about better {genre: R&B} and {genre: hip hop} groups from the {era: '90s} like Salt-N-Pepa and En Vogue. The two came together in 1993 for "{track: Whatta Man}." To Jim, this is a girl group sound at its best—with {artist: En Vogue}'s "perfect" choruses and {artist: Salt-N-Pepa}'s witty verses over a sample of {artist: Linda Lyndell}'s original 1968 [hit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNojyNeK3FY)  {host: Jim} wants this funky tribute to "a God-sent original, the man of my dreams" on his Desert Island Jukebox.
