# Show 688: Weird Instruments of Rock, Opinions on Maggie Rogers & Sharon Van Etten

![theremin](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2019/theremin.jpg)

Forget about the {tag: guitar}, {tag: bass}, and {tag: drums}. This week, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} explore some of the weirder instruments of rock from the {tag: theremin} to the {tag: ocarina} to the {tag: cowbell}. They'll also review new music from two {genre: singer-songwriter}s: the debut album from {artist: Maggie Rogers} and the latest from {artist: Sharon Van Etten}.

## 00:01:41 Review: Maggie Rogers
![Maggie](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2019/maggie.jpg)

{genre: Singer-songwriter} {artist: Maggie Rogers} caught the ear of super producer {artist: Pharrell Williams} while she was still a student at NYU. [Video of her playing her song, "{track: Alaska}" for Williams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAM1N1APk80), and his emotional reaction, went viral in 2016, putting Maggie on many listeners' radars. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} hoped that her new album, {album: Heard It in a Past Life}, would have more of the unique blend of {genre: folk} and {genre: electronic} beats that "Alaska" offered, but Greg laments that the album's heavy handed big label production by the likes of {artist: Greg Kursten} and {artist: Ricky Reed} is like "putting extra icing on a cake that's already perfect." A highlight for Greg is the introspective "{track: Past Life}" because it's just Maggie accompanied by the piano "and the producers don't screw it up." Jim goes one step further, adding that he thinks the record "is all icing." He cannot relate to the album sonically, or to the album's message. 

## 00:08:05 Review: Sharon Van Etten
![sharon](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2019/sharon.jpg)

{album: Remind Me Tomorrow} is {artist: Sharon Van Etten}'s fifth official album and first in nearly five years. Since her debut in 2009, Van Etten's profile had steadily grown until she essentially walked away from her recording career after 2014's {album: Are We There}. Instead she went to college hoping to become a mental health counselor, started a romantic relationship with drummer {name: Zeke Hutchins}, acted in the Netflix show {tag: The OA} and gave birth to a son. Loyal fans didn't lose hope, though. One even made [a t-shirt asking when Van Etten would record a new album.](https://www.facebook.com/SharonVanEttenMusic/photos/a.144993022227107/1952838534775871/?type=1&theater) When she started work on the new album, instead of featuring {tag: guitar} or {tag: piano} as she has in the past, Van Etten built her sound around the {tag: Roland Jupiter 4} synthesizer. {host: Greg} says you might have heard that instrument on a {artist: Spandau Ballet} album, while {host: Jim} calls it the "Farfisa trash organ of synths." They both praise Van Etten's newly reimagined sound. Greg calls the sonics her "boldest touch here." He says the connection between the creepy sounds and very astute lyrics and melodies indicate that Van Etten may be getting even better as an artist. Jim likens the album to {artist: Radiohead}'s {album: Kid A} in that it expresses uncertainty in the outside world and how it encroaches on personal life and self expression through art. 

## 00:16:30 List: Weird Instruments of Rock

Since its earliest days, rock music has been dominated by guitar, bass, and drums. But, as {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} reveal in this episode, sometimes it's the more {tag: unusual instruments} (aka {tag: weird instruments}) that really make a song. They play their favorite tracks featuring non-traditional rock instruments.

![Alan R. Pearlman](//static.soundopinions.org/images/2019/ARP.jpg)

{host: Jim} pays tribute to the late {name: Alan Robert Pearlman}, inventor of the {tag: ARP synthesizer}, who died in January at age 93. Before founding his synthesizer company in 1969, Pearlman worked for {tag: NASA} designing amplifiers to be used on Gemini and Apollo spacecraft. In a nod to this aspect of his life, Jim plays "{track: Space Truckin'}" by {artist: Deep Purple} in memory of Pearlman, a song Jim says is basically about "how cool it would be to be high in space." The version on Deep Purple's 1972 live album, {album: Made in Japan} is almost 20 minutes long and features a wicked ARP solo by {name: Jon Lord}.
