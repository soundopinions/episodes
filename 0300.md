## 00:01:51 Intro: Music News
We're going to be honest. Deaths in the musical world are a mixed bag. On one hand, you're sad about the loss of a great figure and sad for their friends and family. But on the other hand, sometimes it takes a loss to make you stop and reconsider that person's contributions. This week {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} look back at two wonderful {tag: songwriters} that died on Monday: {name: Jerry Leiber} and {name: Nick Ashford}. Leiber is best known as one half of the duo {tag: Leiber & Stoller}. Ashford, too, was in a duo with his wife {name: Valerie Simpson}. Leiber wrote lyrics for a number of hits in the {era: 1950's} and {era: 1960's} including "{track: Stand By Me}" and "{track: Hound Dog}," though not originally for {artist: Elvis [Presley]}. Ashford & Simpson penned the tunes "{track: Ain't No Mountain High Enough}," "{track: Let's Go Get Stoned}," and their own hit "{track: Solid}." Greg particularly likes the song "{track: California Soul}" by {artist: Marlena Shaw}.

## 00:08:42 Classic Album Dissection: Rust Never Sleeps

For our 300th episode, Jim and Greg wanted to do a {tag: Classic Album Dissection} of one of their favorite records of all time: {album: Rust Never Sleeps} by {artist: Neil Young}. The {era: 1979} release was mostly recorded live during Young's {era: 1978} tour, save some overdubs. As {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} discuss, it was in large part a response to the emerging {genre: punk} music. How does a {genre: classic rock}er from the {era: '60s} grow and evolve? This is how. As Young sings in "{track: My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)}," "{track: It's better to burn out, than to fade away}."

That song bookends the album, with the middle tracks broken into an acoustic section and an electric one. Jim remarks how brave it was for Young to come out with nothing but an acoustic guitar. He particularly loves the song "{track: Pocahontas}," which makes reference to the Native American icon in addition to the Hollywood icon {name: Marlon Brando}. Greg chooses to highlight the hard-stomping electric "{track: Powderfinger}," which attempts to reconcile America's complicated identity. 

## 00:48:57 Review: Stephen Malkmus

{artist: Pavement} fans eagerly awaited the band's 2010 {tag: reunion}. And {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} think they'll be happy to hear {artist: Stephen Malkmus}' new solo effort {album: Mirror Traffic}, as well. It's a return to form in many ways. You'll hear that signature smirk, the short, bursting pop songs and the quizzical lyrics. It was {tag: produced} by fellow {genre: alt-rock} idol {name: Beck}, and despite {name: [Stephen] Malkmus}' "slacker" rep, there's a great deal of {genre: pop} craftsmenship on the album. Both hosts say {tag: Buy It}.
