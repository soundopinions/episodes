![disco](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2018/disco.jpg)

For decades, people have maligned {genre : disco} music. This week, {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} take an in-depth look at the genre from its origins in marginalized communities to its height of popularity. They'll also explore groundbreaking artists like {artist : Sylvester}, the {artist : Bee Gees} and more. Also, Greg talks to {label : Sire Records} co-founder {name : Seymour Stein} about signing acts like the {artist : Ramones} and {artist : Madonna}.



## 00:01:34 Interview: Seymour Stein

![stein](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/668/2M0.jpg)

{name : Seymour Stein} is a living legend in the music industry: Breaking into the record business when he was only a teenager, Stein co-founded his own label, {label : Sire Records}, in 1966. Sire went on to sign superstars like {artist : Madonna} and bring musical movements like {genre : new wave} and {genre : West Coast hip-hop} to a wider audience. Earlier this summer, Stein announced his departure from Sire and {label : Warner Bros.} and released a tell-all memoir. {host : Greg} revisits his 2015 conversation with Stein in front of a live audience at the {place : Hard Rock Hotel} in {place : Chicago}, under the auspices of the {tag : Lake FX Summit + Expo}.

Boasting one-of-a-kind artists like the gender-bending {artist : Sylvester} to the expansively creative {artist : Donna Summer}, {genre : disco} is sorely underrated. At least, that's what {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} argue in their retrospective of the genre. Disco did more than give us catchy, dance-ready tunes: it championed marginalized voices, especially those in the {tag : Black} and {tag : LGBTQ} communities. Jim and Greg outline major moments for the genre, from its {genre : R&B} roots, to the infamous {tag : Disco Demolition} night in {place : Chicago}, to its influence on genres to come.
