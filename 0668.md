![disco](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2018/disco.jpg)

For decades, people have maligned {genre: disco} music. This week, {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} take an in-depth look at the genre from its origins in marginalized communities to its height of popularity. They'll also explore groundbreaking artists like {artist: Sylvester}, the {artist: Bee Gees} and more. Also, Greg talks to {label: Sire Records} co-founder {name: Seymour Stein} about signing acts like the {artist: Ramones} and {artist: Madonna}.


## 00:01:34 Interview: Seymour Stein
![stein](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/668/2M0.jpg)
{name: Seymour Stein} is a living legend in the music industry: Breaking into the record business when he was only a teenager, Stein co-founded his own label, {label: Sire Records}, in 1966. Sire went on to sign superstars like {artist: Madonna} and bring musical movements like {genre: new wave} and {genre: West Coast hip-hop} to a wider audience. Earlier this summer, Stein announced his departure from Sire and {label: Warner Bros.} and released a tell-all memoir. {host: Greg} revisits his 2015 conversation with Stein in front of a live audience at the {place: Hard Rock Hotel} in {place: Chicago}, under the auspices of the {tag: Lake FX Summit + Expo}.

Boasting one-of-a-kind artists like the gender-bending {artist: Sylvester} to the expansively creative {artist: Donna Summer}, {genre: disco} is sorely underrated. At least, that's what {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} argue in their retrospective of the genre. Disco did more than give us catchy, dance-ready tunes: it championed marginalized voices, especially those in the {tag: Black} and {tag: LGBTQ} communities. Jim and Greg outline major moments for the genre, from its {genre: R&B} roots, to the infamous {tag: Disco Demolition} night in {place: Chicago}, to its influence on genres to come.
