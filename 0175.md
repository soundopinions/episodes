## 00:04:32 News: 04.03.09
After years of offering music for 99 cents, {tag: iTunes} will be launching its variable pricing plan next week. That means that hit songs will soon be sold for $1.29, and some older tracks will go for $0.69. This is good news for the labels, who see the billion dollar digital music industry as a lifesaver. But, it's not certain how consumers will react.

In other digital music news. {tag: Google} will now be offering free downloads of licensed music files in {place: China}. Right now 99% of all music tracks distributed in China are pirated, so this is a huge market for Google to tap. Their revenue will come from ads on the music site-revenue they will share with the labels.

{tag: Blender Magazine} has just published its last issue, leaving only three major music magazines. {host: Jim} isn't happy to hear of any music magazine folding, but he for one will not be mourning the loss of Blender. Jim felt the magazine was often sexist and lowest common denominator. {host: Greg} was impressed with the writing talent they pooled, but doesn't think anyone, even the best writers, can do much under 150 words. He wishes there were more music magazines that valued long-form journalism.

## 00:10:07 Interview: Blitzen Trapper
A few weeks ago {host: Greg} recommend our Rock Doctors patients check out {album: Furr} by {artist: Blitzen Trapper}. Now we have the band live in our studio for a conversation and acoustic performance. The {place: Portland} {genre: indie rock} band, led by {name: Eric Earley}, has been gaining momentum after touring with {label: Sub Pop} label mate {artist: Fleet Foxes}. Blitzen Trapper's music is often compared to {genre: classic American rock} of the {era: late '60s} and {era: early '70s}. But as Earley explains, every musician is influenced by the past. And despite a familiar sound, there's still a sense of mystery and originality. You can hear it in the songs the band performs live in our studio.

## 00:41:35 Review: PJ Harvey and John Parish

{artist: PJ Harvey} has a new album out with longtime collaborator {artist: John Parish} called {album: A Woman A Man Walked By}. {name: John Parish} was like a mentor to {name: Polly Jean [Harvey]} when she was starting out, and as Jim and Greg explain, that relationship allows her to feel comfortable enough to really let loose. {host: Greg} wishes there was more consistency to the songwriting, though. For him some of the tracks are nothing but experimentation. He gives the album a {tag: Burn It}. {host: Jim} is shocked and describes {artist: A Woman A Man Walked By} as PJ having fun. He predicts a mid-life career surge and gives the record a {tag: Buy It} rating.
