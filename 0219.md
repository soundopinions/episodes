## 00:01:45 News: 2.5.2010
Last week {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} endured what is always a career low-point for them: the multi-hour {tag: Grammy} broadcast. While they are all in favor of honoring artistic achievement, Jim and Greg explain that the Grammys only presented 9 actual awards last week. For the most part, it's a show of celebrity spectacle, and one that rakes in big ratings. Of the winners, {artist: Beyonce} took the most awards home. But, she lost {tag: Album of the Year} to newcomer {artist: Taylor Swift}. Jim and Greg wouldn't fight for any of the nominees to win, and instead point to the {tag: *Village Voice Pazz and Jop*} poll as a better measure of the year's {tag: best albums}.

Despite winning Album of the Year and having the top-selling album of 2009, {artist: Taylor Swift} hasn't gotten a lot of Sound Opinions airtime. Jim and Greg give a quick listen to {album: Fearless} to see if it's worth the hype. Jim isn't sure she's the most interesting role-model for teenage girls, and doesn't think she'd have such acclaim if she wasn't quite the looker. But, Greg hears a lot of relatable content on her album. He thinks she could develop into a credible artist, but for now she's just a tween, not a queen.

Last week Jim and Greg reported on the {tag: merger} between {tag: Live Nation} and {tag: Ticketmaster}. This week they check in with {name: Seth Hurwitz}, one of the country's leading {tag: independent promoters} and owner of the {place: 9:30 Club} in {place: Washington D.C.} Hurwitz testified at the {tag: Senate hearings} on the merger last year and expressed concern over lack of competition in the industry. Now his concerns are reality. As he explains to {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}, the agreement's monopoly firewalls provide no consolation. And while Hurwitz feels secure in his business for the time being, he's worried about a time when Live Nation/Ticketmaster scoops up all of the mid-level acts that have so far avoided corporate arenas. He also warns about major ticket price increases.

## 00:21:45 Rock Doctors: Valentine's Day Emergency
Jim and Greg open up the {tag: Rock Doctors}' clinic for the next segment. They take an appointment with two listeners for a {tag: Valentine's Day} emergency. {name: Andrew} and {name: Kelli} are a young couple from {place: Chicago} with only one major relationship problem: music. While Andrew is music obsessive, always on the search for something new and underground, Kelli is happy sticking with her favorite radio favorites. And as Andrew points out, for the most part his girlfriend's music is stuck in that dreaded decade: the {era: 70s}. Kelli admits to a fondness for bar music like {artist: Boston}, {artist: Styx} and {artist: Journey}, but is open to new stuff as long as it's upbeat and fun. She finds a lot of her boyfriend's tastes ({artist: Wilco}, {artist: Radiohead}) to be too cerebral and boring. So, it's Jim and Greg's task to find something they will both enjoy.

Greg prescribes {album: The Latest} by {artist: Cheap Trick}. He knows a lot of people dismiss this band for being cheesy, but he stands behind their smart lyrics, progressive compositions and terrific drumming. It seems like The Latest should be the perfect remedy, however neither Andrew nor Kelli are tremendously fond of it. Surprisingly, this record is even too cheesy for Kelli. And while Andrew admires the band for rocking out so hard for so long, he won't be attending any Cheap Trick shows anytime soon.

Jim prescribes the self-titled debut by {artist: La Roux}. He loves the British duo's smart electronic pop. Jim didn't see anything like {album: La Roux} on either Kelli or Andrew's chart, but thinks radical treatment is necessary. He's right; the couple loves the record. Kelli got her dose of dance music, and Andrew got his artiness. And they won't have to break-up over rock anytime soon.

## 00:47:23 Review: Sade
![Soldier of Love](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/ed/67/a6/ed67a6df-2dad-a597-0cd2-b138100a9edf/source/600x600bb.jpg "475591/349971711")
This week's review is another possible prescription. What couple wouldn't like a romantic dose of {artist: Sade}? The Nigerian-British singer is back with her first album in a decade. Most people associate Sade with that smooth {genre: R&B} sound of the {era: 80s}. Now she's created a smooth R&B sound for the {era: 10s}. As {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} discuss, {album: Soldier of Love} is not a radical departure. But Sade still sounds great, and has brought her complicated and compelling life stories into her music. It's a welcome return for both critics and a double {tag: Buy It}.
