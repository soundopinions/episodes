# Show 442: Uncle Tupelo's No Depression and Opinions on Black Keys & Lykke Li

![No Depression](http://static.soundopinions.org/images/2014/nodepression_web.jpg)
With its innovative fusion of traditional {genre: folk} and {genre: country} with {genre: punk} and {genre: rock 'n' roll}, {artist: Uncle Tupelo}'s {album: No Depression} is a genuine milestone in American music, inspiring countless bands and defining what we today call alt-country. Jim and Greg talk to Uncle Tupelo's drummer {name: Mike Heidorn} about the 1990 release and its recent reissue. Later, they review new records by Swedish singer {artist: Lykke Li} and American rockers {artist: The Black Keys}.

## 00:02:08 News: 05.16.2014 
The song contest/political science experiment called {tag: Eurovision} took place on Saturday. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} have been looking forward to the weird and wonderful phenomenon since [speaking](/show/438/) with expert {name: John Kennedy O'Connor} last month—and Eurovision {era: 2014} did not disappoint. This year's prize went to "{track: Rise Like a Phoenix}," a power ballad belted by {place: Austria}n diva {artist: Conchita Wurst}, the {tag: drag} persona of Mr. {name: Thomas Neuwirth}. But the real star of the evening? {tag: Politics}. Though some considered Wurst's win a victory for tolerance, it outraged conservatives in countries like {place: Russia} and {place: Belarus}. Meanwhile, Russia and {place: Ukraine} turned the conflict over {place: Crimea} into a fight for the spotlight, and the audience showed disdain for {name: [Vladimir] Putin} by booing the Russian act. Americans may not "get" Eurovision, but 180 million viewers can't be all wrong…

In other bizarre international news is a story from the {tag: New York Times}. Apparently the people of {place: China} have gotten used to saying "goodbye"—or, more to the point, "get out!"—to the dulcet tones of one {artist: Kenny G}. All across China, the elevator {genre: jazz} giant's {era: 1989} hit "{track: Going Home}" is played at malls, gyms, libraries, and even wedding banquets to signal the day's end. Many don't know the song's name, but they know to pack up and leave once it starts playing. And while China's non-existent {tag: royalty} policy means that the sax-man makes very little off his ubiquitous tune, {name: Kenny [G]} has taken it in stride, joking that at Chinese concerts, he plays "Going Home" last to keep people from leaving early. {host: Greg} thinks that China has managed some impressive social engineering—almost Pavlovian, says {host: Jim}. But our hosts can sympathize: Hearing Kenny G makes them evacuate the premises, too.


## 00:06:39 Interview: Mike Heidorn of Uncle Tupelo
You can trace {genre: alternative country}'s roots to the {era: 1960's} when rock musicians such as {artist: Gram Parsons}, {artist: The Byrds} and the {artist: Flatlanders} began dabbling with and reinvigorating {genre: country} music. It was part of a wider investigation of {place: America}n roots music in {genre: rock}, a move toward more "authentic" styles. These rockers looked to country greats like {artist: Hank Williams}, {artist: The Carter Family}, {artist: Johnny Cash} and {artist: Merle Haggard} for inspiration -- {artist: Bob Dylan} famously collaborated with Cash on "{track: Girl From the North Country}." In the {era: '70s} and early {era: '80s}, a new generation of {genre: punk} rockers started digging into traditional country for inspiration, including {artist: X}, {artist: The Mekons}, {artist: Rank & File}, {artist: Jason and the Scorchers} and the {artist: Long Ryders}. Then third wave of alt country hit in the late {era: '80s} and early {era: '90s}, led by {artist: The Jayhawks} out of {place: Minneapolis} and {artist: Uncle Tupelo}, the trio of {name: Jay Farrar}, {name: Jeff Tweedy} and {name: Mike Heidorn}, out of {place: Belleville, Illinois}, just outside {place: St. Louis}. Uncle Tupelo's debut album, "No Depression," took its name from a {artist: Carter Family} song, "{track: No Depression in Heaven,}" and it's one of many the key albums in defining the {genre: alt-country} movement of this era. We have this band to thank for groups like Farrar's {artist: Son Volt}, Tweedy's {artist: Wilco}, {name: Ryan Adams}' {artist: Whiskeytown}, the {artist: Drive-By-Truckers} and the {artist: Old 97's} …and not to mention {tag:* No Depression Magazine*}. {label: Legacy Recordings} recently reissued {album: No Depression}, complete with some never before released demo tracks from 1987 to 1989. And to talk about it, Jim and Greg are joined by Uncle Tupelo's founding drummer {name: Mike Heidorn}. 

## 00:42:06 Review: The Black Keys
![Turn Blue](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/45/46/30/4546301e-c493-242b-68b7-79ae0c0dbf93/source/600x600bb.jpg "5893059/841098321")
{artist: The Black Keys} have grown from an underground band from {place: Akron, Ohio} to an act filling arenas across the country. The sound has changed as well. On {album: Turn Blue}, {artist: Dan Auerbach} and {artist: Patrick Carney} have evolved from a {artist: Zeppellin}-esque blues stomp to something more nuanced, orchestrated and keyboard-based. {host: Jim} thinks the band is mainly successful when it channels {genre: psychedelic blues}. But, he wants more stomp and says {tag: Try It} rating. {host: Greg} is even less enthusiastic about {album: Turn Blue} and thinks that some of the experimentation is "half-baked." Still, he likes the high points, and there are enough of them to warrant a {tag: Try It} rating, as well.

## 00:48:30 Review: Lykke Li
![I Never Learn](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/02/7a/bd/027abd19-0575-429e-e68e-a0989e9ea9f7/source/600x600bb.jpg "263435943/839186333")
Swedish singer/songwriter {artist: Lykke Li} blends acoustic rock with electronic elements and heartfelt lyrics. Her latest album, {album: I Never Learn}, was eagerly anticipated by Jim and Greg, as both were fans of her [last release](/show/279/#woundedrhymes) {album: Wounded Rhymes}. {host: Jim} thinks this latest effort is just short of a masterpiece. He's particularly drawn to the juxtaposition of the emotional lyrics and the spare arrangements. {tag: Buy It}, he says. {host: Greg} is as so spellbound. He's let down by {artist: Lykke Li}'s lyrics and wishes she went back to a slightly more orchestrated style to mask her discomfort with English. He gives the record a {tag: Try It} rating.
