## 00:02:11 Interview: Bob Mould

Throughout his storied career, songwriter and guitarist {artist : Bob Mould} seems to be driven by the mystical power of the number 3. He's best known for his work with a couple of power trios: the pioneering {place : Minneapolis}  {genre : punk} band {artist : Hüsker Dü} and the successful {genre : alternative} era band {artist : Sugar}. He's now formed trio #3 along with bassist {name : Jason Narducy} and drummer {name : Jon Wurster} ([{artist : Superchunk}](/show/269/), {artist : The Mountain Goats}, [{artist : Scharpling & Wurster}](/show/496/#jonwurster)). Together they've recorded three (of course) albums, most recently the double-{tag : Buy It} earning {album : Patch the Sky}. This week, Bob Mould joins {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} for the *[third](/show/119/)  [time](/show/295/)* in the show's history, this time with Narducy and Wurster in tow. They give a blistering live performance and discusses the vitality of guitar music, finding salvation through rock, and Bob's polarizing turn toward {genre : electronica}.



## 00:42:45 Review: case/lang/veirs

![case/lang/veirs](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/552/1Z90.jpg)

Singer/songwriters {artist : Neko Case}, {artist : k.d. lang} and {artist : Laura Veirs}  have long admired each other's music from afar but didn't really know each other personally. That changed a few years ago when lang sent an email to Case and Veirs asking if they wanted to collaborate.  The result of that email is a new project and album called {album : case/lang/veirs}. {host : Greg} says he was initially skeptical of this so-called "super group" but the trio really delivers. He says the album sounds like a nod to {genre : girl groups} and the {genre : Laurel Canyon} sound and the sum is really greater the parts. {host : Jim} finds the three distinct voices elevate each other. The three women harmonize so well you can't always tell who is singing. While the record is lowkey, Jim is sure the joyful songs will grow on you and then you won't be able to stop listening. {artist : case/lang/veirs} earns a double {tag : Buy It}.



## 00:49:51 DIJ: Jim

This week, {host : Jim} wanted to honor the late {name : Prince Be} of {artist : P.M. Dawn} by taking a track of his to the {tag : Desert Island}. Jim notes that like himself, Prince Be was a misfit music fan who grew up in {place : Jersey City, New Jersey}. He had a rough upbringing but went on to make four superb albums as P.M. Dawn along with his brother, {name : DJ Minutemix}. After the {era : '90s}, Prince Be virtually disappeared, sporadically releasing new music on the internet. Jim feels that he traversed a new path with the {genre : Afrofuturism}/{genre : psychedelic rap} he created, and inspired the sort of work being done today by artists like {artist : Chance the Rapper} and {artist : Janelle Monáe}. Jim chose the song "{track : Downtown Venus}" from the {era : 1995} album {album : Jesus Wept}, a track that exemplifies his genre-melding abilities and skills as a singer. Prince Be died on June 17 at the age of 46 from complications from kidney disease.
