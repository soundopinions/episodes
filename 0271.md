## 00:01:53 News: 02-04-2011
These days it's not unusual for {genre: pop} stars to simultaneously be topping the charts and filling the {tag: court} dockets ({artist: T.I.}, {artist: Lil Wayne}). But it is unusual for a commercial, family-friendly star to have such infamy. Singer/songwriter {artist: Bruno Mars} has the #1 song in the country, "{track: Grenade}," and he's been all over mainstream TV this year with appearances on {tag: *The Today Show*}, {tag: *Saturday Night Live*}, {tag: *Ellen*} and {tag: *Glee*}. Now he's pleading {tag: guilty} to {tag: cocaine} possession charges, so {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} are interested to see if this affects his popularity. Our guess? It won't.

After {artist: Wilco}'s first label, {label: Reprise}, refused to put out their critically acclaimed {era: 2002} album {album: Yankee Hotel Foxtrot}, many people thought they should abandon the major label system. Now, almost a decade later, they're doing it. Wilco is leaving the {label: Warner} subsidiaries to form {label: dBpm Records}. It will be run by the band's manager, with distribution provided by {label: ANTI-}.

{tag: Oscar}-winning composer {name: John Barry} died last week at age 77. The Guardian claims he's as "{genre: pop} as the {artist: Beatles}," and Jim and Greg agree. It's hard to imagine the {era: '60s} without Barry's brassy, melodic orchestrations. He was not only the man behind the iconic {tag: Bond} music, but his compositions were critical to many other {tag: films}. So to honor Barry, Jim and Greg play the theme to {tag: *Midnight Cowboy*}.

## 00:09:39 Interview: Isobel Campbell & Mark Lanegan
Rock is filled with great duos – with {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} at the top of that list, naturally. But coming in at a close second is {artist: Isobel Campbell} and {artist: Mark Lanegan}, who join Jim and Greg in the studio this week. Many people know Campbell as a former member of the {place: Scottish} {genre: pop} group {artist: Belle and Sebastian}. And Lanegan is the iconic voice behind the {artist: Screaming Trees}. For their collaboration, it's Campbell who takes the reins with songwriting and production. Lanegan, they joke during the interview, is just her tool. It's a role he relishes, even if Campbell can be a bit of a taskmaster. And you can't argue with the results. 

## 00:41:20 Review: Destroyer
![Kaputt](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/e1/a6/67/e1a667e4-51b5-eb4a-184b-2c5f8d6970d6/source/600x600bb.jpg "5455211/412955678")
{artist: [The] New Pornographers} fans know {name: Dan Bejar} from his collaborations with the band. But he saves his most adventurous music for his solo project {artist: Destroyer}. Bejar is often all over the map with Destroyer releases, so {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} did not see his latest album coming. {album: Kaputt} has some {era: '80s} {genre: pop} sheen and elements of {genre: smooth jazz} – things Greg doesn't generally like. But upon further listen, Greg began to understand where Bejar was coming from. He especially picked up on the influence of {artist: Blue Nile}. Greg loved the tension between the warm, "pastel" sound and the angst-ridden lyrics. He gives {album: Kaputt} a {tag: Buy It} rating. Jim was also initially put off by the record. And upon further listen he was even more put off. He doesn't understand how after all these years, Bejar's records could still be so mediocre and spotty. The obscurity is not worth the effort. Jim says {tag: Trash It}.

## 00:47:44 Review: The North Mississippi Allstars
![Keys to the Kingdom](http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/26/17/58/261758e7-fa37-ab07-5eae-8a160aa52d71/source/600x600bb.jpg "5116593/414280989")
{artist: The North Mississippi Allstars} also have a new album out, called {album: Keys to the Kingdom}. This album was written following the death of producer {name: Jim Dickinson}, the father of bandmates and brothers {name: Luther [Dickinson]} and {name: Cody Dickinson}, and the songs are not only filled with emotion, but steeped in the sound of their youth – the {genre: blues} of the North {place: Mississippi} hill country. They also collaborate with some of Dickinson's favorite musicians, including {artist: Mavis Staples}. This is a great return to form for the band. Both {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} say {tag: Buy It}.
