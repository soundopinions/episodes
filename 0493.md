# Show 493: Against Me! and Opinions on Blur

![againstme](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2015/againstme_web.jpg)

After coming out as a trans woman in 2012, lead singer Laura Jane Grace of Against Me! candidly addressed her experience in the punk band's critically lauded album {album: Transgender Dysphoria Blues}. Against Me! joins Jim and Greg for a performance and an honest conversation. Later, a review of the new album from Britpop heroes Blur.


## 00:02:13 Intro: Music News

Sad news: singer {artist: Ben E. King} has died at age 76 in {place: New Jersey}. After being discovered in a luncheonette in 1956, King scored a string of hit singles as a member of {artist: The Drifters} and then as a solo artist. With the unique blend of grit and smoothness in his voice, King bridged the gap between the {genre: doo-wop} and {genre: soul} eras â€“ he's the rare artist who's charted in four different decades. He'll forever be remembered for his 1961 solo hit "{track: Stand By Me}," but {host: Greg} also loves his moving performance with The Drifters on the {name: Doc Pomus}-penned "{track: Save the Last Dance For Me}."

Last month we also lost {name: Jack Ely} of the {place: Portland} {genre: garage} band {artist: The Kingsmen}, who sang lead on their immortal 1963 cover of {artist: Richard Berry}'s "{track: Louie Louie}." Rumors spread that Ely's indecipherable singing might be covering up dirty lyrics, outraging then-Attorney General {name: Robert F. Kennedy} and even prompting an FBI investigation. The more prosaic truth may have been that Ely's singing was slurred because his braces had just been tightened. While Ely may not be a household name, without those three chords, there would be no {genre: punk rock} as we know it.

## 00:10:11 Interview: Against Me!
The {genre: punk} band {artist: Against Me!} formed in {place: Gainesville, FL} in 1997 by then lead singer {name: Thomas Gabel} and guitarist {name: James Bowman}. The band took the aesthetics and ideals of punk rock and filtered them through the lens of {genre: classic rock}, {genre: indie rock} and {genre: folk} to create a sound all their own. Against Me! landed a major label deal with {label: Sire Records} but then things began to change. They were dropped by {label: Sire}, the band began to break apart and {name: Thomas Gabel} began a gender transition to {name: Laura Jane Grace}. Laura Jane has documented her transition in the band's 2014 critically lauded album, {album: Transgender Dysphoria Blues}. She and the group sat down with Jim and Greg late last year to discuss the evolution of her personal and musical life. The band also played songs from their 2014 record, to which {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} both gave a {tag: Buy It} rating.


## 00:47:42 Review: Blur
![The Magic Whip](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/493/27I0.jpg)

After a 12-year hiatus, {genre: English rock} band {artist: Blur} returns with its new album, {album: The Magic Whip}. {artist: Graham Coxon} and {artist: Damon Albarn} formed the group in {era: 1989} where they gained success in the {place: UK}. While critics always embraced them, they never quite achieved commercial success in the {place: U.S.} outside of the track "{track: Song 2}." {host: Greg} likes the record and appreciates its honest lyrics and overall strength. He believes this effort is better than the members' solo work. *The Magic Whip* exceeded his expectations and he gives it a {tag: Buy It}. {host: Jim} considers himself a Blur superfan. He argues that there are a few really great songs but the rest range from lukewarm to bad. Jim thinks Blur is starting to slow down a little but still gives the record a {tag: Buy It}.
