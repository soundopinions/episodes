## 00:01:30 News: 01.20.12
Every year it's interesting to look at what albums took the top slots on the {tag: Village Voice Pazz & Jop poll}. This is a much more accurate barometer of any given year in music than the {tag: Grammy Awards}. However, this year Jim and Greg actually gave negative reviews to a lot of the Pazz & Jop winners including {album: Watch the Throne} and {album: Let England Shake}. But they were happy to see {artist: Tune-Yards}' {album: Whokill} at {tag: #1}.

Members of the {artist: Velvet Underground} including {name: John Cale} and {name: Lou Reed} have filed a {tag: lawsuit} against the {tag: Andy Warhol Foundation for Visual Arts} over the famous banana featured on their 1967 album cover. {artist: Warhol} served as {artist: producer} of the album and gave the band the image, however it was never {tag: copyrighted}. And now the Velvets want to prevent the banana from going Apple.

{artist: Jimmy Castor} isn't a household name, but chances are you've heard his music, or at least samples of it. He had a pop-funk hit with "{track: Troglodyte (Cave Man)}" in 1972, but also a string of {genre: funk} and {genre: soul} gems that ended up being sampled by hundreds of hip hop acts. Castor died this week at age 71, so to honor the late musician, Jim and Greg play one of the often-sampled tracks, "{track: It's Just Begun}."

## 00:10:53 List: Short but Sweet
Today's episode highlights the short, but sweet. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} have chosen their favorite tiny tunes that clock in at two minutes or under. There are some musicians and fans that believe that the longer the composition, the more important (Prog rockers we're talking to you), but it is possible to pack all the elements of a successful song-verse, chorus, bridge, even a solo-into a petite punch. So here are the best {tag: Short But Sweet} tracks. But don't blink or you'll miss 'em.

### Greg
- {artist: The White Stripes}, "{track: Fell in Love with a Girl}"
- {artist: Maurice and the Zodiacs}, "{track: Stay}"
- {artist: Aimee Mann}, "{track: Just Like Anyone}" 
- {artist: Eddie Cochran}, "{track: Summertime Blues}"
- {artist: Janis Joplin}, "{track: Mercedes Benz}"

### Jim
- {artist: Wire}, "{track: Three Girl Rhumba}"
- {artist: Nick Drake}, "{track: Road}"
- {artist: The Rock-a-Teens}, "{track: Woo-Hoo}"
- {artist: Leadbelly}, "{track: Black Betty}"
- {artist: The Bongos}, "{track: Glow in the Dark}"

## 00:49:26 Review: Craig Finn
![Clear Heart Full Eyes](//static.soundopinions.org/assets/321/2AE0.jpg)
{artist: Craig Finn} has achieved a fair amount of mainstream success with his indie band {artist: The Hold Steady}. So why would he venture out on his own at this point? According to Jim and Greg, Finn wanted to go a little less rock, a little more country on his solo debut {album: Clear Heart Full Eyes}, inspired, of course, by {tag: *Friday Night Lights*}. He also went for less bombast and more mature lyrics. Those lyrics deserve an A+, says {host: Greg}, but the music falls flat. He says {tag: Burn It}. {host: Jim} doesn't understand why Finn is stepping outside of The Hold Steady, which is a perfect vehicle for his songs. The lyrics are strong when they are funny, but otherwise this is a {tag: Trash It} record.
