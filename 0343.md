## 00:42:34 Review: Neil Young and Crazy Horse
![Americana (Deluxe Edition)](http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/albums/17850/homepage_large.8b1a6091.jpg "167559/530642631")
Despite rumors that the perennial collaborators would never work together again, {artist: Neil Young and Crazy Horse} are back with a new album. The combination that produced {album: Rust Never Sleeps}, {album: Zuma}, and {album: Greendale} just released {album: Americana}, which takes its inspiration from the {genre: American folk} vernacular. Think "{track: Jesus' Chariot}" sounds familiar? You might know it better as "{track: She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain}." So what can we expect when Neil Young and Crazy Horse take on the elementary school songbook? According to {host: Jim}, Crazy Horse is the vehicle Neil Young was meant to drive. It might be a clichÃ©, but they could do a musical version of the phone book and kill. They give new life to these songs by unearthing original verses too dark to have made it to the school recital. Though the tempos are a bit slow, these tracks have a groove, and Young rides it masterfully. Jim says {tag: Buy It}. {tag: Greg} thinks of Neil Young as music's answer to {name: Howard Zinn}. Both are alternative American historians. Just like Neil Young classics "{track: Cortez the Killer}" and "{track: Pocahontas}," these new songs are about the price paid for the conquest of this country. The album works, Greg says, because of the hunger the band brings to songs we take for granted. It's a {tag: Buy it} for him too.

## 00:49:55 DIJ: Jim
Sociologists talk about the concept of a "gateway drug." For his turn at the {tag: Desert Island Jukebox}, {host: Jim} turns to the singer who was his gateway drug to music. When a six-year-old Jim popped his dad's old {artist: Frankie Laine} LP on the record player, he knew music was a mysterious force he couldn't live without. An Italian-American from {place: Chicago}, Frankie Laine remade himself into an icon of the American West. Songs like "{track: High Noon}" and "{track: Rawhide}" are undeniable cheese, but between Laine's rich baritone and those horns, you have to buy whatever he's selling. (And who could forget that scene from The Blues Brothers where the band gets on the good side of a raucous country crowd by playing "Rawhide"?) Jim's song pick, however, is "{track: Cry of the Wild Goose}" - the epitome of Frankie Laine insanity.
