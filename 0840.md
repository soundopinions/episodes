# Show 840: "Gimme Shelter" Singer Merry Clayton & Author Dawnie Walton

Author Dawnie Walton talks with hosts Jim DeRogatis and Greg Kot about what inspired her debut novel, The Final Revival of Opal and Nev, a fantasy rock history about a fierce black singer in the 1970s. Plus Jim and Greg talk with Merry Clayton, whose iconic performance on "Gimme Shelter" still didn't make her a household name. Join our Facebook Group: https://bit.ly/3sivr9TBecome a member on Patreon: https://bit.ly/3slWZvcSign up for our newsletter: https://bit.ly/3eEvRnGMake a donation via PayPal: https://bit.ly/3dmt9lURecord a Voice Memo: https://bit.ly/2RyD5Ah Featured Songs:Merry Clayton, "Southern Man," Merry Clayton, Ode, 1971Material, "Bustin' Out," Bustin' Out, Celluloid, 1981Talking Heads, "Slippery People (Live)," Stop Making Sense, Sire, 1984Betty Davis, "Dedicated To the Press," Nasty Gal, Island, 1975Betty Davis, "They Say I'm Different," They Say I'm Different, Just Sunshine, 1974The Rolling Stones, "Gimme Shelter," Let It Bleed, Decca, 1969Bobby Darin, "Who Can I Count On?," You're the Reason I'm Living, Capitol, 1963Elvis Presley, "Happy Ending," It All Happened At the World's Fair (Original Soundtrack), RCA Victor, 1963Ray Charles, "I Won't Leave," A Portrait of Ray, ABC, 1968Lynyrd Skynyrd, "Sweet Home Alabama," Second Helping, MCA, 1974Merry Clayton, "Touch The Hem Of His Garment," Beautiful Scars, Ode Sounds & Visuals, 2021Merry Clayton, "A Song For You," Merry Clayton, Ode, 1971Merry Clayton, "Deliverance," Beautiful Scars, Ode Sounds & Visuals, 2021Lil Nas X, "Montero (Call Me By Your Name)," Montero, Columbia, 2021
