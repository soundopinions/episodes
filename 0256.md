## 00:01:53 News: 10.22.2010
Europe is really setting the stage for how the {place: U.S.} will approach digital music in the next couple of years, so {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} take a look at news coming out of that region. In {place: France}, the government plans to subsidize legal music downloading to encourage young consumers not to illegally get songs. This is going to cost the French government some $35 million. But, this might sound like a better option than the "three strikes" law to one French {tag: ISP}. Free has declined to send out warning letters to its users. Over in {place: Ireland} the three strikes approach got struck down entirely. The big four labels were unable to convince an Irish court that laws to identify and cut off internet users should be enforceable in that country like others in the {tag: EU}. And finally, one {place: U.K.} music executive offers another [solution](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11547279) entirely: Â£1 records for all!

If you'll only spend a dollar to support a band, how much would you pay to stop them? $10 million? That's how much a former {place: Seattle} fan of {artist: Weezer} intended to raise as part of a [campaign](http://www.thepoint.com/campaigns/campaign-0-1079) to get the {name: Rivers Cuomo}-fronted band to stop playing. Jim and Greg like this idea, but think Weezer might be the wrong target. Who would you pay to (not) play?

## 00:06:19 Special: The Moog
Guitars, bass, drums...blah blah blah. This week it's all about the {tag: Moog}! The {name: Bob Moog}-invented synthesizer has experienced a resurgence in popularity in the past few years. New artists love the analog sound, and many are [gathering](http://moogfest.com/) at next week's {tag: MoogFest} in Bob Moog's adopted hometown of {place: Asheville, NC}. Jim and Greg talk to {name: Brian Kehew}, the {tag: Bob Moog Foundation}'s official historian, about the synthesizer's history and legacy. Kehew also co-founded an all-analog band called {artist: Moog Cookbook} in the '90s and has worked in the studio with {artist: Fiona Apple}, {artist: Aimee Mann} and Moog superstars, {artist: Emerson, Lake & Palmer}. In addition to ELP, Kehew points to the following as great synthesizer musicians:

### Great Moog-ers
- Wendy Carlos
- Stevie Wonder
- Return to Forever
- The Monkees
- Brian Eno
- Kraftwerk
- Kinky
- Chromeo

And two of {host: Jim} and {host: Greg}'s favorite {tag: Moog} tracks are "{track: Chameleon}" by {artist: Herbie Hancock} and "{track: Les Yper-Sound}" by {artist: Stereolab}.

## 00:46:49 Review: Kings of Leon
![Come Around Sundown (Extended Version)](http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/bf/f8/d5/bff8d5f7-3db4-8d94-9ec4-5f1d6b72528e/source/600x600bb.jpg "1883403/395612624")
A couple of weeks ago Jim and Greg [discussed](/show/254/) the career trajectory of {artist: U2}. {artist: Kings of Leon} seem to be on a similar path. The southern "band of brothers" (and cousin) are opening for the Irish band on their 360 tour, and Jim and Greg hear a lot more stadium bombast with their latest release {album: Come Around Sundown}. Lead singer {name: Caleb Followill} has turned on the rawk singing, and no {genre: funk}y or {genre: soul} {genre: blues} cliche was left unturned, according to {host: Jim}. It's way too over the top to him and lacks any experimentation or originality. Jim gives it a {tag: Trash It} rating, adding that this might be one of the worst records of the year. {host: Greg} calls that a ridiculous statement, but agrees that he doesn't like the direction the band is headed. They've lost much of the rhythm and distinctiveness from their 2003 debut. But still, Greg wouldn't throw it in the bin. {artist: Kings of Leon} gets a {tag: Burn It}.
