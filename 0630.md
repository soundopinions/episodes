# Show 630: Bob Ezrin & Amber Mark

![Bob Ezrin](https://static.soundopinions.org/christmas/bobezrin_web.jpg)

{name : Bob Ezrin}, the "producer's producer," has been behind the boards for many blockbuster epic albums over the years. He shares stories with {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} about working on classic albums by {artist : Pink Floyd}, {artist : Alice Cooper}, {artist : Kiss}, and {artist : Peter Gabriel}. Plus, up-and-coming {genre : R&B} singer {artist : Amber Mark} shares the song that got her {tag : Hooked on Sonics}, and Greg drops a quarter into the {tag : Desert Island Jukebox}.



## 00:01:01 Interview: Bob Ezrin

Back in 2011, Jim and Greg were joined by super {tag : producer}  {name : Bob Ezrin}. When we say super, we're not just referring to his commercial success, but to his sound. Bob Ezrin makes big, epic albums like {album : The Wall}, {album : Destroyer} and collaborated on a staggering 10 records with {genre : metal} god {artist : Alice Cooper}. He also produced {artist : Lou Reed}'s {album : Berlin} and the self-titled solo debut from {artist : Peter Gabriel}. He talked with Jim and Greg about reuniting with Cooper for {album : Welcome 2 My Nightmare} and shared studio tidbits. Now we know what a prankster {name : Roger Waters} was and how Ezrin captured the crying sounds in "{track : Oh Jim}." And who knew Peter Gabriel had such a good sense of humor?

This interview was one of our favorites so we thought we'd share it again.



## 00:43:16 Feature: Hooked On Sonics: Amber Mark

![Amber Mark](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/630/2040.jpg)

{artist : Amber Mark} is a young, up-and-coming singer whose sound is a mixture of {genre : R&B}, {genre : soul} and {genre : pop}. Mark recently made a splash with her EP {album : 3:33am}, a record about the sudden passing of her mother. Critics lauded her strong voice and evocative lyrics, and she's currently signed to the British independent label {label : PMR} with distribution through the famous {label : Interscope Records}. Amber Mark shares that the artist that got her "{tag : Hooked on Sonics}" is {artist : Michael Jackson}, and the song that made her love music was the percussive "{track : Working Day and Night}" from his {album : Off the Wall} album. Listen to Amber tell the story of first hearing the song and the unique experience of sitting in the V.I.P. section at Michael's concert in {place : Munich}.



## 00:48:09 DIJ: Greg

{era : 2017} has been a challenging year for many people, and {host : Greg}'s pick for the {tag : desert island jukebox} gave him some solace from the recent turbulence. Inspired by a cover he saw performed by {artist : Ted Leo}, Greg chose "{track : It's O.K.}" by the {place : Portland}  {genre : punk} band {artist : Dead Moon}. Led by a husband and wife duo, Dead Moon was extremely DIY - doing almost all of their own recording and surrounding duties. Recently, Fred Cole (the husband in the duo) passed away. Greg wanted to play this song as a tribute to him, and to encourage others that even though "we've all seen better days…it's okay, yeah we love you anyway."
