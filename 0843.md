![Earl Sweatshirt SICK](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/843/1B12.jpg)

{artist : Earl Sweatshirt} was a member of the shock-rap group {artist : Odd Future}, but like group members {artist : Tyler, The Creator} and {artist : Frank Ocean}, he has matured into a thoughtful artist. His new album, {album : Sick!} grapples with becoming a parent and dealing with pandemic quarantines.



## 00:07:05 Review: FKA twigs

{artist : FKA twigs} is sometimes called the “English {artist : Björk}” for her {genre : experimental pop} albums like {album : Magdalene}. Her current project, {album : Caprisongs}, is called a mixtape rather than an album. It is a more relaxed sound without a strong overarching concept, but still experimental.

Bone Burnett} and where her musical fire comes from.
