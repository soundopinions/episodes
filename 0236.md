## 00:04:54 Intro: Music News

{host : Jim} and {host : Greg} kick off the show by discussing the results of the biggest pop music contest in the world. No, not {tag : American Idol}...{tag : Eurovision}! That television broadcast drew more than 120 million viewers worldwide (compare with Idol's 24 million) and remains the world's most-watched non-sporting event. {place : Germany} is the big winner this year with its contestant 19-year-old {artist : Lena Meyer-Landrut}.



## 00:07:45 Special: The History of the Vocoder

Next {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} are joined by {name : Dave Tompkins}, author of {tag : *How to Wreck a Nice Beach: The Vocoder from World War II to Hip-Hop*}. The {tag : vocoder} is an electronic instrument that produces a distorted, robotic sound. You probably recognize it making an appearance in songs like "{track : Trans Europe Express}," or even "{track : I'm Not Moving}," but you probably don't know about its secret military history. It was developed as a tool to encode speech during wartime and was used by {name : Winston Churchill} and {name : Franklin Roosevelt}–a far cry from {artist : Afrika Bambaattaa}. As Tompkins explains, there's something the human ear finds undeniably fascinating and pleasurable about machine-like voices. And, ultimately, the technology all stems from a desire to make cheaper phone calls.



## 00:35:51 Review: Blitzen Trapper

![Destroyer of the Void (Bonus Track Version)](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/236/1NR0.jpg)

{artist : Blitzen Trapper} kicks off the reviews this week. Their 5th and latest album is called {album : Destroyer of the Void}. Both {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} were big fans of the 2009 {label : Sub Pop} debut {album : Furr}. Greg continues to respect singer {name : Eric Earley}'s songwriting and fondness for traditional American folk sounds. But, he feels like the band is on repeat with this album. It's too predictable and only gets a {tag : Try It} rating from Greg. {host : Jim} can't believe his ears. The moments of departure and growth that Greg loves are the worst parts of the record according to him. Blitzen Trapper is aping {artist : Queen}, and it doesn't work for Jim. It's a "disgrace" and a {tag : Trash It}.



## 00:44:31 Review: Sleigh Bells

![Treats](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/236/2270.jpg)

{artist : Sleigh Bells} has released its debut record, {album : Treats}. The duo of {tag : guitarist} and beat maker {name : Derek Miller} and {tag : vocalist}  {name : Alexis Krauss} made noise at both {place : CMJ} and {place : SXSW}. But to Jim, a self-professed connoisseur of noise, this is too much. Every note is full of massive fuzz and distortion. Everything's at "11," and it gets a {tag : Trash It} from {host : Jim}. {host : Greg} wants us all to note the moment where Jim complained his rock and roll was too loud. It's ear-bleed loud, yes, but it's also a tremendous pop pick-me-up. Greg gives Sleigh Bells a {tag : Buy It}.



## 00:51:29 DIJ: Jim

It's {host : Jim}'s turn to add a song he can't live without to the {tag : Desert Island Jukebox} this week. He honors iconic {tag : actor}  {name : Dennis Hopper}, who died last week at age 74. Hopper not only directed classic movies like {tag : *Easy Rider*}, he chose their soundtracks. So for his track, Jim chooses "{track : The Ballad of Easy Rider}." The version in the film features a solo performance by {name : Roger McGuinn} of {artist : The Byrds}, but Jim prefers the version by the whole band.
