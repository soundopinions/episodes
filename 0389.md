## 00:01:46 Intro: Music News
{artist: Slayer} is undoubtedly one of the most important {genre: metal} acts ever. Heck, in any genre. And one of its founders, {name: Jeff Hanneman}, died recently at age 49. As {host: Greg} explains, this guy really brought the riffs. He and fellow guitarist {name: Kerry King} were like race car drivers, both playing lead guitar and then zooming out ahead. It was especially amazing to witness this live. Unfortunately Jeff didn't join his bandmates for [a visit to our studios](show/250) a few years ago. But we remember him through Slayer's music. Check out "{track: War Ensemble}" from {era: 1990}'s {album: Seasons in the Abyss}.

Say you're Hollywood heavyweight {name: Harvey Weinstein.} Who do you turn to in order to bring {artist: Led Zeppelin} back together for a {tag: Hurricane Sandy} benefit? Why former President {name: Bill Clinton} of course! He's brokered many a deal-both foreign and congressional. So why not a rock and roll deal? Well, turns out the Golden God was not so easily moved by Clinton's charms.
 
## 00:07:50 Interview: Tame Impala
Last year {artist: Lonerism} took top slots on both Jim and Greg's [Best of 2012](/show/367/) lists. Now we've got {artist: Tame Impala} performing those new psychedelic classics live in our studio! And along the way, lead singer {name: Kevin Parker} talks about the band's influences, both expected ({artist: The Flaming Lips}) and not ({artist: Supertramp}), and his desire to work with producer {name: Dave Fridmann}. The {place: Australian} musicians also debate whether actual psychedelic substances contribute to a psychedelic sound. Certainly you don't need them to enjoy the result.

## 00:44:30 Review: Savages
![Album Art](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/389/2260.jpg "https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/silence-yourself/id614945667?uo=4")

Last year, London-based quartet {artist: Savages} burst onto the indie scene seemingly fully formed. {name: Jehny Beth}, {name: Gemma Thompson}, {name: Ayse Hassan}, and {name: Fay Milton} had been a band for less than a year when the {place: UK} music press caught on to "{track: Husbands}," the group's debut single. Critically acclaimed performances at CMJ, {tag: SXSW}, and {tag: Coachella} followed (In our own [SXSW wrap-up](show/382), {host: Jim} declared he had "seen God" at Savages' set). So do they deliver on their {label: Matador Records }debut {album: Silence Yourself}? Jim's answer is an unequivocal "Yes!" Not only does he stand by his previous claim that Jehny Beth is the most compelling rock frontperson since {name: Kurt Cobain}, he extends the {artist: Nirvana} metaphor. Just like that legendary {era: nineties} {genre: grunge} band, Savages take familiar ingredients ({genre: post-punk} and minimalism) and make them fresh. {host: Greg} agrees. This is a serious band, he says, with the album cover manifesto to prove it and the songs to back it up. Silence Yourself gets an enthusiastic double {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:51:18 DIJ: Jim
{artist: Tame Impala}'s Kevin Parker wasn't afraid to declare his love for the admittedly un-hip {artist: Supertramp} during this week's interview, and neither is Jim. Jim celebrates the {place: British} band's signature mix of prog and pop during this week's {tag: DIJ}. He says "{track: Take the Long Way Home}" from {era: 1979}'s {album: Breakfast in America} is characteristic of the band's simultaneously sunny and threatening take on {genre: orchestral pop}.
