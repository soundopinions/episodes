## 00:41:36 Review: First Aid Kit
![Ruins](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/636/1XC0.jpg)
The Swedish duo {artist: First Aid Kit} is returning with their fourth studio album, {album: Ruins}. The band, made up of sisters Johanna and Klara SÃ¶derberg, is known for their beautiful and intricate harmonies. While {host: Jim} loves these harmonies, he finds that Ruins relies on that strength a bit too much. He loves when the duo ups the production with a big backing band sound that pushes them out of their comfort zone. He thinks Ruins is half a great album and gives it a {tag: Try It}. {host: Greg} really enjoys First Aid Kit, and loves when they show a different, {genre: rock}ing side to them. He loved when the band performed a cover of {artist: Black Sabbath}'s "{track: War Pigs}" when he saw them on tour in 2015. He also loved their single "{track: You Are the Problem Here}," a song that eviscerates men who abuse their power to harass women. Greg wishes he would have seen more of the duo's intense side, but he enjoys the harmonies and beautiful vocals the band supplies. He gives it a {tag: Try It}. 


## 00:47:42 Feature: Obit: Mark E. Smith
![CMark E. Smith](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/636/27I0.jpg)
{artist: Mark E. Smith}, the lead singer of the {genre: post-punk} band {artist: The Fall}, died at the age of 60. The Fall emerged in 1976 and with 32 studio albums and some additional 30 live albums, one can see how the band is both impactful and daunting. Their sound was grinding and aggressive, often paired with Smith's caustic lyrics. {host: Jim} has mixed thoughts about The Fall and Smith's aggressive performances, but thinks that there are about a dozen or so great tracks worth your time. {host: Greg} thinks there are plenty of songs and albums to recommend to the uninitiated. Smith had some great tracks on {era: early '90s} albums like {album: The Infotainment Scan}, showing moments of entry points. However both hosts agree that Smith's contribution to music as a lyricist and performer was one-of-a-kind.
