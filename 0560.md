The excitement of the {tag: Olympics} in {place: Rio de Janeiro} will soon fade into memory, but the music coming out of {place: Brazil} has endured for centuries. {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} bring the {tag: Sound Opinions World Tour} to Brazil and explore the country's rich musical heritage. Of course, Brazil is enormous and has produced more genres of music than we could even name. So Jim and Greg focus first on the pivotal period of 1958-1968, beginning with the rise of {genre: bossa nova}. Our guide is {name: Sérgio Mielniczenko}, host of *[The Brazilian Hour](http://www.brazilianhour.org/)* radio show since 1978. He explains how the deceptively minimalistic yet harmonically complex music of {artist: João Gilberto}, {artist: Antônio Carlos Jobim}, {artist: Sérgio Mendes}, and other bossa nova artists revolutionized music in Brazil and around the world.

But in 1964, just as "{track: The Girl From Ipanema}" was becoming a global hit, Brazil's government was overthrown in a military coup. Artists like {artist: Edu Lobo}, {artist: Chico Buarque}, and {artist: Geraldo Vandré} turned to socially conscious protest songs in response. This post-bossa nova generation became known as música popular brasileira (Brazilian popular music) or {genre: MPB}. Meanwhile, the {genre: Jovem Guarda} (Young Guard) led by {artist: Roberto Carlos} created an apolitical form of Brazilian {genre: rock 'n' roll}. And in the late '60s, the {genre: Tropicália} movement blended high art, lowbrow kitsch, traditional Brazilian rhythms, {genre: psychedelic rock}, and electric instruments into an irreverent mix. Tropicalistas like {artist: Caetano Veloso}, {artist: Gilberto Gil}, {artist: Os Mutantes}, {artist: Tom Zé}, and {artist: Gal Costa} were curtailed by the government crackdown of 1968, but their music has proved influential for decades.

Jim and Greg also want to acknowledge all of the great new music coming out of Brazil. {name: Chris McGowan}, author of *[The Brazilian Sound](https://www.amazon.com/Brazilian-Sound-Samba-Popular-Brazil/dp/1592139299)* and *[The Brazilian Music Book](https://www.amazon.com/Brazilian-Music-Book-Songwriters-Musicians-ebook/dp/B009KBTJAC)*, calls in from Rio and explains that Brazil is a large country and there are a huge variety of popular musical styles. He runs through some of the most popular genres of the moment, starting with {genre: sertanejo}, Brazilian {genre: country} music. They also talk about new {genre: avant-garde} music, Brazilian {genre: hip hop}, and {genre: electronic dance} genres {genre: Axé} and {genre: tecno brega}. 


## 00:50:15 Review: Ryley Walker
![Golden Sings That Have Been Sung (Deep Cuts Edition)](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/560/2BR0.jpg)

{tag: Singer-songwriter} {artist: Ryley Walker} hails from the {place: Chicago} {genre: independent music} scene, and puts his complex guitar skills on exhibition in his latest release {album: Golden Sings That Have Been Sung}. Many critics have drawn comparisons between Walker and {artist: Van Morrison} because of his singing and {tag: guitar virtuoso} talent. {host: Jim} first discovered Ryley Walker at {tag: South By Southwest} and was blown away. Jim cites Walker's production collaboration with {name: Leroy Bach}, formerly of {artist: Wilco}, as something that helped elevate his music to a new level. Overall, he finds that Walker's introspective vocals and guitar playing are the highlights of the album, and gives it a {tag: Buy It}. {host: Greg} agrees, and thinks Walker has evolved on this record, establishing his own modern sound. He thinks Walker blends his complex guitar parts with more unusual sonic elements to perfection. Greg gives *Golden Sings That Have Been Sung* a {tag: Buy It}.
