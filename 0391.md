# Show 391: Wild Belle & Daft Punk Review

## 00:01:48 News: 5.24.2013
Last week over 125 million viewers worldwide watched {name: Emmelie de Forest} of {place: Denmark} take the top prize in the {tag: Eurovision Song Contest}. The 58th edition of the televised songfest was held in the home of former contestants {artist: Abba}. But perhaps more interesting than the pop music, is the geopolitical tensions. For example, Russia claims its entry at the finals was pushed into a fifth place as a consequence of vote-stealing in Azerbaijan, leading to tension between the countries. Germany, too, is unhappy with its showing, blaming the euro zone crisis and Chancellor Angela Merkel's austerity measures.

Our own pop music contest, *{tag: American Idol}*, wrapped up its 12th season and crowned {name: Candice Glover }the winner. But, while her cover of "{track: Lovesong}" was a highlight, the season itself was a low point for {tag: Fox}. Ratings dropped 44% from last year, and total viewership plummeted by 7 million. Compared with {tag: NBC} competitor *{tag: The Voice}*, Greg thinks the show has become your grandparents' *{tag: American Idol}* and wonders if anyone will care about poor Candice like they once did [Kelly](http://www.kellyclarkson.com/).

At the end of the news Jim and Greg bid farewell to {artist: The Doors} co-founder {name: Ray Manzarek}. The keyboard player died Monday at age 74. And as Greg explains, he was integral to creating the band's iconic dark, L.A. sound. He brought in elements from his southside {place: Chicago} upbringing, as well as his {genre: classical} and {genre: jazz} training. You can hear that in The Doors' famous track "{track: Riders on the Storm}."

## 00:09:30 Interview: Wild Belle
Last year was a big one for {artist: Wild Belle}. Built on the brother-sister duo of {name: Elliot [Bergman]} and {name: Natalie Bergman}, the quintet released a terrific single "{track: Keep You}," shopped a self-financed/self-produced album and signed a 3-album deal with {label: Columbia Records}. You can hear the fruits of their labor as they [perform](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz9W8F2PZCOpgtMVWjIIuZZi3bkpb3U6z) songs from that major label debut, {album: Isles}. But if this music thing doesn't work out, Elliot always has [this](http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsampson/sets/72157623171397039/comments/) to fall back on.

## 00:44:45 Review: Daft Punk
![Random Access Memories](http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music2/v4/0c/8c/4a/0c8c4a84-465f-ee54-d999-eb0743d224ef/source/600x600bb.jpg "5468295/617154241")

After eight years without a proper studio album, {artist: Daft Punk} - the DJ duo of {name: Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo} and {name: Thomas Bangalter} - is back with {album: Random Access Memories}. The robots get an assist on album No. 4 from an impressive roster of live musicians, including disco greats {name: Nile Rodgers} and {name: Giorgio Moroder}. So what does the biggest act in EDM today think of the dance music boom it's spawned? {host: Greg} says judging by Random Access Memories, the robots aren't big fans of modern EDM. This album sees Daft Punk connecting with its roots, {host: Greg} says, embracing live performance, {genre: disco}, and {genre: jazz-fusion} in an attempt to give computer music some soul. There's no question R.A.M. has major quality control issues, Greg says, but it's an ambitious album well worth a Try It. {host: Jim} agrees. At a time when EDM artists are trying to sound like machines, he applauds Daft Punk's effort to make machines sound human. And it doesn't hurt that they give younger EDM fans a history lesson in the bargain. Jim gives Random Access Memories a {tag: Try It}.

## 00:51:56 DIJ: Greg
{name: Ray Manzarek}'s death gets {host: Greg} thinking about bands that have carried {artist: The Doors}' dark {place: L.A.} aesthetic into the present day. For his {tag: DIJ}, he goes with {artist: The Warlocks}' {era: 2002} album {album: Phoenix}. It wasn't just The Warlocks' lyrics that were dark, he says, it was also their music. As many as ten players contributed to the band's moody, wall-of-sound onstage. The lyrics to "{track: Shake the Dope Out}" could be about drugs, but Greg thinks they could also be referring to the overwhelming feeling of the band's music.
