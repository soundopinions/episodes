## News: 10.12.07
00:01:49 Last week {name: Jammie Thomas}, the first of 20,000 people the {tag: RIAA} accused of infringement to go to trial, lost her battle with the record labels. A jury in {place: Duluth, MN} found Thomas liable for infringing {tag: copyright} on 24 major-label recordings and awarded the record industry $220,000 in damages. Most of the other people sued settled out of court, but as her attorney {name: Brian Toder} explains to Jim and Greg, Thomas insisted that she did not download copyrighted songs to make them available for sharing in a folder on the {tag: KaZaA} {tag: peer-to-peer }network. {name: Eric Bangeman}, the managing editor of the website Ars Technica, also speaks to Jim and Greg about this issue, and he notes that this was a key point in the trial. The judge in the trial instructed the jury that the prosecution didn't have to prove that any music was actually shared, just that Thomas made the files available for sharing. Toder and his legal team are gearing up for an appeal, and Thomas has proclaimed herself a permanent thorn in the side of the record industry, but until actual laws are changed to reflect the digital age, it's doubtful any thorns will be able to penetrate the thick hide of the RIAA.

## 00:13:58 Interview: John Cale
{artist: John Cale} is known for many things: co-founding {artist: The Velvet Underground}, producing major albums for {artist: The Stooges} and {artist: Patti Smith}, and doing one of the best covers of {artist: Leonard Cohen}'s "{track: Hallelujah}." So when John Cale was touring in support of his most recent album {album: Black Acetate} in 2006, Jim and Greg wanted him to stop by the Sound Opinions studio to be their first guest on public radio. Now almost 100 episodes later, we wanted to revisit that terrific conversation.

During Cale's visit, the three men covered everything from {name: Brian Eno} to {name: Lou Reed} to {artist: Snoop Dogg}. And, Cale played two of his songs live: "{track: Set Me Free}" and "{track: Gravel Drive}," which he names as his favorite track on the record. He explains to Jim and Greg that this song was his way of talking to his daughter about some complicated issues, and why "Dad" sometimes wasn't around. Greg notes that despite Cale's admitted anger, and his undeniable {genre: punk rock} attitude, a number of the songs on {album: Black Acetate} are equally heartfelt and beautiful.

## 00:42:36 Review: Annie Lennox
![Songs of Mass Destruction (Bonus Track Version)](http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music/v4/fb/28/d0/fb28d062-7445-040c-0dd9-f31024b15a49/source/600x600bb.jpg "14000/264719325")
{album: Songs of Mass Destruction} is {genre: pop} diva {artist: Annie Lennox}'s first album in over four years, but for her die-hard fans, anything she does is well worth the wait. On this effort, she not only tackles life post-divorce, but also the African {tag: AIDS} crisis. The track "{track: Sing}" features 23 singers including {artist: Madonna}, {artist: k.d. lang}, and {artist: Celine Dion}, and was written to raise awareness about the pandemic of HIV/AIDS in South Africa. Both Jim and Greg praise Lennox for this song and her always impressive, soulful voice. But Greg for one wishes she wasn't attracted to such glossy production. For {album: Songs of Mass Destruction}, she hired {name: Glen Ballard}, the producer who is responsible for some of the most generic, "schlocky" albums ever made by people like {artist: Barbra Streisand} and {artist: Aerosmith}. The slickness doesn't allow Lennox's voice to shine, so {host: Greg} has to give this album a {tag: Try It}. {host: Jim} agrees Lennox would benefit from a turn with a more authentic producer and grittier band, but he can't deny her voice. He gives it a {tag: Buy It}.

## 00:50:04 DIJ: Greg
The {artist: Annie Lennox} review prompted Greg to think about other {place: UK} {genre: soul} singers. Of course there's {artist: Amy Winehouse} now, but the mother of them all was {artist: Dusty Springfield}. Many people know Dusty for her song "{track: Son of a Preacher Man}," which was featured in the movie {tag: Pulp Fiction}. But the track Greg wants to take with him to the desert island is "{track: The Look of Love}," which was written by {name: Burt Bacharach} and {name: Hal David}. For Greg it highlights Dusty's subtle sexy voice, one that is almost doing a duet with the saxophone. And it also summed up, at one time, what Greg thought marriage was going to be all about: lust, romance and glamorous hair.
