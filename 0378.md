## 00:01:50 Intro: Music News
{artist: Lady Gaga} has cancelled her "{tag: Born This Way}" tour due to a hip injury. Millions of little monsters will be deprived of 22 national shows. And the Gaga camp might be out $35 million. With all the dancing and acrobatics, it's surprising more pop artists aren't wiped out by injuries which gives {host: Jim} and {host: Greg} a new appreciation for {artist: Tina Turner}.

In other concert news, {artist: Paul McCartney} will be headlining the {tag: Bonnaroo Festival} in {place: Tennessee}.  He'll be joined by {artist: Mumford and Sons} and {artist: Tom Petty}, but also {artist: Wu-Tang Clan} and {artist: Nas}-some surprising additions to the traditionally roots and jam festival. Concertgoers will also be excited to hear about the {tag: Firefly Festival}'s plans for its second year, including the{artist:  Yeah Yeah Yeahs} and {artist: Kendrick Lamar}. Here in {place: Chicago}, the {tag: Pitchfork [Music] Festival} has booked {artist: Bjork} and in perplexing move, controversial hometown artist {artist: R. Kelly}.

Finally, Jim and Greg bid farewell to {tag: songwriter} and {tag: producer} {name: Shadow Morton}. He was instrumental in bringing the {artist: Shangri-Las} to fame with hits like "{track: Leader of the Pack}" and "{track: Remember}" that compressed teen angst dramas into three-minute pop operas. Shadow also later worked with {artist: Janis Ian} and {artist: The New York Dolls}.

## 00:49:42 Review: Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds
![Push the Sky Away (Deluxe Edition)](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/378/2AU0.jpg)

{artist: Nick Cave}, of [{artist: Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds}](show/153), is a modern renaissance man-novelist, poet, actor, playwright, and of course {genre: rock}er. Now, with his band, he's released the ensemble's 15th album called {album: Push the Sky Away}. {host: Greg} is impressed with the scope of the lyrics-from the God Particle to Hannah Montana. This record is more introspective and more minimalist, and Greg says {tag: Buy It}. {host: Jim} is disappointed and wishes the tracks were less monotonous and less quiet. He misses the punk explosion and can only recommend you {tag: Burn It}.
