The Duluth, Minnesota band {artist : Low} had two consistent members over their decades of music: husband and wife team of Alan Sparhawk and Mimi Parker. They recorded an in-studio session for Sound Opinions in 2011 after their album “C'mon” was released. Following in the musical legacy of The Velvet Underground and Galaxie 500, Low's music appears simple, but there is musical complexity beneath the surface, which fueled 13 studio albums. Mimi Parker died in November at age 55.
