## 00:01:46 Special: Christmas Spectacular 2008
It's the Sound Opinions {tag: Christmas} Spectacular! Every year Jim and Greg hand the show's reigns over to the official Sound Opinions holiday music curator, {name: Andy Cirzan} (aka DJ Lo-Fi). By day, Cirzan is the Vice President of Concerts at {tag: Jam Productions}, the largest independent concert promoter in the country. But by night, Cirzan scours the earth to find rare, and often times wacky, holiday music to add to his collection. This year is no exception.
