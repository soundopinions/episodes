## 00:02:17 Intro: Music News

After much debate, {place : France} has passed its {tag : three strikes law} against filesharers. That means that if you are caught illegally downloading three times your internet could be shut down. It also signals an alliance between the French government and the record industry, and according to the {tag : EU}, a limiting of personal freedom.

Speaking of limited personal freedom, the Chinese government continues to hinder access to popular music. Eager to curb potential protests, {place : China}'s Ministry of Culture has cancelled major {artist : Oasis} shows and moved the major {tag : MIDI festival} from centrally located {place : Beijing}. {host : Jim} is not usually a fan of censorship, but actually favors an {artist : Oasis} crackdown.

While we in this country have been busy with {tag : American Idol}, {place : Europe}ans were anxiously anticipating the winner of the biggest song contest in the world. This year's {tag : Eurovision} winner is {name : Alexander Rybeck} of {place : Norway}. More than 100 million people watched his song "{track : Fairytale}" take the crown. Of course, {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} don't take this contest too seriously, but it's nice to know that the love of schlock {genre : pop} is universal.





## 00:07:43 Interview: Nelson George

Music critic, author and screenwriter {name : Nelson George} joins {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} on the show this week. His many books have become cornerstones on American thinking about {genre : hip hop}, {genre : soul} and {genre : pop} music. Now he has a new book out called {tag : *City Kid: A Writer's Memoir of Ghetto Life and Post-Soul Success*}. After years of exploring the lives of others, including {name : Chris Rock}, {name : James Brown} and {name : Russell Simmons}, Nelson took himself on as a subject. He relays his experience growing up in {place : Brownsville}. Music and art gave him a way to experience the outside world and later became his ticket to success. He even made his way to {place : Hollywood}, writing and producing the hip hop parody film {tag : CB4}.



## 00:36:41 Review: Eminem

![Relapse](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/182/1P50.jpg)

One of {genre : hip hop's} most successful artists is {artist : Eminem}. After a five-year wait, he's back with a new album called {album : Relapse}. The {place : Detroit} rapper has again sought help from producer {name : Dr. Dre}, and is again relying on violence and misogyny to shock and entertain listeners. The problem-it's not so shocking anymore. Both {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} were bored by this record, and Greg hears boredom in Eminem's own voice. Perhaps Em should try a little good taste for a change. He gets a double {tag : Trash It}.



## 00:43:23 Review: Passion Pit

![Manners (Bonus Track Version)](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/182/20B0.jpg)

The next album up for review is {album : Manners}, the debut from {place : Boston}-based {artist : Passion Pit}. The {genre : electro-pop} quintet is helmed by {name : Michael Angelakos}. It's his falsetto that dominates the album, in addition to the lush, swirling synths. In fact, the music is a little too lush and sugary for Mr. Kot, who wishes there were a few more moments of calm. He gives {album : Manners} a {tag : Try It} rating. {host : Jim} was certain {host : Greg} would be all over this record. He hears the music as a successful, {genre : indie} take on {era : '80s}Â  {genre : disco} and gives the album a {tag : Buy It}.



## 00:49:04 DIJ: Jim

Jim and {host : Greg's} choices for the Desert Island Jukebox are often influenced by current events or discussion in an episode. But this week, {host : Jim} just wanted to hear some {artist : Buzzcocks}. Their album {album : Singles Going Steady} is one of the great compilation albums of all time. But the one great single that didn't make it on is the band's 1979 song "{track : I Believe}." Is it a manifesto? Or just a joke? Jim doesn't know, but he'll be happy listening over and over again.
