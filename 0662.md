## 00:29:52 Interview: Phoebe Bridgers

{genre: Singer-songwriter} {artist: Phoebe Bridgers} has been performing at open mics since she was 11 years old and grew up busking at farmers' markets in her native {place: Los Angeles}. Now 23, {artist: Bridgers} has been lauded for her captivating musicianship, dusky vocals, and lyrical eloquence. (Channeling his other life as an English professor, {host: Jim} compares her to Joan Didion.) Bridgers's songs pull no punches, covering topics like heartbreak and loss, living with depression, and the shadowy underside of her sunny home state. She stopped by the {place: Goose Island Tap Room} in {place: Chicago} to perform "{track: Smoke Signals}" and a few other tracks off her 2017 album {album: Stranger in the Alps}. She talks to {host: Greg} and {host: Jim} about the meaning behind the album's title, how to silence a restless crowd, and the pervasive sexism of the music industry.
