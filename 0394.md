## 00:01:47 Intro: Music News
{tag: Google} recently made big news with its new streaming radio service. But once again, {tag: Apple} is here to take back the spotlight. {tag: iTunes Radio} will allow users to customize their stations, like with {tag: Pandora}, and use "DJ {tag: Siri}" to make requests. Who will win the battle of the streams? It might be a fight to the death.

Speaking of {tag: Pandora}, the company recently bought its own terrestrial radio station. But it isn't as much interested in getting into the traditional radio biz as it is benefiting from arcane royalty regulations. Radio corporations like {tag: Clear Channel }pay less in royalties than digital {tag: streaming} sites like Pandora. {tag: Hits 102.7}'s new tagline may be, "Take that {tag: ASCAP}!"

## 00:05:12 List: Great Family Bands
The family that plays together, stays together, right? If you've ever traveled in a van you're your mother, father, sister or brother, you know it's not that easy. But these great {tag: Family Bands} made it work. Happy Father's Day from Sound Opinions!

## 00:43:48 Review: The Handsome Family
![Wilderness](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/394/2100.jpg)

{host: Jim} and {host: Greg} continue the family theme with a review of {album: Wilderness}, the 10th studio album from husband-and-wife duo {artist: The Handsome Family}. Formed in {place: Chicago} in the {era: '90s}, {name: Brett [Sparks]} and {name: Rennie Sparks}' Handsome Family has often been lumped in with {genre: alternative country}. But {host: Greg} contends that the band's macabre lyrics and pre-rock influences have always set it apart. {host: Jim} says {album: Wilderness} proves that more than ten albums into its career, The Handsome Family still represents the ["old weird America"](http://us.macmillan.com/theoldweirdamerica/GreilMarcus)  better than any group in rock. Who else sings about {name: General Custer} and malicious [octopi](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-NHP_B-b7k)? He says {tag: Buy it}. Greg agrees; With lyrics that run the gamut from sci-fi to magical realism, and music that draws equally from Stephen Foster and chamber pop, Wilderness sounds completely unique. Double {tag: Buy it}.

## 00:50:40 DIJ: Jim
Until [recently](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/06/03/130603fa_fact_halberstadt), {artist: Sonic Youth}'s {name: Kim Gordon} and {name: Thurston Moore} were one of the most visible families in rock. For his DIJ, {host: Jim} commemorates the group's best track (in his humble opinion). "{track: Death Valley 69}" from {era: 1985}'s {album: Bad Moon Rising} is also about a family: the {tag: Manson Family}. Written by Moore and {artist: Teenage Jesus} and the {artist: Jerks}' {name: Lydia Lunch}, the track captures the insanity of {name: [Charles] Manson}'s cult with some pretty insane hooks.
