# Show 460: Tweedy

![work_web](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2014/tweedy_web.jpg)

Jeff & Spencer are "{artist : Tweedy}." The {artist : Wilco} frontman and his son join us for a special recording in front of a live audience at Chicago's {place : Lincoln Hall}.



## 00:02:40 Intro: Music News

Last week, Irish rock band {artist : U2} invited itself into your home (or rather, your {tag : iTunes} library) without a formal invitation. In a shrewd distribution move by the band, U2 partnered with technology giant {tag : Apple} to share its new album {album : Songs of Innocence} for free with its 500 million iTunes users. Apple reportedly paid the band $100 million dollars for the honor, which {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} know is a better sum than {name : Bono} and company would receive through traditional sales. So far, 33 million people have accessed {album : Songs of Innocence}, but not everyone was excited about their free gift--prompting Apple to release an official "removal tool." Jim can't help but laugh, wishing he had this tool from the beginning of his on-again, off-again relationship with {artist : U2}.

## 00:06:50 Interview: Tweedy

This past July, Sound Opinions took the show out of the {place : WBEZ} studios and in front of a live audience at Chicago's {place : Lincoln Hall}. The impetus for a field trip? {artist : Tweedy}, the new project by {artist : Wilco} lead singer and founder {name : Jeff Tweedy}. The band features Jeff on vocals and guitar, Jeff's 18-year-old son {name : Spencer Tweedy} on drums, {name : Liam Cunningham} on keyboards, {name : Jim Elkington} on guitars & {name : Darrin Gray} on bass. Jeff and Spencer spoke with Jim and Greg about how the 20 song album, {album : Sukierae}, came together after Spencer played drums on {album : One True Vine}, the Jeff Tweedy-produced album by {artist : Mavis Staples}. In fact, Spencer calls Mavis another "Grandma." {album : Sukierae} came at a much-needed time for the Tweedy family; Jeff's wife, {name : Sue Miller}, began her fight against lymphoma. And her nickname provides the album its title. So what is it like to tour with your dad and play actual "Dad Rock"? What happens if Spencer dates a {artist : Wilco} fan? And when can we expect new {artist : Wilco} music from the now-20-year-old band? Tune in for answers to those questions, plus songs from the new record.
