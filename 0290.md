## 00:06:25 Interview: Arcade Fire
{artist: Arcade Fire} has had quite a trajectory. First they were a group of anthemic art rockers from {place: Montreal}. Then they released {album: Funeral}, a successful first effort on {label: Merge Records}, followed by {album: Neon Bible}, which debuted at {tag: #2 } on the {tag: Billboard Chart}. They were invited to {tag: open} for {artist: U2} and their latest release {album: The Suburbs} won the top prize at last year's {tag: Grammy Awards}. {host: Jim} and Greg spoke to {name: Régine Chassagne} and {name: Will Butler} a couple of years ago, and now we've managed to fit all seven musicians into our studio for a memorable [live performance](http://www.wbez.org/content/arcade-fire-premiere-new-arrangements-sprawl-ii-and-we-used-wait-sound-opinions). They also talk to Will and bandmate {name: Richard Parry} about the "shock and awe" of winning a Grammy, performing during the {tag: Wrigley Field seventh inning stretch} and why folks still wonder, "Who the F is Arcade Fire?"

## 00:47:18 Review: Battles
![Gloss Drop (Bonus Track Version)](//static.soundopinions.org/assets/290/26U0.jpg "33568718/436917460")
{artist: Battles} really wowed indie rock audiences with their 2007 release {album: Mirrored}. Now the experimental rock group is back with {album: Gloss Drop}. They are down a lead singer, {name: Tyondai Braxton}, but up a few guest vocalists. Greg notes that a lot of the terms used to describe Battles don't do the band any justice. "{genre: Math Rock}," "New {genre: Prog} Rock," and others don't indicate the sense of joy and play infused in their sound. He thought that the loss of Braxton would be a heavy blow, but now they are using vocals as just another layer and texture and it really works. {host: Greg} says {tag: Buy It}. {host: Jim}, however, does miss Braxton. Nothing on *Gloss Drop* is as good as "{track: Atlas}." The instrumental tracks are quite strong, but the songs featuring {tag: vocal cameos} by the likes of {name: Gary Numan} don't work for Jim. He says {tag: Burn It}.
