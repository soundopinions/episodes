# Show 676: Lennon v. McCartney Solo Careers & Opinions on Vince Staples & Makaya McCraven

![paul and john](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2018/paul_john.jpg)

This week, {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} discuss the post-{artist : Beatles} careers of {artist : John Lennon} and {artist : Paul McCartney}... The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Plus, they review a stripped down new release from {genre : rap}per {artist : Vince Staples} and a {genre : hip-hop} infused {genre : jazz} album from drummer {artist : Makaya McCraven}.



## 00:01:46 List: Lennon & McCartney Solo Careers

This week, {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} reevaluate the post-{artist : Beatles} careers of {artist : Paul McCartney} and {artist : John Lennon}. According to Greg, it is "wrong headed" to simply label John as "the rocker" and Paul as the melodic one. The conversation is particularly timely because of the recent release of a fresh box set of Lennon's {tag : 1971} classic recording {album : Imagine}, as well as the recent release of McCartney's latest album, {album : Egypt Station}.

Rather than setting this up as a clash of the titans, Jim and Greg shine a light on lesser known corners of Lennon and McCartney's respective catalogs. Jim noted the value of "digging into a catalog that we think we know" to uncover "new nuggets of revelation." In that digging they uncover the good, and the bad...


### The Good

- {artist : John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band}, "{track : Gimme Some Truth}"
- {artist : Paul McCartney}, "{track : Every Night}"
- {artist : John Lennon}, "{track : #9 Dream}"
- {artist : Paul McCartney and Wings}, "{track : Beware My Love}"


### The Bad

- {artist : John Lennon and Yoko Ono}, "{track : Cambridge 1969}"
- {artist : Paul McCartney and Linda McCartney}, "{track : Uncle Albert / Admiral Halsey}"
- {artist : John Lennon}, "{track : Surprise, Surprise (Sweet Bird of Paradox)}"
- {artist : Paul McCartney}, "{track : Temporary Secretary}"



## 00:34:57 Review: Vince Staples

![vince](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/676/1M90.png)

Earlier this month, {genre : rap}per {artist : Vince Staples} suprise dropped his third album, {album : FM!} On this record, he combines catchy summer beats with devastating lyrics about violence, drugs and problems in his hometown of {place : Long Beach, California}. {host : Jim} thinks FM! is Staples's best work yet. Noting that the album is a tight 22 minutes, he believes his balance of cutting lyrics and party grooves puts him on par with the likes of {artist : Kendrick Lamar}. {host : Greg} thinks Staples artfully blends the {place : west coast}, {genre : g-funk} style with lyrics about the cycle of violence and suffering in black communities to great effect. He believes that Staples has brought something different to the table with each record, and thinks FM! is the perfect balance of introspection and celebration.



## 00:42:41 Review: Makaya McCraven

![Universal Beings](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/676/1Z50.jpg)

{artist : Makaya McCraven} is a young, {place : Chicago}-based {genre : jazz} drummer who also deconstructs his own live improvisational recordings to make hip hop reworks. Makaya's latest album, titled {album : Universal Beings}, features young jazz luminaries like bassist {artist : Junius Paul}, horn player {artist : Shabaka Hutchings}, jazz harpist {artist : Brandee Younger}, and cellist {artist : Tomeka Reid}. Also featured on guitar is {artist : Jeff Parker}, who is probably best known as a member of Chicago {genre : post-rock} group {artist : Tortoise}; but Parker is a staple on the jazz underground scene, as well.

Makaya took the products of recording sessions in {place : New York}, {place : Chicago}, {place : Los Angeles}, and {place : London} and electronically condensed, looped, and reworked them for the tracks on the final album. Jim and Greg compare Makaya's process to {name : Teo Macero}'s post-production edits of {artist : Miles Davis} sessions during Miles' electric period on albums like {album : On The Corner}. Greg notes that the album has the crossover appeal of work by other young jazz artists like {artist : Thundercat}, {artist : Robert Glasper}, and {artist : Kamasi Washington}. They both agree that {album : Universal Beings} is a great introduction to a new international underground jazz scene. Jim adds that {album : Universal Beings} "is a brilliant... and, yet easy to listen to... seductive album".



## 00:49:08 DIJ: Jim

This week, {host : Jim} is taking the {artist : X} track "{track : The Have Nots}" to the {tag : desert island jukebox}. He decided to revisit the {genre : punk rock} band X after a friend mentioned he recently saw them in concert again for the first time in many years. So Jim listened to the group during a long drive across the midwest, and was digging their album {album : Under the Big Black Sun} in particular. The song "The Have Nots" is a track about working class people just trying to get through the day, and sometimes we're all just trying to get through the day.
