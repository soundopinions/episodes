# Show 661: Alice Cooper, Opinions on Chance the Rapper & Deafheaven

![Alice](https://static.soundopinions.org/images/2018/alice_cooper2.jpg)

{artist : Alice Cooper} invented {genre : shock-rock} in the {era : 1970s}, sparking controversy with his ghoulishly theatrical live shows and hard rock hits like "{track : School's Out}" and "{track : I'm Eighteen}." Alice Cooper joins {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} for a career-spanning conversation. They'll also review new music from {artist : Chance the Rapper} and {artist : Deafheaven}.



## 00:01:25 Review: Chance The Rapper

![I Might Need Security - Single](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/661/2D0.jpg)

{artist : Chance The Rapper} just dropped his latest EP, {album : 4 new songs}, which was technically released as 4 concurrent singles: {track : Wala Cam}, {track : 65th & Ingleside}, {album : I might Need Security}, and {track : Work Out}. The release immediately made news for more reasons than one. First off, the rapper hasn't released a solo project since {album : Coloring Book} in 2016. That project garnered critical acclaim, as well as 3 {tag : Grammys}. Secondly, on {track : I Might Need Security}, a fiery track on {album : 4}, Chance announced that he had purchased the {tag : Chicagoist}(a now defunct news and culture website that was a sister site to the {track : Gothamist}). Greg notes that the song also addresses Chicago Mayor {name : Rahm Emmanuel}, and Illinois Governor {name : Bruce Rauner} for the way that they have dealt with police-involved shootings and violence in {place : Chicago}. Greg notes that the EP shows a more {tag : political} slant than he has previously; but also showcases a vulnerable side with {track : 65th & Ingleside}. {host : Greg} calls that track "refreshing" in the way that it deals with Chance's relationship with his now-fiancée and child. "Security" is, according to {host : Jim}, "the song that everyone is talking about [on 4], but '65th and Ingleside', that's the brilliant one here".



## 00:08:30 Review: Deafheaven

![Ordinary Corrupt Human Love](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/661/E60.jpg)

{album : Ordinary Corrupt Human Love} is {artist : Deafheaven}'s fourth studio album since 2011. Since their second album, {album : Sunbather}, the group has expanded beyond the limits of {genre : black metal}. This album is their most expansive effort to date, taking its inspiration from {name : Graham Greene} and {name : Julio Cortázar}.

{host : Jim} says the sweet and sour sonic combination works well for him. The cathartic release is there, but with a bit of hope to avoid total despair.

{host : Greg} says the songs that stick closer to the {genre : metal}/{genre : shoegaze} hybrid of their previous albums are great, but some of the more experimental tracks fall flat for him. He says {track : Night People} is a goth ballad that belongs on the American Horror Story soundtrack, while {track : You Without End} is a Broadway song with a guitar solo straight out of a {artist : Queen} or {artist : Boston} album from the 1970s.



## 00:15:37 Interview: Alice Cooper

![Alice](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/661/Q10.jpg)

This week, {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} revist their 2015 interview with {genre : shock-rock} legend {artist : Alice Cooper}. Cooper was born in {place : Detroit} but later moved to {place : Arizona} for high school, where he was a teenage jock in a rock band. His group, {artist : The Spiders}, performed around {place : Phoenix} and {place : LA} for a few years before they changed their name to Alice Cooper (Alice's real name is Vincent Furnier.) Their first couple albums {album : *Pretties For You*}and {album : *Easy Action*} didn't gain much traction but once they teamed up with producer {name : Bob Ezrin}, they found success with the album {album : *Love It to Death*}. A string of popular records followed such as {album : *School's Out*}, {album : *Billion Dollar Babies*} and {album : *Welcome to My Nightmare*} but for a time, critics couldn't see past the group's on-stage antics. Alice is perhaps most famous for his special brand of shock-rock including props like snakes, guillotines and even straight jackets. Jim and Greg were very excited to speak with Cooper and discuss his on-stage persona, sobriety, music catalogue and relationships with other famous artists.



## 00:43:40 DIJ: Jim & Greg


### Jim

{artist : Glenn Branca} passed away on May 13th at the age of 69. Jim's {tag : desert island jukebox} pick highlights Glenn's contribution to the nascent {genre : noise}, and {genre : no-wave} scene in {place : New York} in the {era : early 1980s}, an exciting time when there were "no lines between what was going to blow up as {genre : hip-hop}, what was going to blow up as {genre : graffiti art} and {genre : experimental noise}, but also [there were no lines between] {genre : pop} music and {genre : rock and roll} and the remnants of {era : punk}." Artists and break dancers alike were winding up in the same place. Against that backdrop, Glenn released {album : The Ascension} in {era : 1981}, which combined "{genre : avant-classical} composition, {tag : multi-harmonics} and {tag : dissonance}" with a "lot of {tag : feedback}". Jim remembers that watching the {artist : Glenn Branca Ensemble} at {place : CBGB} was like "top of your head sheared off, brain spilling on the floor". For his pick, Jim chose {track : Lesson # 2} from Glenn's album {album : The Ascension}, "which is really where [Glenn's career] begins".


### Greg

{host : Greg} is also heading to the Desert Island thing week with a track by a group inspired by {artist : Glenn Branca} - {artist : Sonic Youth}. He selected the track "{track : Silver Rocket}" from the group's 1988 album {album : Daydream Nation}. "Silver Rocket" channels the melding of chaotic guitars, dramatic volume changes and more than Branca pioneered and Sonic Youth perfected.
