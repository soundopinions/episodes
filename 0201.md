## 00:02:02 Intro: Music News

In the news this week is {name : President Obama}'s appointment of {name : Victoria Espinel} as the new {tag : Intellectual Property} Enforcement Coordinator, or as she'll likely be known, IP Czar. {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} talk to {name : Michael Bracy}, the Policy Director at the {tag : Future of Music Coalition}, about this appointment. Bracy gets the sense that Espinel stands pretty safely down the middle of {tag : copyright} issues and believes the Obama administration is more concerned with access to internet and competition. He explains that until a legitimate digital media marketplace fully evolves, it remains to be seen how {tag : copyright laws} should be changed and approached differently in the courts. Bracy and the folks at the FMC will be continuing discussions on this topic and more at their annual summit this weekend in {place : Washington D.C.}

One of the biggest music releases this year is actually not an album, but a {tag : video game}. {tag : The Beatles: Rock Band} was released to much hype and acclaim last month. Since the release of {tag : Guitar Hero} in 2005, and then {tag : Rock Band} in 2007, $3 billion worth of these games have been sold. It's a successful new revenue stream for an industry in dire need of a boost. {host : Jim} and {host : Greg} have been critical of games like this before on *Sound Opinions*. They wonder where the music fits in and suggest that perhaps music fans would be better off playing actual music. But there's a lot of anecdotal evidence to suggest that games like Rock Band encourage kids to learn music. Jim and Greg discuss these pros and cons with {name : Greg LoPiccolo}, one of the brains behind Guitar Hero and Rock Band. As the Vice President of Product Development at {tag : Harmonix}, LoPiccolo was involved with bringing {artist : The Beatles} on board.



## 00:35:26 Review: The Flaming Lips

{artist : The Flaming Lips} are back with their 12th album, {album : Embryonic}. The band has been around for three decades now, which some people wouldn't expect from a bunch of {genre : psychedelic rock}ers from {place : Oklahoma}. {host : Jim}, who wrote about the band in his book {tag : *Staring at Sound: The True Story of Oklahoma's Fabulous Flaming Lips*}, has been waiting for them to return to their roots. They are rocking out again on *Embryonic*, and while they've done this sound before, and better, he gives the album a {tag : Buy It}. Greg agrees that they are moving in the right direction. The fans may wonder where the {genre : pop} songs are, but he's fascinated to hear them attempt the {genre : jazz}ier material. {host : Greg} applauds the ambition, but finds the execution lacking. He gives *Embryonic* a {tag : Burn It}.



## 00:44:44 Review: The Gossip

![Music for Men (Deluxe Version)](https://static.soundopinions.org/assets/201/22K0.jpg)

Next up is a review of {album : Music for Men}, the major label debut from {artist : The Gossip}. The underground trio is fronted by {name : Beth Ditto}, whom Jim describes as a {tag : feminist} and gay activist, as well as a "{tag : Fat-Activist}." Her onstage persona caught the attention of superstar producer {name : Rick Rubin}, who brought the band to {label : Columbia}. Unfortunately, as {host : Greg} relays, Rubin did the band no favors. The drumming sounds crisp and precise, but Ditto's voice has been stripped of its bluesy passion. A disheartened {host : Jim} agrees. If he weren't married, and Ditto weren't gay, Jim says he'd want to marry her. But you get none of her life force on this album. Both critics give {album : Music for Men} a {tag : Trash It}.
